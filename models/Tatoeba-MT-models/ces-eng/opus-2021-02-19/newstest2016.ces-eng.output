On an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During the call to the emergency line, with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and needed them to come to their home.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at the house, and that contacts to a dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten report on white office paper: "I am so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she is the only one who ever loved me," said a letter that the authorities said Lamb signed.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fatal call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting, the students and the faculty were forced to hide behind locked doors, the authorized authorities were still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by the state investigators as well as by the students and employees who knew him together created an image of a talented but likely troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote in thanking the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with 17 other faculty members and many students took courses at the same time.
At the same time, there have been inclinations in terms of problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed aggravated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for a medical leave when he stated that he had some sort of problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard for would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
President William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba was obviously troubled."
Lamb won't answer those questions again.
After he left campus, the police picked up his trail crossing the Arkansas state line back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot from a gun in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed by Washington State coroner Methel Johnson.
He left the car running on the street.
It was unclear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at the University, which has 3500 students in the city, which number around 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
In the spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambo was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older guy who spent years tutoring her to play guitar.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The hearts of all the girls were severed as soon as it appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposedly dating for a while.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the arm of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She was my best friend with my mother.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail went to the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a savings bar near Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, the pot that Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything bad.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We used to play tricks and record each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a professor killed, led a first-year seminar and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a boys' student club and the government of students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students, and community members, attended a candlelight reminder.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and Jeff Schnidt's brother also attended a vigil during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there's no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us declare that they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children's toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, which is a decrease from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit staff during October until December.
While vacations themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to assist in shops and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," said the trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in time."
The movie starts, and I realize I'm within reach of something you might call a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in time," is a documentary about "Back in the Future," which presents interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It is truly the best travel document for me that has ever been filmed."
"Back in time" will be available for VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
The head of the United Nations says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of almost five years and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions.
Once again, the UN Chief has urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at the Wednesday press conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the outskirts of the Ministerial Meeting of the General Assembly at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching Iran’s nuclear resolution agreement in Syria.
8 election numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to identify him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands at it like a joke gone wrong.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of double digits, and some people are starting to seriously ask what that means for the nomination chances of this real estate mogul.
Of course, it is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry’s leadership made the way for Herman Cain’s rise, not one of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into a general election.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeb Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and begin to unload their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that a real estate tycoon is not just a fleeting phase:
Trump's favor assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University voted that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was already 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick to the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac university vote last week, 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they'd be "indignant" about his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "excited" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters claim that they would be "dissatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush's favorite company became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his pompousness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationalally inclined to the idea that the real estate tycoon has the right temperament for the presidency, according to the Monday vote ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held at the Iowa state senator's club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think that he does not have a personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When he puts on his scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's the late July change, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as a winner of the run against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump as credible.
Even though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump’s leadership while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University poll at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He leads Carly Fiona by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman at a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one game.
The bare majority of Donald Trump's followers claim they've already made up their minds.
A new Tuesday's CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of Trump's supporters claim that they will not change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep an open back door for a change among the candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider's colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his campaign's announcement speech, immigration has still been the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump's pompousness will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage to rebranding efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the theme of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain, too.
Frustration from the government is reaching a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now receiving roughly half the support from Republican voters, especially given their condition as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post vote on Monday say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "disgruntled" and 21 percent are "hell angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state from the coal levy.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the Government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the yield of tax on surface lignite mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that this would give them extra money both from the Treasury and from the municipalities' budgets.
The draft was criticised by opposition members who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the Government amendment to the Mining Act at first reading, which means, among other things, that the State should receive a larger part of the yield of fees from surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The state’s share will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating the payment for minerals that companies will benefit from.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, municipalities’ budget revenues are to have a neutral impact, as the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million from fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
From the mining of brown coal the municipalities went about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase of the remuneration from the tilling areas with allowed mining to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments is to remain fully owned by the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities would gain between CZK 14 million and CZK 100 million each year instead of CZK 100 million.
The amount of the mining charges will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement shall be calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned against the need to comply with the Constitution for setting a fee.
However, according to Minister Mládek, it is not a tax in this case, because the State charges the mineral which is state property.
Fees shall be paid only to municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three quarters of the municipality’s money and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same ratio will also be in the case of radioactive rock mining.
Part of the money that the State collects on the mining charges will be assigned to it.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Osvit) elected in the Ústí Region.
Hana Aulická warned the KSČM MP about the increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kadner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term agreed.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel price rises.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by seeking to reduce their operating expenditure, which would, above all, result in a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in employment fees is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on Milan Urban's amendment (ČSSD), it is crucial for Members to know before passing the law the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the yields for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the mine of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should break for social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy will lead the Czechs as a leader, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board at the Davis Cup game on Thursday, and this time each one of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the load over the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
There is hot and high humidity in Delhi, so challenging matches are expected to stretch to up to five hundred.
We have to take that into consideration.
I'd like to spread it according to the weather.
And according to how it will look, he said Navrátil during today's Czech selection training in the center of Raja Kumara Khanny.
With the number one team and the world forty Jiří Veselý counts for Friday and Sunday doubles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will probably turn to position two.
I'd like almost everyone involved.
I've got it slow in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be the participation of Štěpánek in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who will stand next to an experienced deblist who has a 18-to-4 double in the Davis Cup.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There are options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know with whom and how it will look," said Navrátil.
It will decide on the development of the doubles.
The variant can be Pavlásek, with Veselý surprised in the first round by winning in the deble over the Australians.
"He's a decent son of a bitch," said Navrátil.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to do the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I am glad for the experience and I would like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The landlord puts Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ranking), who won last week’s challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the players third and fourth hundred rankings.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challengers, and our parents have experience in the ATP Tour, but we've been convinced a lot of times that the Davis Cup rankings don't make decisions.
"Deciding the current form, the weather," said Navrátil.
Friday's opening doubles will start at 6:30 A.M.S. and they can reach out due to the weather.
It's supposed to rain, and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it may be played under artificial lighting.
They've lit it up and it's got some 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," said Navrátil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Mr Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very enthusiastically expected from his election
Jeremy Corbyn's new job manager will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and he will have his first collaboration with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement he asked "less theatres and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech on Tuesday to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to stand quietly during the singing of the national anthem on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative Members and is the focus of several stories on the headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he would be "standing in respectful silence" and that he would acknowledge "the royal air force's heroship in the battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would recommend to the Labour leader a national anthem to sing "no matter what" on his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in economics, defenses and foreign affairs, and only less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
Political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "stirring" after Mr Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's dose limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the working party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has 'from the crowd' ideas for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "rapid responses" and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not participate — such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he let himself be heard that he was still discussing the matter with the Speaker of the House, John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to divert from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leadership of leaders, their leadership of the House and their position among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and that far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photoshooting in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The Johannesburg Center is a difficult place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising, while the UK’s salary growth is accelerating
The pound came up with the following data and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while FTSE 100 was led above by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB gains, including bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and seemed to be approaching estimates when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped by 20% after he received a close-up offer from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine two of the largest breweries in the world, and a close-up of brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry stock was 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the rival group of luxury Richemont goods.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
The Glencore shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said they increased by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt-reduction strategy.
The shares in Mondi's packaging and paper group were the biggest drop on the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs lowered his rating on the company's "sale."
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports company reported 83% jump in mid-year profits before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages could hurt expansion.
The executive president of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he states.
The costs could affect the plans to expand JD Sports, added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of Prague apartment are cheering for the marshmallow.
Controversial building's got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision illegal and will be appealed against.
A petition was also launched against the construction, which is to be built in close proximity to the Anez Monastery in the center of Prague, protested by 1 hundred people before the Prague Office.
The Magistrate stated in the decision that there had been a breach of the building law because not all the elements of the territorial decision had been complied with.
"The relevant territorial decision does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the clearly and clearly described shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory affected by the construction influence," the decision states.
It also considers that certain documents for the decision were issued for the original documentation under discussion, which has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
However, it follows from the file that the landowner only supported the approval of the project documentation for the zoning procedure, not the approval of the location of the building on its plots, writes the Department of Construction Regulations.
According to Francesco August Razett of the investor company, the construction department did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the time limit for the initiation of the review has already expired.
Anyway, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in the press release.
The project that people call marshmallow because of the supposedly proposed colour of the facade is causing strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have met in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
The association and residents of nearby homes are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anez Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
Based on the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ), the Ministry of Culture rejected the original form of the project from 2008, which counted with the glass facade, and cancelled the permission of Prague monumentists in 2010.
The new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the SAO as well as by the City Hall of Monuments and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the complaints of opponents, he said he never counted on the facade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname after pink and white confectionery.
The Czech politician drove migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in jail.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees to his car, who were reported to be carrying about a half mile [half km].
At the time, he said it was not criminal in Hungary, he said to Lidové noviny.
We knew law enforcement wasn't affected by this kind of behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and taken into custody in Szeged, he described the paper.
Finally, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police said they behaved correctly, but communication was stuck, because they did not speak very good English.
According to him, however, prison was sad.
In our cell, for example, about three by four metres [3 m] in size, 15 refugees from Syria were in distress.
Among them was a two - year - old boy or a four - year - old girl.
These people were locked up there the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What can't he confiscate?

Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from the strain of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added with brands such as Dunsborough based Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings in IGA stores and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football leagues to local customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of his defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors will celebrate their annual investor strategic day.
The stakes are high because southern and western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA shops enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take up 5 percent of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of opening the first stores that took over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In his report this week, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierah, estimated that the retail trade of IGA could lose USD 360 million on annual sales and Metcash USD 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in southern Australia and 30 in western during the next year, and will generate sales of USD 500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million in pre-tax yields, confirmed Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the latest survey by Roy Morgan found that the buyers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the head manager of the Hamish Douglass fund, founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "probably disappear over a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it's known that a board member of Metcash contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA fell from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and the earnings from the Metcash food trade, which is supplied by around 1200 retailes of IGA, fell by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation, as sales and returns are under pressure.
However, wholesale went into a counterattack and invested more than USD 150 million a year to balance counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, helping IGA reintroduce shops by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
The Executive Director of Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the pricing and refurbishing programs will take a turn and hope that the wholesale will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by the President of Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become collateral damage in recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, reports President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself through an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after that, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka had one to stretch out to Kyrgios and I had to stretch out to him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after the spasm ruined his possible defeat of Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis unwaveringly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a second double position behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I have been very intensely thinking about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed the rocket when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S., but he's not the first player to take his anger out on his rocket because of frustration, and I know Thanasi pretty well, and I can tell he's not proud of this event.
But he really handled himself very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits perfectly into the team and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I simply think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios because of an important match that starts on Friday, and states that "settlement decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the Canberry native to return to the team as long-term sticklers.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not all the controversy that has arisen around him [Kyrgios]," Healy says.
And I think Nick was rising very fast, as Federer, Murray and others point out, growing rapidly in the public's eyes, making some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time beyond the spotlight, when he'll be able to think about it, is in my opinion the best solution for the team and for him himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency situation, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the threat to Hungary on Tuesday, it closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in no one's country, and Serbian authorities reacted outraged.
Those who have been stranded for an unknown time on land belts between two states stand those who run from violence in their native lands, building tents and settling in.
But here comes the feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants call together "Open the border!" and call the Hungarian police unit a riot.
Some reject food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister claims that it was 'unacceptable' for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
It will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries over the next few days," claims Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-state block did not come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of reaching a possible agreement for another month or at the end of the year, which would have been accepted by the EU’s peoples of more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU summit on Tuesday another week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not hold its hope to Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the threat situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the Romanian border to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the Serbian border fence is now completed.
CBS News corepondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped draw barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point in the European Union for refugees, many of whom fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary are now criminalizing the violation of a four-metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also setting longer time limits in prison for those illegally transferring refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesperson in the southern town of Szed, told reporters.
We are quite clear on this: illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must still approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but reporters of the Associated Press at the border have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an advisor to Orban for home defense, said that the authorities had captured 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already caught on state territory.
They have breached the fence and are now in police custody charged with committing offences under new laws.
The authorities had the fence fixed quickly.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with barbed wire.
The main border crossing near Roszke created chaos, because Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and people were pushing.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands remain outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's kickoff before Bernie Sanders fell by half in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up on her lead.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of democratic primary voters (less than 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (more than 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is to announce in the meantime whether or not he wants to become president, receives support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the opening of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too early to say that there are clear decisions that will support the candidate.
But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost ground in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained some.
Clinton keeps a big head start between women and eases, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among the men has decreased significantly and Sanders has only lost 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with the democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and they are now equal with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a lot of leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is only losing five points in this group.
About half the democratic primary voters in the whole state say that she would be enthusiastically supportive of Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I guess it's no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly passionate about her.
The views are mixed among those that currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same thing about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), it is time for her to be president (13 percent), and she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, there is a great opportunity to choose and agree on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidacy for president, 57 percent of democratic primary voters would like him to face it - one-third think he should not run again.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the nomination of the party, Biden was the most common choice.
Among Clinton’s supporters, more than half of Biden made their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will spread from 20 points when Biden runs for office to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to choose is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of more importance for the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over more chances of being elected.
Like last month, not one democratic candidate or potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have that view of him.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As the questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as a state secretary continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of her has not been affected at all.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on the subject were already divided in March, shortly after the problem became apparent.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have deteriorated their view of Clinton.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party voters, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a drop by eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush did the best in honesty.
Sanders is seen by more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters haven't made up their minds about him.
The error margin for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in the national election.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest poll, and others are getting support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a overwhelming majority, and they climbed from 23% support in the latest CBS poll before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well across demographic groups, excluding Trump from university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the 10% support stage with the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The error margin for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The most recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of Republican support for Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
In the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot a retired neurosurgeon blindly, and even Carson apologized for questioning Trump's beliefs.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged with the death of a first-year Baruch College student
Almost two years after the student died during the overloading brotherly ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, she was charged with murder against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the ceremony opening in September 2013 and the delayed took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
Police say that he was blindfolded, had a backpack full of sand weighing 30 pounds in total, and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, claims the police.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the well-being of brotherhood to the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with blunt force trauma to the head, torso, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overburden in brotherhoods and at least one student dies every year because of overload since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
The brotherhood and their members must be responsible, and this step is important by the institutions.
The grand jury of Monroe County has recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault by overburden and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to detain not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will drive them to account too," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned brotherhood, and the national brotherhood abolished its relationship with local branches.
This takes tents when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate growth will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna take.
For the economy specifically offers the history of a small author about timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressivity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when tariff increases start, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss about increasing speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase of the Fed from the time of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money era'," said Julian Jessop, leading global economist Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more common but still low will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in about a month, the expected increase in rates can make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for the resumption of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank's analysts reported in a recent study on what will happen after the increase in the Fed.
More precisely, the market has often been the most - about 14 percent - in the last 35 years - heading towards an increase in rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main stock strategist of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares tends to become more pronounced later in the rate increase cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rising rates often help her.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could speed up the recession.
Most noteworthy is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history when increasing Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice the nominal year-on-year GDP increase was below 4.5 percent during the 118 increase in rates since 1950.
Despite the fact that it was 3.6 percent in 2015 Q2, few expect it to be maintained when it was only 1.5 percent in 2015 Q3, reports the Atlanta Fed.
Increasing rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "if this is a different time," said Deutsche.
Market participants were ready to grow the Fed for a whole year, and all eyes turned to the Federal Free Market Committee meeting this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all increase cycles have so far been in the super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this has clearly been a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those the Feds have waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still continuing.
The firm return was also volatile because the market expects to raise rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what shares are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is faster seen on bonds than on shares when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, returns appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle of raising bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that raising rates will bring revenue closer between long-term and short-term bonds to equal the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we are still careful about tightening the yield," Kathy Jones, a firm analyst for fixed income at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that conduct most of their business in the US will win after an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Transnational companies with a lot of debt will do worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market area, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to be overcome within three months of the initial rate increase," said Goldman Sachsve's analysts in the customer report.
In any interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004, weak balance sheets companies were overtaken by 5 percentage points on average.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility stocks, also surpassed their counterparts of lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers also benefit from a growing dollar.
Savings can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "thundering"
He believes that he is becoming more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British.
My colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says neither is he an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, claims the leading MP and amassing fresh pressure on the broadcast to show that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's bosses that the public service radio station seems to be "stupid" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "tuned" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Bingham said.
The director general of the BBC rejected the charges, stating that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and making music is actually top-notch.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, regulator BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire due to treading on the heels of business competitors during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing committee.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talp Media at an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" next time he started a fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending money taxpayers' royalties on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have been growing at the slowest rate since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth since 2000 began
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday might be a reason to stop spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making many British major streets ghost cities.
However, experts argue that there are signs of a steady-state online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of a steady-state online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth level over the past years and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," says Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index for the Guardian.
It explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to go away.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken over from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers might abstain from shopping before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more than the average of the shoppers turned to their computers to arrange their purchases and knock down several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which customers are recontracting, can keep customers from further purchases
Research published by British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the crane crash in Mecca, and the Bin Laden family was sanctioned.
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred through the streets by Muslims in the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the construction tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of a crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the grieving chose the path and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen got on his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell upon the believers.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned a building group of the bin Laden family over a disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Haj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already promised that haj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadine Group shouldn't have left the crane arm up when it wasn't in service.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state operated by the Saudi press agency, states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the fall.
The English services of the disk agency did not report this detail, but stated that the company’s bosses were forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims smith before the pilgrimage of Haj later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued a statement of the collapse of the crane and its comment representatives have not been made available.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not applying the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades and run large construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was the son of an apostate whose family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in the midst of strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom at a pilgrimage that every able - bodied Muslim must undergo at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still staying in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be dedicated to relatives killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
Chief B&Q claims that Eastern European traders working for cheap is no longer a trend
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, argues Veronique Laury
The number of traders taught in Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is open 200 Screwfix stores focused on traders
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Processed by Rupert Steiner, Head Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are supposed to put aside hammers and brushes and hand them over to employed East European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY at their home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for domestic needs, claims that the large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores focused on traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms Laury claims that she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halfs.
At present, most of the workers are male.
She said that there is a need to address rising demographic trends that depict more female households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Ms. Laury says, "Mans still work in our stores.
We need to get close to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% decisions about buying goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies under the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between directors of men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial director.
Ms Laury says: 'It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher announced a fall in profits in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing the shops.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, Vice-President of TOP 09, who emphasized the principle of merit.
President of the ODS Zbyněk Stanjura commented that a one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard ad valoremation because it would be reflected in future years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to arrange it," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which the next year should have been indexed beyond the law.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she didn't think was pink.
The higher ad valoremation next year would mean a budget impact of CZK 5.5 billion and the ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorization had decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The Veto right significantly complicates the payout in December and may even make it impossible, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore, proposed a reduction of the time limit for the discussion of the standard in committee to 10 or 20 days, even the right blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the coming year, pensions should increase by an average of about a hundred crowns.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be given to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension before it was paid out in December.
However, they would have to apply for a surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions are regularly indexed in the Czech Republic as of January, namely price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314,7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full-time pension last year increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10.714 according to data in the state closing account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided payment of 2.4 million full retirement pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin abandoned his plans for a political career, he will pursue science.
According to Russian media, the Senate chair was almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate for the United Russia government party, defended his post in the Sunday elections with an overview.
According to Russian laws, senators are not elected by citizens, but selected by the governor from three candidates whose names they will announce before the Gubernatorial elections.
After the election, he chooses the senator from the three candidates himself.
The complication was for Jakuna that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by the law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin that he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The last straw in the main hero's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who ran out of strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurová decided on Grandpa's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to John that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
He longs to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the former one, he told the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedy form a kind of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning it was clear that the main role would fall to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Yet, he was said to have been surprised by the actor who appeared on camera after a longer break associated with recovery after a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a smoky athlete.
He used to ask where he would sit before shooting.
This time he rode a bike, climbed rocks and even went uphill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director said.
According to Bartoshka, women marry tigers to turn them into rabbits over time.
They'll pour him some food, but they'll close the door so he doesn't accidentally think to play tiger outside the rabbit's den.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented.
His wife, who can be slightly negative to the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic, and she means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurper, and she wants to take care of her husband to death, he said Bajgar.
The film depicts the fates of John's married daughters Olina and Alice - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the sons-in-laws Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Televisia Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, an American Internet company, promised to provide up to $5.5 million more to organizations that help thousands of refugees streaming to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is a charity branch of this online company.
Azerbaijan has cancelled Telička's visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the YES movement Pavel Telička postponed the upcoming Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official visit today.
According to Telička, this is justified by the EP resolution of last week, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička was co-author of.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party Telička lost the opportunity to talk to the official partners and also to visit political prisoners, which depend on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in the press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of Parliament and executive representatives as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, to specify the text sent to the Czech News Agency.
The EP resolution condemns 'the unprecedented repression of civil society in Azerbaijan'.
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadija Ismail, who advocated the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not rule out, during his visit to Novosibirsk, that a Russian air base would be established in Syria in the future.
We don't have those plans yet.
Nothing's out of the question, he said.
Russia has an old naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which has so far been used more as a service and logistics centre.
But, according to reports from the Russian press, supplies of Russian equipment and military equipment to Syria have increased since early August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to establish an air base near Latakia, which remains for now the bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, and American commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Tuesday about the situation in Syria with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov, it was their third phone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to convey concern about the gathering of Russian arsenals near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Assad's support from Moscow a losing bet.
He said of Russia's policy objectives in Syria that they were rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing rather a long-term goal, but what is, according to Earnest, not entirely clear.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculation by the Russian press, is supposed to be the main issue of Putin's speech at the forthcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader is not going to talk about the situation in Donbas, Ukraine.
According to today’s report of The New York Times, the US government does not rule out President Barack Obama meeting with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
But the views of the White House counsellors are still falling apart.
TASS said today, referring to the words of Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov, that Putin has not yet met Obama on the agenda for his New York residence.
Put sesame oil on the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressed from cold seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common reason for the death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in heat treatment of meals and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in bile diet.
Essential fatty acids, which it contains, are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems concern particularly overweight people who do not sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used on a liver diet that is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that come from consuming this oil, they should watch out for the goods from exotic food stores.
Asian manufacturers often use overroasted seeds that have a more pronounced taste for pressing.
However, the oil will lose all the active substances, said Ladislav Hačecký, Executive Director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslice to Sokolov, which produces cold-pressed organic virgin oils.
The company also newly produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press will be able to emboss 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives on heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerská's research, which she led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
It is not really suitable for frying, however, it is already starting to overheat at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, for seasoning salads and is especially suitable in diets in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids lower cholesterol levels most.
In case of heart problems, care must be taken about the amount of fat and calories received in general.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoonful of sunflower oil, 99 calories in the spoonful of rapeseed oil.
As far as the energy value of food is concerned, it is important to note that natural foods with nutrients are much more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as much as sesame and hemp for nine months.
Storage in the fridge will prolong the shelf life.
Old oil can be seen especially by bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no glaucoma at the bottom of the defect.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Cannabis oil contains the most healthy acids.
Since the seeds of technical cannabis are among the so - called superfoods, hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be taken from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while Icelanders accept 2.5 grams of it.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Cannabis oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People need not be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that it is one of the best-selling companies in Bohemia Olej.
It sells 500 grand a year.
People often use one spoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Cannabis oil is not tasteful, but excellently strengthens immunity, advised Daniel Vlček of the karsl company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, Americans are the most passionate nation of barbecuers.
For one household, there's 1.4 grills.
All over the world there are various barbecue competitions that only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There aren't even Czechs back there.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives have not barbecued.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
To make the barbecue successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before heat treatment.
At the same time, which oil is the most suitable for the barbecue, while retaining a healthy substance?
Generally, in the process of grilling itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that much of the oils begin to lose their appetite at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from foods treated at lower temperatures.
It does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils will not find their application during the barbecue.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from Bohemia Olej from Kraslice to Sokolov immediately equip themselves with grape oil.
It perfectly complements the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen features a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech producers of this grape oil, describes the benefits of grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we help to enhance our external beauty as well - it improves skin elasticity, is used in acne treatment and helps to care for dry and brittle hair.
Chefs appreciate the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for preparing cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for heat treatment of dishes.
There are two ways to use barbecues, marinating and grilling.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juicyness.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, the acidity will be added to apple vinegar to soften the flesh.
Spices give the meat a taste and oil preserves and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it can pass through dark meat as one of the few oils.
So the marinated meat or fish are ready for barbecue, how do we proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare the dishes.
Same goes for barbecues.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This concerns mainly flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Rub oil on the grate before grilling so you can prevent burning food.
Preparation of attachments is also an essential part of the barbecue.
Almost anything is suitable for grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, a hot summer salad.
You need: • 1 peach • 1 bundle of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaves mixture • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a mixture of lettuce leaves, sliced cucumbers and large cubes chopped peach.
Salt and pepper based on the taste, you can also taste ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drip with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just the medication that matters, it's the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of professionals: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultations if they decide to have a child, care for these patients includes social legal advice, recommendations for housing treatment, etc.
Yet all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and do not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors point out, the patient’s passivity frees space for disease activity.
For example, regular movement is shown to significantly delay the time when the patient needs a compensatory aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to different myths, such as that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That's why the Give a Chance page was created (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give a Chance.
The most important person in the care of the sick with multiple sclerosis is the neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, there is a saying twice that the sooner the disease starts, the more likely something the doctor can influence.
It is because we have medicines for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory stage when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop and delay disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often solves weakening of the lower limbs or disorder of balance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve gait, strengthen pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It is really individual, depending on the specific problems of the patient," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it is manifested in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
Movement activity, however, also strengthens the immune condition of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick are verifying what they can do, and that strengthens their confidence.
"The endorphins are also washed out during the exercise and you feel good about it," warns PhDr. Kamila Řásová of the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, adds.
"These patients were previously spared, today we know that they need a targeted burden," says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the University Hospital in Motol.
Physiotherapy is intended to enable a person to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including work assignments.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to get each person a compensation aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it usually shakes people.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With a sore soul like this, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to take everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them in such a way that they eventually conclude that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the airbuses would not fly.
Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
New planes are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can't easily make and process.
Yet, next to super-precision, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for forming composites, you can encounter something as ordinary as apricot stones.
In a drum that resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are brushed around in a pile of stones.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of Latecoere Czech Republic air door manufacturer.
In the area in Prague Letňany, the former Letov manufactures a complete door for Airbus A320.
They're the only ones in the world who deliver the door to the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Passengers also enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world's largest air transport aircraft Airbus A380 through the doors, the part of which is built in Prague.
There is also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the moment keys are being adjusted twice a year by the company.
If the yellow sticker lacks an inspection record, they should explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing at the Prague plant who regularly travel to find out if the doors are manufactured according to agreed rules.
But the advanced technology has not yet completely replaced human senses.
There are 1500 rivets on one of the A320 doors.
The rivets must shake them manually.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer, they'll know if the rivet's shaking properly.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet may rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
That's about twice the thickness of human hair.
When you check, it comes down to a trained touch.
If the controller runs his finger over a series of rivets, he'll know if there's any outside tolerance.
Then he'll take the exact spectrometer.
The flight was fed before 1989 by a training aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, none of them were made.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
That's when she hooked up with the European Airbus manufacturer.
She won the tender for the emergency door supplier for model A321.
Courting with Boeing wasn't that happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee the Boeing long-term stable supply," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain locked if Letov did not take the French group Latecoere to the Prague conference of the International Aviation Association in 1999.
I was there talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, says Dubsky.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
In 2000, the assembly of parts of the doors for A320 started.
Three years later, the upper deck door was added to the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new warehouse for composite processing for deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we couldn't have gotten ourselves into these big jobs.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
Partners want 20 or 30-year supply guarantees, explains Dubsky.
Last year the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
An exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certifications and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't have made any airplane doors.
To obtain certificates that production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated checks to keep them worth millions of crowns according to Dubský.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and tighter.
We have to train the staff, equip the equipment and re-certification the whole process, adds Dubský.
The company is now completing the preparation of the process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace harmful cadmium for human health.
They got the assignments from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The Boeing people are coming, checking out the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, explaining Dubsky's way of controlling them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for Prague company.
With the Prague plant today stands and the production of embraers falls.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of doors.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for Brazilian or European producers.
However, this does not mean that he could say anything behind the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It says how much one door will cost in tens, fifty, hundreds of made pieces.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we'll be losing money, says Dubsky.
Half the hall where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M are assembled is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen there is a new semi-robotic line for riveting and assembly of doors for the innovative model A320 Neo.
The riveting will accelerate and refine.
"This is the trend that is taking place in aviation assembly," Dubský adds.
Sales have a future line secured.
Airbus reports that the airlines have so far ordered 3278 units of the new A320 model.
Just a few meters away, there will be a line for complete assembly of the door for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubsky.
Before that, however, the company must pass the qualification tests, for example, for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, she should participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský proudly says.
Latecoere, however, reaches the edge of production capacities in the Czech Republic.
There's no more place in Letov, where it's based.
Before the French mother entered, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of themselves, how many hundreds of new planes are ordered every year, they need not worry about work.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead, the mother company of Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money for the September loan payments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she exchanged some of the loans with them for shares.
Creditors acquired 37.4 percent of the company’s capital increase by EUR 57.4 million.
The debt of the company fell by two thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company subscribed new shares for EUR 222,9 million among existing shareholders.
In total, it raised core capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of the sales.
The average growth of orders is expected by 4% per year until 2017.
The order book has orders worth EUR 2.6 billion, which corresponds to four years of production.
The French media say that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the IVs.
The Czech competition in Prague Letňany is important for groups.
16 percent contribute to the group’s sales.
According to the number of employees is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The MPs supported a larger share of the state from the coal levy.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, municipalities’ budget revenues are to have a neutral impact, as the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million from fees and the state budget CZK 150 million.
From the mining of brown coal the municipalities went about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration from the tilling areas with allowed mining to CZK 1 000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments is to remain fully owned by the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities would gain between CZK 14 million and CZK 100 million each year instead of CZK 100 million.
The amount of the mining charges will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement shall be calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned against the need to comply with the Constitution for setting a fee.
However, according to Minister Mládek, it is not a tax in this case, because the State charges the mineral which is state property.
Fees shall be paid only to municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three quarters of the municipality’s money and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same ratio will also be in the case of radioactive rock mining.
Part of the money that the State collects on the mining charges will be assigned to it.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Osvit) elected in the Ústí Region.
Hana Aulická warned the KSČM MP about the increase in unemployment in Mosteck.
Kadner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory memorandum states that the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term agreed.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel price rises.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by seeking to reduce their operating expenditure, which would, above all, result in a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in employment fees is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on Milan Urban's amendment (ČSSD), it is crucial for Members to know before passing the law the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits.
If coal is mined beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the yields for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the mine of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should break for social, economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the American Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching America’s Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists approached by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for a while and leave interest rates within 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historical event, because it's been a long time since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get off the zero bar and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy was doing quite well, there was a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared for an increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this move.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 CET.
Shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later the same day also his colleague - wrote a note saying that he was "sorry" for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, revealed on Tuesday the government authorities.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, reported that Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at around 10:00 a.m.
and said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house who would "not bother anyone", but he was upset.
The police demanded the names of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also failed to explain why the house was being shot.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamba saying: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving a note, Lamb went on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt's history teacher and then took his own life.
Dean of the University William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, the government authorities said that there was no "no evidence" about the "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shaking" the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss's, as Sun Herald said, Prentiss worked from home online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb talked to his relatives on Monday and said he was not going to jail.
When the police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school’s website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta University in spring 2015.
Stars That Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for possession in 2008.
Surely all these things take their toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a couple of months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture during the Manchester United defeat at the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this injury in tears and eliminated it for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound was caused by the reckless Héctor Moreno procedure in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw snuck into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe the day after, and then he'll continue to operate in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 years old has it very hard, but he plays fantastically, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture takes six months of treatment and won't be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he'll still play this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injuries in defeat against PSF
The English defenseman will have added motivation for recovery in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Coco, PSF coach, said, "It was a very bad injury."
When any player leaves the field with that kind of injury, everyone gets very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It is very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt his opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such injury, it is not good," he said.
I haven't been able to see this moment.
All I saw was a ball pointing in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke's procedure.
In an interview with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long for them to learn almost by heart.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
After asking the child scheme provider to name his favorite children's book, he chose the Prime Minister Lorax, a 1971 Dr Seuss fable.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, which I liked to read to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had never seen before."
Well, except in the next paragraph Cameron reportedly described the story of the book according to the 2012 elevator, which added other characters and details to fill out a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of a girl of her dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is a brief content of a book that records an object of love unknown to Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodore Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it weren't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads like a summary lift of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words, "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Since he was openly a practical parent, Cameron seems unlikely to get acquainted with the story of a book where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by the avaricious, tree-cutting industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a crouched, schnauzy creature who speaks for the trees.
Most likely, a relatively minor PR assignment was given to an assistant who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokesman at Downing Street said that the text probably came from Cameron's followers' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron's employee provided the text, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of forgetting England, but he still holds
It is a difficult task to compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but after seeing the team that England has chosen for this tour, I do not think it will be very likely to repeat the 3-0 defeat suffered in the trial series last time.
I wouldn't exactly rule out winning guests either.
Alastair Cook's party may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting lineup and collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to ignore Adam Lyth is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are judged by performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement because — and I mentioned earlier — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century, and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performance was not 100%, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time a batter gets to show up is a tough one.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outdoors.
The only thing you could complain about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean first — even though Lyth was in the best shape — but this wasted opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a batter who I'm very positive with.
He's an x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will of course depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, was raised and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't launch and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 to them, and there's no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer first played his first 38 exams before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded for three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari is joining the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to follow him, I was intrigued by him as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a pram, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors chose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a hitter from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches can be a master move.
He's one of the most beautiful guys playing, who brings in a wealth of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, although they are voices that say consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Even if many disagree, coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-conceived renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with every other day without electing the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn headed the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take over the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they didn't want it, even if they were to undermine social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's selfie.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain in Europe to get into it - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, German cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the continued Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their legs to help the Selfies of the British who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want themselves to do because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 referendum campaign in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, says a friend.
"Renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiations."
Europeans know to their own harm how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU are the press oligarchs, because they were not inspired by Tony Benn during the referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, a sneaky Euro-opportunist who made his name as Brussels rapporteur for "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-free scoundrels, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a furious gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't eat you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband has been more like Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of a abolished EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a firing card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he couldn't waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of reaccepting the boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose seat he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, let me say it nicely, evolving.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the furious Ukip tendencies and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
That's what Hilary said, "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on the radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn't decide to admit that Corby's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all times" - Benn's phrase - apparently not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the report remains important in the ages of all-day television broadcasts and especially in the vortex, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to take the support of the Workers' Party for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corby's fundamental squirming about EU membership - in line with their Bennite besieging economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
Just as with his squirming about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - for Britain's concessions, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the British 'weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when reducing the cost of conservative government in power, as I was reminded of the Monday launch of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise the electronic review published by Public Health England
A statement from the government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, reported by researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency released the "internal" report last month and described it as a "complex review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned data coverage and drew attention to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
The editorial in Lancet last month attacked the "exceptionally flimsy base" on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ questioned the allegations that were allegedly "built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They state that the public could expect the PHE claim to be "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called for the analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report, states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not funding that it allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, supplied.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also claim industrial financing in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report created in this group "promptly admits," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claim in BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifetime smokers dies because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of smoking - related diseases every year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end up with EastEnders, claims former Channel 4 Director
Former Channel 4 Director, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for setting up public service programs that would probably only be followed by a handful of people into difficult broadcasting times compared to its rivals' biggest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After General Manager Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had failed to make contact with the BBC for six years that he worked on Channel 4.
"I fight with the idea that the BBC is entering and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the Communication Commission in the Upper House, as part of the negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you retain licensing fees that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced at least in terms of programs that are not produced or commissioned by others.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, senseless.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty about catching up on ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the most popular BBC shows repeats those that former CEO Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more pampered BBC public service programs "goes to BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission to justify £4bn income from royalties, "But of course we do all these obscure programs that nobody looks at."
They're broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the license fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a big sum, but for people who have £150 a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at the BBC so much.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take as a model public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the topic of partnership Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, which were broadcast on TV by a handful, and contact commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenics" or "brain cell control" using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the nematodes move.
Scientists raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity with light
Scientists have said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day this method could replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are injected into the patient’s brain.
The tubers usually do not respond to ultrasound, but the Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when they are placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves, which then pass through the worm's body.
The amplified ultrasound waves act in the ion channels TRP-4, which is located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are associated with, reports Nature Communications magazine.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then used ultrasound on such modified worms, the sound waves were reinforced by microbubbles and transferred to worms, where modified motor neurons were switched on.
In many ways, the new method resembles optogenetics, a pioneering tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with light.
Chalasani, however, let himself be heard that sonogenics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Khalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
An illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Ads embarrassing the British arms trade.
Watch the video about the Amnesty International anti-weapons market.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg chains that break ankles!
Scattered missiles!
And electric stun batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The happy voice and metaphor caricature leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms trade fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to accentuate the willingness of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security facilities of the International Veselice at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with posters emerging at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Travel to DLR from September 15 to 18?" reads one, using the font with London metro signs with DLR lines becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, the swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are made by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute throughout London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen key, which allegedly "gets access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside galleries.
Many artists move to work with activists within the framework of protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order to have an impact on society.
Another one of the posters against the gun trade health passengers on the subway.
The video Amnesty was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP working without a fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
Creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the gun trade - he saw an empty space in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the creation of a more realistic risky company advertising, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, we have achieved that it attracts more people."
"They did a fantastic job and helped us raise concerns about selling illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we now need is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture facilities are not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army to "on the arm of the AT4CS RS launcher."
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
11 years ago, I moved to college as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I bothered - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorms can move from slightly on the nerves to completely horrifying.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you took a year off, how do you feel about Corbyn, and why "you don't love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract of HAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It runs the conversation and helps you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were releasing fire extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.

Introverts in college come in short.
Your room should be a haven, yet many dormitories are turning into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to see when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write him a place to knock.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a boy in my dorms who used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Because you started going to university on top of the baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and showings with a plate of baked cakes seems slightly less strange than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I'm asking personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and perhaps everything will end up putting your face in a tasty surprise.
Of course, that's the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and toughness are likely to interfere with others pretending to sleep if you try knocking on their door.
Stealing food on campus is a common crime.
Stealing an entire chicken is of course a crime, but is a drop of milk into your tea stealing?
Double-check with the owner of the milk.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're furious inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more maturely than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn the drum and bass down a little bit, because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had a test this morning.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When they finally quieted down at 5:00 in the morning, she let them sleep for two hours and then turned on her own music, locked the door and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic for your future wife to go to the same college as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe she'd take control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you can't tell your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future wife, try to talk to your weaknesses a little bit.
In the uplifting moment when you realize someone left their keys in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never put their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eve was looking forward to twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had had a rough time in her pregnancy with a 7-year-old Vítek today.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I dealt with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the child and looking for positive things in it.
I tried not to worry about the uncertainty and being alone with the baby.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for long, today Eve remembers her first pregnancy.
Already then she met on the Internet at the older Vašek chat, with whom they began to talk about favorite movies.
Vašek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the hospital, but he did not get too involved in the role of stepdad.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in the 3rd.
The motive of the third series of the Czech TV series is the search for happiness on the second try.
Thanks to her part-time work and great help to her mother and help her aunt, she managed to care for Vítek and financial security.
Even the prospect of being responsible for a foreign child did not end up spoiling Vashkov’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítek's second birthday, and he now understands Vašek as his father, and he also addresses him that way.
Although Vasik already has two grown daughters, he enjoys fatherhood at 60, according to his words, and he also devotes himself more to children.
In addition to Vítek, two-year-old Leonty and finally twins joined them.
"Vašek entered our family somehow naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother never talked much into relationships with me," thinks smiley Eva.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
Ema and Ela were born with a C-section after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood pregnant and are mainly manifested by itching.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn fetus, who is at risk of premature birth and death, usually resolves spontaneously in the mother’s postpartum.
Emma and Ela were born healthy with Eve and Vaškov’s happiness, even when they were only 36 weeks old.
Emička was placed in the incubator at the intermediate department, where Vašek's niece works, who managed to take her and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and right after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had her with me, she describes the difficult period after Eve gave birth.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
But waiting to bring in children in Eve’s maternity home was not a joy.
"I was madly homesick for my husband and children," recalls the difficult moments in the department of six weeks four times a mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But this did not happen, and the doctors released Eve and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday night at 9:45 p.m.
Quite a large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with electric two-fences and cramped conditions.
The house did not get bigger, but Vasek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make preparing food for six people more comfortable.
If it's the worst, we'll take turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially the family well-being and pleasant atmosphere, not the size or reluctance of the house.
For now, we've folded very nicely, better than we expected.
Although the mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes overstep the rolling babies, at least we're all close together, smiling Eva, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Vasek's work as a lighter for the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes goes out on the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, according to his words, both family and children physically cope, but how long will that be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, I will one day be the one who feeds this family," admits Eva, asking about the future.
She would like to return to her job, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
I'm not much of an employer with four kids.
And when it's the worst, my husband and I can take turns with a cab, joking like a nice blonde.
Apple hit a yo-yo effect.
It's all the screens.
A more powerful processor, a larger-resolution camera, a stronger chassis or a display that recognizes the power of touch, are in short the advantages of the recently introduced ninth generation iPhones.
The last two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The current trend of Apple was that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous generation.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight slightly increased compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the absence of the news was really negligible.
However, this is far from true of the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight grew by 14 grams in a smaller model, and then by 20 grams in a larger one.
On the one hand, it is no wonder that last year's affair, by bending in Apple's pockets, has greatly bothered.
The new material is thus made of a more durable aluminium alloy of 7000, which was also reflected on the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on her.
Apple used 3D Touch technology for innovations, which makes the displays discern the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be provided with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of displays of new iPhones thus increased more than twice as much compared to previous generations.
In the case of a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest component used.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this news thanks to the fat loss that touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident on the display.
The weight of 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
How practical the new display technology will be when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when sales of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Are the breakfasts of champions tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Paglicci, Italy, archaeologists have succeeded in finding a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by a modern man from different times, including murals, tool residue and so on and so forth.
In a layer of 23A, which according to instruments dating back about 30,000 years ago, scientists discovered but something very similar to the rest of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, there were traces of oat grains found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing today such popular flakes.
With it today, the grains are first drenched, then dried, removed from the cover, so-called pluch, then sprinkled and pressed flat.
In the cave of Paglici it was possible to discover grains that were apparently heated or steamed, and then probably crushed between two millstones - at least there are signs of use on two stones in the cave.
Scientists thus failed to demonstrate in their publication for the magazine PNAS that there was a complete process of making flakes in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and possibly even warm is, of course, very logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes overtook agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station reports at the Brno City Transport Company.
So once again, I listened to the name of the trolleybus stop report: Gross, Specter, Phrase, Bratecký.
Of course, the trolleybus was a little noisy, so the male voice report was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops were reported by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of the traffic is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by passengers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly chose this from studio recordings made in total silence, which of course sounded quite different than in bus engine noise.
I have been living in Brno for several decades, so I know the proper names of all these stops by heart, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners who don't know other places in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and can claim that the stop they were supposed to go to was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer - but better again the announcer - should be done again, and this time it should be painted with normal traffic noise and engine rumble, in which the sneezing of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we don't have to continue to listen to the names of the stations Water Heršpice, Šmírova, or then the Submarine in the creaking shale that I transferred to in Komárov.
I suppose my old man's hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden on the one day that the announcer changed.
Before that day, I understood those reports pretty well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the track record.
Today, few know what the party’s largest and smartest government was called complex checks.
I took the liberty of remembering.
The bus was late.
I crashed into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't run into the comrade chief, came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," said the dispatcher, while I was entering the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Tell me I'm going down the precincts to revise a little mechanization.
I can't do that. Today's background checks.
They're all scared shitless.
What's going on?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time, you will be.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the chief's door opened and the chief appeared.
Tight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of uniform jacket.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran up to the second floor without realizing the cold, sinister tone that the old answered.
"You're playing," said Eva, an elderly lady, whom I greatly appreciated.
She said she was even chief before the comrades deposed her.
They're background checks, and you're just about to arrive.
How many times have I asked what these complex clearances are, but nobody wants to talk about it too much.
They're supposed to be once every three years, they have to be all over them, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
He says I'll see.
I pulled a fascicle out of the drawer with periodic reports and then a phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," said the chief's voice.
What's he bothering?
We just met, and nothing..." I muttered, but no one answered me, each with their own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I've come at your command," I said, "I've entered the chief's office.
The chief sat behind the desk and looked through some papers.
"Comrade mechanizer," he said after a while without raising his head and still carefully looking through the paperwork, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the card on the table, leaned into the back of the chair and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I was insecure.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy commended that in those few months in office I worked very well and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did a very good job of pulling me out of the distance platoon.
And now this?
You realize you're a track distance engineer, and you have to behave accordingly.
The greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stuttered that I had used such a greeting since I was a child, that I was raised so much and that I didn't see anything wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," the oversized chief.
Besides, you're still confusing the calling of superiors.
One day you'll say "sir" and the next time you'll say "comrade."
But I'm not your boss, I'm your comrade chief.
The deputy officers are the comrades of the deputy, the chief linemasters are the comrades of the chief linemasters!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and that honor work, or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your privilege that you're not in the party," said the chief coldly, who calmed down a little.
We'll talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a retirement prepaid chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his privilege, it didn't look good with the guy.
For a while, he stabbed me with a cold, prickly look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also upset about his patronizing name.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing God, actually comrade god.
Genuine, conceited, authoritarian, arrogant, how he's doing at the moment.
He's been blown off by all of them.
So be it, he's the chief.
Actually, not all, the chairman of the party organization called him as all parties, but also non-partisans.
But the chief used to call many, especially those with whom he could assert his superiority.
He just wiped me out for total bullshit.
I thought of something about an ass, and it cost me enough to not shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back on a trek to the pickaxe, let alone continue to be a railroad clerk.
What would I feed two kids on?
And a built-up house!
I was in tears, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna give him that satisfaction.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief shut down the audience and began to re-examine the paperwork he had in his hand.
I was summoned at 11:30.
Everyone from the office was already there, and the questions about what and how, they answered, "Yeah, it's gonna be okay."
Only Jožina bitingly said, as was his custom, that they could not fire us all, because the work would have to be done by comrade chief himself with his faithful ones, and that there was no danger.
The word "comrade" emphasized as if he knew what the old man had wiped me out for this morning.
There was quite a gathering at the chief's office.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long consultative table, other comrades who should have decided on my official being or not being.
Kadrovák, chair of the ROH, personnel clerk, special-purpose clerk, something like a military counter, and deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from a long drive.
An ordinary track worker, scuttling sleepers or pitchforks tossing gravel.
But also a former prison guard.
Rumor has it he wasn't used to have any fun at the time, a pretty beast.
Evil tongues claimed that the school came out in seventh grade, learned nothing, learned nothing.
And when the crime scene was canceled, he ended up on a trek at a pickaxe.
But comrade, yes, the comrade was forged!
The chief instructed me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unspoken pinecone in my throat.
Kadrovák read the opinion from the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
It's okay so far, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then a report from the street organization of the party.
He copied the report from the Civil Committee, perhaps both were written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the screening committee and subsequently spoke out, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief took a hard look at me.
The cadre noticed, and he stopped reading.
The chief told him to keep going.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and that's where I was awarded a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who stepped out, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and besides the National Committee, I had a wedding at the church.
I have failed the party's trust in the worst way possible.
That's why I was removed from her candidate list.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even when my mother died, I sent out a church funeral, even though it was an ex - party member.
By all this, I show a negative attitude toward the party’s leading role.
When the cadre finished reading, only the tapping of the chief's pencil into the tableboard interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wanted to be far away.
I kept saying to myself, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What have I gotten myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could've fixed the switches without some fucking background check.
But now?
Her career as a railway official was taken over before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think so. I'm sure the chief will fire me for an hour.
Comrade, how did you examine this comrade here?" interrupted the tense silence of the chief with a question of cadres.
Well, according to a previous job report.
Do you have it here?
Apparently, the hoodie wasn't two times.
On the crevices of sweat, he stared nervously, as if he had been vetted himself.
He nodded eagerly and handed some paper to the chief.
"Well," said the chief, with a hint of positivity, which often used to be a sign of a storm.
At first glance, all praise, educated with honors, studied industrial science, worked in task wage as a locksmith, fulfilled the standard on average at 120 percent.
But the important thing is missing.
Where did you get that opinion from, comrade?" he turned again to a cretin who felt it was starting to turn against him and that he might not be a cretin very soon.
My comrade here gave it to me on the roll.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct in the platoon," creaked the cadre.
And there's no review required, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So this piece of paper was enough for you when you put it into technical function," said the chief.
The cadre had a nervous wink and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss this later," concluded the chief and apparently relieved the cretin.
He's stuck with it for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden he's calling me out, so that's it!
My eyes were blacked out, I was covered in heat.
There was a flood of remorse and accusations, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world who didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That by planting an incomplete report, I misled comrade credo officer, and I didn't understand why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from the credo man in the factory.
I am also an antisocialist element that promotes and even participates in religious darkness during the time of real socialism.
That, that, there was a lot of things I'd done, or maybe I'd still commit and quietly prayed for it to end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I went out of my way as a mechanic.
I didn't care if they took my pickaxe.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," suddenly the party chairman called and cut off the chief's levities.
The comrade here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did something stupid!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than closing the door to the side for a while!
To be reopened to him, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
An ignorant guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he so read or parroted phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That's why this young comrade has to get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who should give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty that no one can take away from you!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes but also loves.
When the Prime Minister was finished, no one would say a word.
No one expected such a turnaround.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief coldly drew in his attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's the conclusion I was drawing.
Everyone was nodding their heads in agreement, but they showed that they didn't believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a self-responsive reference to the basic means," I shrouded when I returned to the office, and then I cried.
It's a good thing everyone had lunch except for engineer Eva.
She was silently listening to my incoherent depiction of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the cooker and prepared cups.
Meanwhile, she's been talking about cadre practices.
How one assessment, often full of praise, is given to a person, and the other, in which there is dirt, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on a track by the pickaxe, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
All he cares about is where he eats or drinks, and that's how it turned out.
"He'll get it from the old man," she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Keep an eye on him, he's very vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a much worse chief, not a humanitarian.
Zero from a pickaxe with great power.
The coffee water started to boil and the office immediately filled with the smell of just watered coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in a cup and quietly mixed a hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the woods.
Now I'm not getting fired, and there's no more background checks for three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief won't forget my day.
Published in the anthology of LITERATE ON THE TRATI II. in EPIKA publishing house
The symbol of the community has come to life.
The wheel of the pinwheel over Chlum is spinning again after years.
You can see it from afar because it is located on a 50 - foot [15 m] high mast.
People around here call him the "Flum Wind."
For the municipality, 150 inhabitants even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality acquired for the occasion of the birthing event in 2010.
"We applied for a sign then and we wanted to have a fan on the sign of course, everyone knows it in the vicinity," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds of the time when people here were fighting for good drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
In 1910, the Chum representatives decided to deal with the solution, which then suited up to the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch to Čechov, they had a seven - meter - deep well dug.
Three years later, they added a metal structure with a wind pump, which drew water to the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc of Hranice in Moravia with a cost of CZK 2,400," says the commemorative inscription on the ground floor wall of the construction of the mast.
After several repairs and falls of the wind wheel, the pump served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the fight for water began to be written: on that day a new water supply began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and the local rarity.
The dominant was put into operation at this year's native reunion.
It was not until 2008 that Chlumšťi decided to repair the wind wheel again and put it back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced by an average of half a metre.
The wheel was mounted on the mast, but still the same year it had to be brought down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist gusts of wind.
Then the chlum dominant rested under the roof for several years.
However, since June this year, the high mast wheel has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the natives' reunion, the village had the replica of the wheel modified and replanted to the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well only into the ambush of the blind shoulder.
And during the summer, we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the well.
At least it was spinning empty.
"In autumn, the shaft of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction bin will be disconnected again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic, where the wind wheel got into the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole Vysočina.
A similar element in the sign is in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškov, in Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice in Přerov or in the Police in Vsetínsk.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, she admitted the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone else in my career," smiled 34-year-old Goian at a pre-game press conference.
George Hagi coached us back then, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I score a goal for Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we will not lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stoper, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says of the Greek duel Spartan Hybsh.
And he has some idea what he might be expecting Thursday night.
I know Fatai, who played in Astra, Romania, with my brother Lucian.
That's when I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, which is why he also went to Sparta, said Goian.
Another football player did not name the Prague club, so came the direct question whether he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and aimed with a slight reproach at Czech journalists.
The clueless look on his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a while, the silence went off.
We saw some videos, and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience in larger clubs, one can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such their organizer of the game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has been through the best years, but he can boast of a very interesting football resume.
Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steauy headed to Palermo, Italy, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We expect aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European cups, fighting for victory in the Czech league.
He's my favorite in this game, but we're playing at home, and we want to start the band off with a good result.
Just like Sparta we will try to win, said Goian.
I am in the room with Slovak goaltender Tomáš Košický, who is looking forward to a lot of competition from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can tell we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola should have a new headquarters in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to the trading of shares in a company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The actions we have taken so far in the project are mostly legal and administrative and do not have a factual impact on society, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry to the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the prospectus, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related transfer of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or new investors under this operation.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock market in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
A test of the objectivity of Czech TV in information about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time broadcast the main news session of Czech TV.
And how did she stand up?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast of Czech Television Events.
The migrant crisis was devoted to about 80% of the coverage.
Only at the first minute, when the Czech TV informed about the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers called them euphemistically run out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), was the current pro-migrant propaganda - judge for yourself the names of individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Travelling Refugees - CT consistently uses terms of a refugee or a refugee and not a migrant.
What is surprising is that Czech TV uses only and only pictures of small children and women in illustrations.
She herself stated on the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants arrested in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part propaganda that is unprecedented from communist agitations.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once raised myself to a paddy apartment, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
My fishies moved into the umacart toilet.
Domestic fishes, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., do not lose that transformation from caterpillar to beetle and cub looks like an adult individual, just small and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't do anything to kill them.
First by hand and later by chemical.
Socialistic drugstores were providing some sort of blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, they were successfully eliminated.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box of a sort of juvenalizer that the ants brought to their nest, and then he wouldn't allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But that's where I turned.
As time went by, insects became an object of my admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to live as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from my life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
The truth about fleas and bedbugs, I wouldn't be embarrassed to make karma worse by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fishes don't go around our necks, let them eat the chips of fallen skin, some invisible algae, and so on.
Their peaceful existence over time was disrupted by a spider.
He was a common kind of mercenary who had long resided on the ceiling.
We thought he was living off occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he feeds mainly on fish and that their numbers seem to be kept on a bearable number.
By intimate regular contact with each need, we found it to be a female.
For we have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, as he carefully calls on the web’s fibers, so that it will not be eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days for them not to move or react to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried-up male next to the female.
Then the spider wouldn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by a number of small spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother, part of them were scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she'd gone elsewhere or passed away, we don't know, but after a month or two, she appeared on the ceiling again.
That's right, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the toilet-inhabitor.
For some time from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-aggression as friendship.
In turn, the numbers of the somewhat multiplied fishes decreased and the spider was watching his normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed for a year.
In the meantime, our daughter came to an age when the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal spilling of its contents has eaten away.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more strongly.
The daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain her habit in the spider, which she saw very well when wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider didn't take much happiness in the house.
Crying and screaming forced her potty.
There was no need.
The moment came when the spider had to command his daughter in order to evolve.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and thrown over the balcony into the garden.
I said good-bye to him as a friend, but I still felt bad after living together for so long, like I was firing a relative.
We assumed that the fishes would start to appear more often, and they would start multiplying in a geometric series.
I wonder, a week or two, none of them showed up.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider, like ants, had grown them somehow, that the environment of the toilet wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were swarming again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found out that their connection to the spider had to have a reason that if they didn't see him hiding somewhere else and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection to their predator and his rapid disappearance triggered some kind of alarm.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their eyesight.
There was some kind of timid light, but that they would react to the waving of their hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter already goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten the potty.
All that's left is to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish on the air, and I hope they haven't given up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the "B."
Ten statements by Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century may never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to sink so deep into everything that the product was always a staggering discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
His special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportion, has come into the awareness of people.
It can also not be neglected to explain the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity are so complex for many that they prefer to choose easy proportions to get acquainted.
But it is not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: An hour near your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his entire plejad of famous quotes these ten, which literally captivated me.
Smart people try to solve problems, genius tries not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one who can prove that I was wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what he's gonna fight with in World War III, but in the fourth, it's gonna be sticks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous and to know much too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that depended on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive myself for not putting Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are expecting changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four of them have been in black numbers all this year," said President Stanislav Mišák, satisfiedly.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about CZK 32 million.
The main part of this is the higher remuneration from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This fact also shows that, after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, constructions that will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion are coming together.
The long period of time when we've been shopping mainly for machines is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them we can't make top health care, the plans were justified by the Regional Deputy Minister for Health Lubomír Nečas.
They look forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospital next year.
In Vsetín they now select suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
In Kroměříž they have an extension of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new internment for about 200 million to the open central pavilion this year.
And the Bata Hospital in Zlín is waiting for a long-term construction of a new central income and internment, which will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said Věra Prousková, director of the hospital, for example, to build the Vsetín internal hospital.
The five-storey building is supposed to be ready in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
More comfort for patients.
The changes that patients are particularly familiar with will affect all regions.
The new buildings replace those in which, for example, there are many sick people in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are unmountable, the windows are leaky and the medical staff do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the verge of his lifetime," said Pavel Calábek, director of the Hospital in Zlín.
It will therefore be replaced within a few years by a seven-storey modern building connected with an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all the acute wards in one place, plus in new spaces.
The same model is half finished with Uherské Hradiště.
Central income is already standing, and in three years' time, it will be joined by an intern.
"We will pay the construction from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained Petr Sládek, director.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
Profit is still the highest, and it did not reach the loss two years ago, when the Zlin hospital, for example, faced almost 200 million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák said, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients in Kroměříž hospital will also get better.
Within 10 to 15 years, up to half a billion crowns will go into repairs, new equipment and reconstruction.
Already this year will be completed repair of the detention station, then the extension of dialysis, or building a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Czech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that other countries are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
It also points out that no one has explained to him yet how he should keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not get an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text," Chovanec told journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position you have come up with at the EU Interior and Foreign Ministers' meeting?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They're living beings that have visions, they're headed somewhere, they're related.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border control, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas solve everything?
Not long ago, we were dealing with 40 grand, now it's $120,000.
When's it gonna be $500,000?
And how do we keep these people in that area?
Ninety-eight percent of the people crossing us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to join us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who view the Czech Republic as a target country are supposed to come to us, gaining asylum in our country, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees didn't really want to come to us, but we've already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Would it not be possible to accept more of them in this way?
We're committed to hiring 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border control, military operations.
Even with the 1500, the point is that 1,100 people are coming to take care of the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way as the ones we've captured.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe treats this in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
This means that they will come into our territory with a registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet available, it may happen that we will not keep the 1100 in the Czech Republic and they will leave for Germany again upon arrival.
If we can detain them during the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, then almost 98 percent of European statistics show that they gain international protection.
Then they get documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in target countries again.
Then there are 400 people who will move.
This is the second project that has been going on so far, and we have only progressed there by discussing with churches the possibility that they could help them get jobs, housing, and so on.
But that's running on a very long track.
You said the other states were unwilling to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity to unblock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is supposed to be a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can reach them, the report spreads within hours of all the camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migration wave that goes to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to deter those migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Absolutely let them know they don't stand a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovons came to Germany last year alone.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's office.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them according to the needs of the economies, the 50 percent of what social systems are spending on them today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day that Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It's 80 now, the first day was 12.
How far is this going to go to make border controls even tighter?
We were afraid of capture in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we're dealing with.
We still have several hundred seats available in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we hold back will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, it's complicated with Hungary, and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where's the breaking point?
Would it have to be like a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days will drain our capacity to the point where emergency plans will begin.
Then I'm agreed with the Prime Minister to call an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation were to occur, the government could de facto sit down immediately, and by one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police's army, perhaps customs administration or prison service.
The extreme variant is the emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can come to us this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to make this happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarms.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
This would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a lot of her debts at the last minute.
He's trying to prevent a bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid her debts.
Football players got their money.
Football Slavia came to court on Tuesday for the first time.
Almost three months after Online Services from Pacific Samoa submitted a proposal to her about 20 million crowns.
In a matter of hours, attorney Slavia Zuzana Mládek tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it has to be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the previous week was the new owner of Slavia, a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimána.
Apparently, the money came from the new owners at the club at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the Vršovice club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent the debtor tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," said attorney Slavie Mládek.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, the Slovak representative Milan Ivan and Czech midfielder Mari Ličko.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday the club paid the dues of the Prague 10 district.
As part of the insolvency dispute, only claims which are contrary to Slavie are de facto left.
According to the club, the commitments were not made at all, or they were subject to lawsuits.
However, we are prepared to pay the amounts in the event of these disputes being lost.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can document with an account statement," she told Judge Mládek.
"Everything that has been overdue is paid," Mládek said, adding that only unpaid or conflicted liabilities are outstanding.
It is also certain that in the next few days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts.
Subsequently, all evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected at the earliest in November.
The judge ordered the negotiations to continue on November 3rd.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but in writing after it.
A medal for the Finns and the Austrians.

It is this year's news, which premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these honours very much, because they confirm the exceptionalness of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but due to their differences in software and parameter control, FastMig X is one of the world’s top leaders.
The delivery times, which range around three weeks, are also pleasant for those interested.
In the Czech Republic we have already established the first contacts, which will definitely expand after the Brno fair.
We have been regular participants for over 20 years and almost always our business results are better after him than before, Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi shop in Pilsen, points out for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final set is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka was built so she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka was a safer race, says the expert.
The Blanka Tunnel Complex could be built in such a way that there were no two sinks of soil in Stromovka in Prague, claims the production director of the company Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said it on Wednesday night during a press tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It opens to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"Tunel was more safe to go, but the costs were growing exponentially," Butovič said.
According to Stromovka, the conditions were the same all the time, yet the ground fell only a few steps from where it began to run by a safer and more cautious method.
"If these measures were applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovič said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, said the weekly Euro.
The construction was originally intended to cost CZK 17 billion.
Adding to that VAT, which jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one out of 17 billion.
When technology, land purchases, engineering, indexation and similar items are added to this, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37, said Bělohlav
Someone ordered that and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, reduction of fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of year-round profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period last year FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The shares of the company fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx reports that it expects a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey carried out by FactSet.
Despite an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 percent, which will be reflected in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher incomes and growth in online trading.
The Chairman of the Board and CEO of Fred Smith said that the company "represented a firm performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
The holiday charter plans were announced the day after the rival UPS company stated that it was planning to hire between 90,000 and 95,000 additional workers, which is about as much as they were hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, causing revenues in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping boosted the results of FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to higher base rates, while profit fell in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading, FedEx’s shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15 an hour before the opening.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent a year and 17 percent below the record of 11 June.
At its most anticipated meeting over the years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week sitting at the 27-foot Honduran Mahagon table deciding whether after nearly ten years it is time to raise the key interest rate.
Standing over them at one end of the central bank ornament, a two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Chairman of the Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday as to whether the US economy is ready to launch when we stop from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data show a solid economic growth, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could already scare the Fed into adding volatility by increasing its federal fund reference rate - even by no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Blomberg predicted a rate increase this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates only if politicians soften the downturn by promising that there is no further increase.
On Tuesday, the industrial average of Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The meeting was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would hold their rates steady this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed would now raise rates," he says.
If the Fed's politicians did this, "they would have to go to the limit in their programming statement and hold the financial markets in order not to panic."
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it would eliminate uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said that, over the spring and early summer, she expects rates to rise this year, despite complaints from liberals, that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, this year the labour market has seen solid growth.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to what the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of a raise.
And while inflation continues to be below the annual 2% target of the central bank, Fed politicians claim that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to waver at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones’s industrial average dropped by up to 16% below its record value in May, when investors feared that a slowing Chinese economy would bring global growth down.
The market was somewhat reflected this month and Dow is now losing almost 10% of the May peak.
To the Fed’s political players, the precarious situation on the market gives a complex calculus of starting an interest rate increase.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets, and reports of China's economic weakness in the last few weeks, this meeting would have been tightened," said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now it predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about China's latest developments," Oliner said.
The state of health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank’s influence in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint of the then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "sustain" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely linked, Fed leaders can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va, noted this month that "The Fed has a history of exaggerated movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy making, pushed to raise rates, quoted the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage point during three meetings "Despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should give priority to concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Committee setting rates at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil doesn't even come close to this level, he said.
"I'm sure you don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates, because the markets got angry," said Posen, President of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be at the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's Chinatown, not Thaitown.
The market/storage is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and it'll take you over an hour to get through all the alleys.
If you're hungry for all this shopping, go to the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inside store stand (good, cheap) is close to registers and has various sampling points.
What is in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and lots of items are sold in bulk.
The limits of fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, such as fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezing section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, freely selling semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
The wide aisles meet shopping carts and forklifts.
Found: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash counter stand.
Where is it: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Speed on the highways stays the same.
The House rejected the acceleration to 150 km/h.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed allowed to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to do so when it accepted the Senate amendment, which rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Road Act will now head to the President.
By the end of April, President Miloš Zeman said that a law allowing a 50-mile speed would veto.
Minister Dan Ťok (for YES) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such speed.
On Tuesday, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first class roads, especially four-lane roads.
The House first extended this possibility to motorways on which it could be driven in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now accepted his proposal.
Senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed the right of the Transport Police to have the last word in modifying the local roads that the municipalities are taking care of.
The Senate version approved by the House also provides that the sewerage, water supply or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally below the road surface.
The municipalities would have saved up for the purchase of land.
The municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of the vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and facilitate the management of towed vehicles to which owners do not apply.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles which their owners will not sign up for within six months of notification of the tow.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under threat of fines even for forwarding companies.
The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of existing paper stamps, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of the electronic system.
The mouth expressor goes to trial.
He's facing 10 years for overpriced greetings.
The case relates to the allegedly overpriced project "Volunteering of Citizens".
The police also wanted to prosecute the case of Ms Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD), but the Chamber of Deputies did not publish it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both of them are facing up to ten years in prison.
The main trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to prosecutor Mandík and Macík, the damage was at least one million crowns, resulting from the prosecution.
The applicant shall rely on an expert opinion.
According to the prosecutor, former members of the city leadership have illegally allowed the acquisition of the property benefit of the company that organized the welcoming of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the municipal department of municipal services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the selection process.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, City Hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was to be entrusted to the administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges led by the aim of providing Darothore with a public contract for the organisation of the Citizens' Welcome event in Ústí nad Labem in the long term and in a coordinated manner acted at least contrary to the requirement of a proper economic manager's care, writes the prosecutor.
At the same time, they are aware that Darothore will then charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the event The welcoming of the citizens will be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the project file, the company collected more than five million crowns.
In the end, the city paid only one part, approximately CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert's report, the amount paid was at least one million crowns overpriced.
Mandík had previously rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crimes, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this concocted case, the former mayor said earlier that the city under his leadership had only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Roxy II provided the event between 2008 and 2010.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," added Mandík.
Initially, the CSIs wanted to accuse Mrs. Kailová, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it for prosecution.
Criminalists have therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect to accuse Kailová after her parliamentary mandate has ended.
The welcoming of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns to buy children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly released a dog on a fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
According to the Hungarian police on the border with Serbia, the AP cameraman was briefly detained and forced to delete the footage on which the police dog allegedly knocked down a fugitive.
However, the Hungarian Government disputes this accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Police officers intervened against refugees, and one of them had a Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he laid down, says Muzi.
One of the police officers noticed that Muzi was filming everything and wouldn't let him leave.
The journalist was then no longer allowed to telephone his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Muzi's officers took him to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had on tape.
Then he was ordered to delete the footage.
The music thus lost the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt like he was in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP agency sent a protest letter to the spokesman of the Hungarian government, Zoltán Kovács.
She called the behaviour of police officers unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to fear that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács, referring to the police report of Muzi's trial, questioned the events.
He said the cops just wanted the journalist to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark - they are trained to scare and scare a little, but they did not attack with certainty," says Kovács.
Unpredictable Champions League.
The City win will kick our ass. Juventus trusts us.
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserve to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the city coach.
We had more chances, and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team has created many opportunities, but we've had the ball on the kickers longer.
"The cause of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," he evaluated the Pellegrini game, whose team won in the competition after a long 636 minutes.
This finalist of the last season Juventus was on the exact opposite side before each other’s clash – after the first three rounds of the Italian League he has only a point as a champion and with a score of 2:4 is located in the 16th place of the table.
That's why the turnaround at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports before the new year - Pirla, Tevez and Vidala.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manchjuchi and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to it we will hit the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attack phase.
That's what my players deserve.
"Before our balancing goal, we were able to collect at 0:2, but Gianluigi kept us," praised Allegri's coach Buffon.
"We burned some good chances," saddened Yayu Touré, midfielder City.
We need to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Good-bye, Angela, good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media craziness around is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies carrying on their parents' hands after dusty exodus trips.
And this automatically causes guilt and compassion in a person - that is, a European person.
Well, they're not just desperate babies coming here, you see in the footage of boats landing on the Greek islands that the babies don't see so much!
And somehow, we've lost pictures of ships headed for Lampedus, refugees from the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenade thousands of young men lie down.
For the most part, young black people.
And the pictures from Callais have disappeared, where these black men are eating and waiting to see if they can crawl through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's feeling it anymore.
Nor did the images of the primitive Christian Church of Eritreans make a special impression on the people of Europe.
There was too much falseness.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of kept a secret that it's not just unfortunate babies from Syria, it's also hidden - for the elderly: fashionably dressed - young men.
Whose musculatures look like they just came out of some fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lay on a private beach hotel.
No matter how private it was, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no ham.
And the young blacks came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Ages between 15 and 30.
They walked into the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In hands, of course, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they weren't interested, and the workers - Turks, Muslims! - apparently they were afraid of them.
They've taken all the deck chairs.
Whoever wasn't lying on it and was in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like American rapper movies.
On the head cap with nail, white and colored Adidas on the legs.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started feasting.
They took the tables around, stuffed themselves next to the sitting dark and white guests of the bar - read to the Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace in peace.
The incoming blacks drank beer straight from thirds - like in shows from USA?! - on the beach threw empty bottles around.
They kept yelling loudly at each other.
But it wasn't English.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight out of bottles.
They jumped into the hotel swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially those young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, mothers with children and pensioners ran away horrifiedly, and in half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They've all disappeared.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't get it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had about a 20-centimeter massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like jewelry stores.
"Are these drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw them drinking," said the waiter.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what would happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has been shown that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and linked to them by lobbyists and economically important groups, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognised main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, but also the tops of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow television pictures of August 1968.
Of course, there were some sun-sunners at the station, but most importantly - ancient German - Muslims welcomed their tribe members.
For weeks they babbled on the news on Czech TV, as according to some research the Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But who's been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by other information.
For example famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Society of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to hire more refugees a week ago.
That's what our televisions did.
However, they withheld what broke in Germany the next day: that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - 67 000 people participated in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago, that "Our efforts at the multi-culti society have completely failed."
Then she said, "Germany gives up fighting for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to live together like this have completely failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live alongside each other without integrating themselves has failed, and today they live with us, and we have been lying for a while that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
That's not real.
A multicultural approach where we say that we just live happily together, that approach has failed.
He's completely failed.
But I don't think Merkel has the strength to go against powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly increasing.
The Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not even have a diploma in the European Parliament - yes, that is the one that Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play an overseer in a concentration camp from a minute to a minute - has proved himself more than he has.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Let us note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have spent years, at least on the outside, trying to deal with their terrible past of aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil is sown in the soul of Germany by aggression, superiority, and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his strength the attempts of the Grand Germans to control the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When they shut him down, the preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Great Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, is likely to return in another form.
After the Marxists' attempt to rule the state, for example with the Rota Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, for example, on the basis of ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main ideas of Nazism, developed a new German ideology.
We'd say sunshine.
German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving alone all those fighters against the atom, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, silently supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who want to do something different and better all over the world, they have taken a stand for the fighters against heating the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and an anti-Slovak stream treating all Slavs as a difficult vermin - since Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
Also, as the latest statements of Schulz and the German minsters openly threatening the disobedient eastern states show, the idea of a leader in Germany.
Which must be obeyed without rebuttal.
Otherwise, woe be unto you!
And if we add the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is behind this, as always, capital, especially German, which is good for it, which is that Germany actually controls most of Europe's states through banks and the Union.
The sander’s doghouse first led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multi-clturnalism, bringing them home today and perhaps bringing millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by siren voices, are about to hit the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they start to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors again with force, again a part of its inhabitants - but it seems to drive a smaller part of it ideologically crazy, but eventually reality catches up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim dormitory's on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
Whom Muslims have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans embark upon themselves, following the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and even to Germany, when people rise up who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superhuman Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has triggered in Europe the support of the sunshine ideology, i.e. the ideology of elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt behavior against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, it cannot turn out well.
Finishing tomorrow.
Best way to get rid of nosy salesmen: scare them to death.
Just knock and a robust knock will break on you in a way that the weaker nature may not stand.
The revived head will wipe you out and drive you away even hard, accompany you (or rather drive you away) of the persistent seller and the living statue.
Maybe it's too bad you can't get a talking doorknob in reality.
We could use a lot of pussies and shit in here, too.
Red juice (Oxalis corniculata).
A tiny weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it is found among the outdoor tiles near my home.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expansive weeds, but looks like it creates a nice impression of flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's erratic, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, she's easy to adapt, modest and undemanding.
Although it creates leaves with chaotic composition, it is worth watching and taking pictures of.
The beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment is still under consideration.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet while breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Society of SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women knowledge of the importance of a good diet while breast-feeding using images of children sucking from their breasts painted by displaying unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic development of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, although Nine's trying to take the lead on the Today Show
By fleeing Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry to cover costs for the consequences of the liberal leadership leak, it has failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
Nine's morning show projected from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Army has been stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls, and Cancun.
This tyrannical distance to viewers of Aussie TV did not seem to matter so much because it recorded 397 000 viewers in five capital cities on average compared to 330 000 viewers on today.
Today recorded a smaller increase in its evaluation compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was only after last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been filling the Sunrise gap in recent months.
In August, there was an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters by Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand, has on average a very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could tighten the TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night states a clear "yes".
The X Factor from Seven kept a strong 1,136 million viewers, thus smoothly defeating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings of the second night of The Chase Australia.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30) had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the second half of the incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in The Chase Australia ratings from the second night, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a Million Dollar Minute show that couldn't beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final three agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secrets Revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who was going to win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is covered in unsurpassed secrets.
And the three girls who stay standing will certainly not reveal who is the one who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they unwittingly told us who was going to win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's finale.
All three women lyricically sang why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, in the question, "If not, which one gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could work as a conjuncter about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one best suited to Wood in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," said Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're well and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood could make a nice couple.
On her own, she claims that during his last visit home, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls just as much - it's between Snežena and Lana in a tie.
Bachalor's on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest in his transfer to the United States, and a lot of teams were asking about his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a reasonable decision.
Some trainers let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he did to convert the Australian rugbie league in the first pitch kickoff on Tuesday's 20-3 win to Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the pledges in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, said that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his mistake and take care of just another game.
Already during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured swearing when he left the field after the mistake and later said to the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his career in the NFL could not even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goal territory led to the Queensland Three.
Overall, it was a great experience for 27-year-old players.
Hayne posted a photo with fans, where he holds the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin will meet in a discussion on gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on the Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The ÚS stood up for emigrants seeking compensation for property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989 it was impossible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the Act on Extrajudicial Rehabilitation.
The court first gave them the required amount, i.e. more than 2.8 million crowns, but the appeal court changed their claim by granting them only less than 90,000 crowns, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the price rules of 1991.
Emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and were originally charged with the amount sued.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to a complaint against the ÚS.
In the meantime, there was such a change in social and economic circumstances that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - even though it represented compensation adequate in relation to the property being removed - is now only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the expense of the interveners as a restitution of legitimate persons who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation before," explained Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, who explained why the ÚS took the side of the emigrants.
"The ÚS has repeatedly said that the general courts should act in restitution cases so that any inconsistencies are not interpreted against the beneficiaries and that the purpose of the restitution legislation, i.e. the atonement of property injustice caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, should always be achieved," the judge said.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA is now performed by Radka Fišarová.
By the way, Radka Fišarová became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998 she performed the role of Argentine dictator Eva Perónová in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in Prague's Spirál Theatre.
To return to the same role he says: "Today, the demands of Evita did not equal the performance much."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monica Absalom recommended her as Argentina's first lady.
I saw the Monk three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm quite a supporter of more modern modifications, but this one is simply a particularly good one.
"Directed by Ondřej Sokol is original, lightweight and contemporary," Fišarová says.
The imaginary handover of musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monica Absalom's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. in Studio DVA.
The evening will culminate in compositions from the musical Evita.
Experience will surely include a common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In the limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also go to the front desk when he will take part in the role of President Perón during the production of Karel Roden.
Due to the interest of the public, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In directing Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolonová.
At her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of He Peter Strenačik.
The legendary songs of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the Czech texts by Michael Prostějovsky are performed by a live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first performance in the Spirál Theatre.
4 people killed after police shot rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber projectiles into a crowd of protestors against the proposal of a new state constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
There was violence on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu’s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, reports that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, reports.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution and have mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the emergence of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week in Kathmandu, legislators voted on the provisions of the draft Constitution, and officials state that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely can't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of the master Litvínov you couldn't even master a home duel with the hockey players Sparta (3:5).
Aren't you worried about the same catastrophic entry into the extraliga as you were a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.
Honor Mere Folk.
NHC predicts a 60 % probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verdean islands is likely to be 60 percent tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported the US National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verdean Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent probability of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, adding weather forecast based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) reported that it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states in escaping from war-torn and poor countries. Google doubles every amount collected.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoudová published the report on her blog on the basis of her personal experience when she fled Kabul as a seven-year-old.
"We travelled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigrant crisis in Europe, more and more families, like mine, are willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between four non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all posts made via google.com/reflugeelief will double up to $5.5 million.
Europe faces the greatest wave of refugees since World War II, most of which come from Syria, torn by a four-year war, which has driven to 4 million people this year alone.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving nonsurgical treatment.
"The mortality data take a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on a new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey has been conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the height-related weight relationship, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate overweight and people above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastriectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery dropped from 31 to 24,5 at the end of their fifth year, according to a study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent and in part only about 2 percent of patients were completely resolved to compare diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol has been shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," found by authors.
Researchers also monitored the patient’s level of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, reflecting the ongoing blood sugar level in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, reported by researchers.
After surgery, the mean A1c haemoglobin dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group lost more weight compared to the gastricectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reached greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone it is a calming result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a lower BMI group," it states, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after the patient's BMI decline between 27 and 30.
"I think we have waited too long to show people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once they accumulate these genetic changes that connect their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader of Buddhists called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama dealt with the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on a study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He claimed that under the current circumstances mankind’s interest should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable it was, was inadequate in this situation for the refugee crisis.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said.
Although Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria’s efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's lawsuits after 9/11, claiming that "the US's violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in my letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have been ingested by a sanitizer over the last 4 years
Toxicology centres around the United States reported an increase of almost 400-percent since 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years of age who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitizer, according to the toxicological centre in Georgia.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Centre, the number of ingestions in children under the age of 12 reported at poison control centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"The children get to these products more often and unfortunately there are a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink an ambulance deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Youtube videos show teens drinking ambulances for cheap fuss.
The teens reportedly mixed an ambulance with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive scent of the device.
"The children don't think about it harming them," said Lopez.
A lot more attractive (sanitary devices) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitation products with strawberries, grapefruit or oranges are available, which are very tempting for children.
The ambulance contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several sips can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey lie around, either, but people leave these ambulances outside, and when kids get to them, it's a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six - year - old girl who recently ate up to four loaves of a strawberry - scented sanitizer at school and was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered adult drunk, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indistinct words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors were monitoring her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell and hit her head for alcohol, reports Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers the use of non-alcoholic products or to arrange for sanitary devices to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the ambulances were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing an ambulance that contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.
The paramedics thought that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in North New York planned to poison their "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary devices and prohibits their presence in the room.
Police considered the scheme to be "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Rumor: No inconsistencies in the Celtic team
Griffiths bagates rumors of inconsistency in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements of January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons up their lead over Celtice by 5 points.
The first half penalty in ADAMA Rooney's performance provided Aberdeen with a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, giving Dons a five-point lead between himself and Celtice.
Griffiths denies the inconsistency
This situation has sparked rumors of inconsistency in Celtic, which were denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates do not work under any pressure from increased surveillance in preparing for a match with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're feeling pressured. I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Ranger midfielder and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador to Ajax, states: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
Because there are no more Rangers.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the Old Company matches and not just the Scottish people watching these games.
I turn things around, Deila commits.
ROONY DALIA concedes that Celtic is stumbling a little bit, but the Norwegian boss has committed himself to turning things around for the best.
The defeat by Malm and the subsequent fall from the Champions League was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now rises to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has seen bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about what's happening right now.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about January reinforcements.
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he'd already identified some of his January targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the big buyout of reinforcements and insists that he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford says, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
Players who come in the summer have a whole preseason period to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage occurs by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtica Michu's transfer destination suggests retirement
Swansea Michu’s attacker, who was associated with Celtice in the transfer window, indicated that he might retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
A 20-year-old shooter has had trouble with a prone ankle for two years and has not been able to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA for comments against Neilson.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, which was called off.
Neilson stands by his claim and states, "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastleu
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after he admitted to singing a song with lyrics for former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was an emasculated moment," the attacker said and continues: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in Celtic jersey."
The Council of Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in remedying the situation by managing the team at the moment - but admits that the decline on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boy ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCinnes is happy for the "ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately stick against Hamilton Accies in order to win the seventh league win in a row and a five-point lead over Celtice at the top of the table thanks to the penalty of the first half of Adam Rooney.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, without winning this kind of game."
Scotland’s unemployment remains unchanged, while the UK’s overall unemployment rises
EMPLOYMENT in Scotland remains unchanged to 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of UK unemployed increased by 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate was 5.9 percent above the UK rate (5.5%), as shown by the National Statistics Office (ANS) data.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12 000 over a period of three months, with the number of workers now falling to 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland has fallen to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Secretary of the State of Scotland David Mundell said in comment on the latest figures: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scotland's employment has been growing, while unemployment has been falling.
Why I Witnessed the Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will be watching a man be killed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Penitentiary and seeing Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials to witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws near, I'm starting to worry.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of posts for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will be watching the entire execution unbiased.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one and a half hours of visitation.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have put it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help with procedures against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would make him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I'll be watching him die.
I can't say I'm gonna be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die an unnecessary death.
A man escaped Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he rescued the man from the Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrhu to escape the police did not come out after he got into shallow muddy water just metres from a police officer who tried to persuade him to return to shore in a nonviolent way.
The Canning Vale police were called in during an incident crossing Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come and get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't exactly want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use a safer tactic and the police negotiations."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they escape," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning the biathlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the races
Peeter Moody accused the organizer of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to immediately end the race.
He focused on the organizers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive swab for cobalt, which he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Previously, Moody released a bomb in his conversation for racing.com that the department's integrity tried to spy on him.
"Eight months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out about the things that are being done in my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because they've completely failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at that time and are aware of this today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside of coaching positions to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm saying will give them material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really made me sad.
I'm gonna push them, and I'm gonna put a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can walk away.
The frustration levels of the coach increased with long-term investigations for cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratching made him feel like he could "have his license on the table for hours."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on the day of the race "ridiculous" after the horse was applied clay poultice or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his foot.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for tiling treatment on the day of the plant for which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobra driver who ran away was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram this weekend and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by the car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia himself confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with non-stop accidents, non-assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains stable in the hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy strikes back rivals because of wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticized the interventions of his players as "set a plan" by two NRL favorites of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of Sydney Roosters, said that the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team in the Sydney finals on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled comment on Strorm after his team won the finals of qualification over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "show" rugby league and according to him two of Queensland were not "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy defended the interventions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his confidence because his team is criticized by two leading coaches, which may mean they're afraid of losing Team Storm.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed any of our defensive systems and techniques in the last year, and we've just been putting emphasis on contact during the interventions for the past few weeks, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and apparently he's coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how these things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that the Bennet team of St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiere in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right in that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that seems to him to be cancelling, especially his young backups with their speed.
This is the kind of football you would like to play if you had this type of players at your disposal.
He said that in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two reserve guys like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about a fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they were getting to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that more goals were scored in Storm and Roosters than in Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended at 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and failures interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at a certain stage.
Storm has a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.

A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland was bailed out of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilos of Solay yacht drugs that came from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with the accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for owning commercial quality cocaine, Maksimovice argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he could have been in a coffee shop by accident and innocent.
The Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would have escaped.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the trial.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovice jointly offered bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that the USD 200 000 deposit is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Apparently, their efforts themselves were insufficient, for the accused had failed to appear in court, and he had warned.
Maksimovic has been bailed on condition that he surrenders both the Australian and Serbian passports, reports daily to the police and adheres to a curfew from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then applied to her online chat, where he had a lot of naughty photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing her phone and then found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytical computers found the address and discovered "disturbing" searches on the web using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was to "incente pedophiles" on the Internet before he "freaked himself as a police officer and spooked them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson said for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's an addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted he did the computer search, but he claims he was just trying to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them.
He claims he went crazy drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on her phone, he called his mother, shaking and crying.
She saw the immoral pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, has pleaded guilty to bringing an action against children's acceptance or provision of inappropriate images on 14 June last year, violated bail on 25 January and failed to appear in court on 24 March of this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sex offenders because he can argue that there was no "essential sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October to file a social worker report.
Hogg was bailed out in this case, but was held in custody prior to the hearing on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sex offenders before the date of his sentence.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the African oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading up to the stage.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by the statements of opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats of murder, which warned them of the booing of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
President of the MPC, Innocent Gones, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, warning not to defend Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that will not be displayed, but is called 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and that their parliamentary immunity does not work once they step out of Parliament.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has 'fears' regarding threats against Members.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolishing 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the costs of business services of the company.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the business of computers and printers from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in jobs will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and the start will take place in the fourth quarter, says HP in the statement.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditures for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will lead the team after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops to help businesses switch to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual income of over $50 billion and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will be the distribution of the company, founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who manufacture electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was dubbed "Silicon Valley Birthplace."
HP went through a massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized company has better results.
Captain of the Arsenal Mikel Artet says that teammates need to get behind the injured Jack Wilsher before Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger also emphasized for Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason for him not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilsher finished strong last season after an ankle injury and then got back into the former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a career risk," says Wenger.
It's a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be purely medically true, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation carried out by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
In the last five years, he's only played in 65 league games in the Arsenal out of 157:
From a broader perspective for the Arsenal this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but the Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you return after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a contest," says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign at the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb games with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Artet are likely to get on.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe," says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 games after keeping the "undefeated" campaign last season.
On Wednesday night, the stadium shook with an earthquake of 3.2 degrees Richter.
That was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks the Arsenal learned from last season's League of Champions, when he capitulated against Monaco and remained far from hoping to lead the club to its first victory in the European Cup.
"This commitment is enormous," says Wenger.
It never happened to the Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar images in different shows is glaring, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever in terms of suicide among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the only biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) 2015 marked the Year of Man, whose aim is to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing signs of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally sound friends represents half the chance for mental problems to occur.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it must be achievable first.
In this social media communication with emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate answer is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and successful has doubled, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial achievement is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire and game maker recently explained, money really doesn't buy better luck.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this thought.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stems from knowing that, yes, men can also relate to it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."My role as a listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the programs that comes to mind when I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
He emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As far as my assignment is concerned, the condition of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from closer, from a network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend organized by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central Station from start to finish - full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after shooting the goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored his debut at the Champions League and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable win of 2-0 against Malma at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and this PSG player sent French champions after the win, but then they threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualification in elimination rounds, but on improving their trip to the quarterfinals that they recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even though they won three points, it was not a classic performance of the team Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal in front of the goal and later he was replaced against his home team and club in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"The Champions League is not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and look comfortable in defense is a good start, even if there are things we will have to improve with the course of the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury as one of the three PSG team changes, which took home a 2-2 tie this weekend with Bordeaux in League 1, but was overshadowed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing was marked as a man who would move the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transition from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he ran to Marco Verratti's pass to defend Malmo and with a beautiful ending he sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to start a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, joined with 9 internationals in the base lineup and five defensemen and two pulled reservemen were a tough opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjic's shot, which just missed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with bad passes and lousy endings, which was not good even from Ibrahimovice, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was just from his pass when Di Maria sent a spin shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent past the line already sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic passed him after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all of Malma's ideas about the possibility that they could make a profit from the match, and only the excellent intervention of Wiland from a very close distance thwarted David Luiz's hope and the score remained unchanged even when Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was unrecognized at the end of the match.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that the PSGs were one grade higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish League, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches aren't enough.
Hats off for Paris.
It was a wonderful match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion selling shares
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, who was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, made $2.5 billion of stock sales on Wednesday as part of his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with the rebalancing of commodity prices, as China’s slowdown in the economy reduces demand and ignites sparks of destruction across markets.
On Wednesday, the issue of rights sent Glencore stock prices to the top of London's stock market in early-morning stores.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent above.
Glencore revealed last week that a $2.5 billion share sale is part of a broader plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pence per share, which marked 2.4 percent discount on closing price on Tuesday.
So they got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns over the extension of Chinese growth have reduced the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper, and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the US at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing, where he visited in November, the report said.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama are inviting President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
"President Xi's visit represents an opportunity to consolidate relations between the US and China and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the disagreements between both states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several technical leaders of the US on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN September meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address the issues at issue, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber-spionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis swept up the Schengen area.
The emergency flare launched by Germany did not align the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: it will rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they set foot on the old continent - particularly in Greece, rather than argue over the future distribution of refugees by quota on the basis of the quantities that are increasingly distant from reality.
Six days after Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, asked 25 of 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed the priority.
Before caring for the final destination of the refugees, it is necessary to filter out those who are arriving today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for the management of migration," emphasises the text discussed by the ministers on Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its determination and increasing its pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the tide of those seeking asylum in this country.
This makes it clear that without it, there is no free movement in Europe.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday has already served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has done this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permitted under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but he can see blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but toughness is realized.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two thirds of the newcomers were already registered and identified with fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it is more afraid than others that there will be camps left on its shoulders in which refugees accumulate at its expense.
Greece remains the real black hole.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as much as they have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan.
It's a giant gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil, waiting for a new government, has put their hands in their laps.
This is the starting point for the Balkan way and the source of the common concern now for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but it did not mention any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU Interior Ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore about deploying the intervention teams of the Frontex Border Control Agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen island surveillance.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the emergence of genuine European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the .28 has, either way, pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was already put in place by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year, and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in the text approved by most of the 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the trial is suspended.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been reached during the June hectic EU summit, is concluded by Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also a woman who survived as the only one of the affected group of eight.
Previous media reports said it was about Polka.
A 30 - year - old woman was hospitalized in Briancon, with severe leg injuries in the femur area.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly in their 40 ’ s.
"The rescue operation is over, the victims' bodies have also been moved to Briancon," said Pierre Besnard, Prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
Unfortunately, it happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the peak of Mount Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 metres wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, head of rescue.
According to him, an enormous amount of snow was flocking to the eight - man group at about 3,900 meters [3,900 m] high.
Meteorological services today did not warn the area of bad weather.
Trpišovský before the fight with Braga: Finally a true Europe.
During his premiere in the Cups, coach Jindřich Trpišovský managed to pass with the Liberec football players through the European League foreground to the base group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
Slav at the beginning of the main stage of the competition will welcome the finalist from 2011 Braga and according to the coach she wants to impose her game style.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on your way to the dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal we collect, we can play our tactics, and we're not tied up in just a double game.
"I look forward to it very much and it is a true Europe, before it was just a qualification," said Trpišovský at a press conference.
He thinks Braga's the top team.
It will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent might be harder to say that he doesn't have a name like that, but he has three goals in his cadre, I think, for Manchester.
"It is an excellent group at the level of top teams," said Trpišovský.
But he doesn't think Braga's a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from 11 duels of this season only the introductory Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can force Braze's style.
We have a team waiting to be strong on the ball, at the same time it is uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They're playing from 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"He is a very tough opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field," said Trpišovský.
We studied a lot of competitions in the pre-schools, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have adapted to training.
"And we certainly want it to be very difficult to play according to our notes," said the coach.
Student films take over Sand, starting an international festival.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries entered their works in the competition of the 15th International Festival of Student Films in Písek this year.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the finals by the committee of students and educators, will be screened from October 15 to 18 at Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said the spokesperson of the festival Jakub Charvát.
Every year, the festival has a special theme that depends on the festival theme.
It's a detective this year.
The director of this year's gala evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine the elements of television, film and theatre.
"And, of course, we must also solve the crime committed in this year's trailer," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting from student work - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will include, for example, the winner of the last year, the director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers like every year prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turboshanson band Will we fly?, playing band Zrní or for example Petra Hapková with recital Life on the bar.
The festival will host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will be brought by the graduate of the film school in Sísec and the winner of prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition will zoom in on the atmosphere that existed in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and sand natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný will christen their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other and develop joint ties and film crafts," said the spokesperson.
Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, perform several job auditions at the same time, and get a job.
The festival is connected with the creation of the Private Higher Professional School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, the husbands of Vladana and Miloň Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held every two years until the sixth year.
In the event of the bankruptcy of the CK, insurance companies are to pay the client's claims in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
It was decided in the middle of the House when it approved a revised amendment to the Act on the Conditions of Tourism Business.
Travel agents will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee according to the draft, which is heading for the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay client claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adaptation, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against the collapse when the amendment is in effect.
Travel agencies also criticize the proposal.
Without insurance, they'll either have to quit or go abroad.
The Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocomform.
She pointed out this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to full refund regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, emphasized by Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be feasible," Miroslav Kalousek opposed Vice-President TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee won't work because no one gives it unlimited.
"Travel offices will have to stop or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousko's concerns on the basis of a survey between members of the CK.
"Stop showing us the lobbying of insurance companies," he said.
The statement of insurance undertakings does not consider Okamura relevant, there is no official written statement to that effect.
But they say that they will find out whether the travel agencies will take part, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS) also warned against the provision, which referred to the position of the competing Association of Travel Agents of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to arrange insurance.
"Consumer protection works," says Fischer.
The House did not approve its proposal to release the disputed passage.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not go along with the proposal to return the draft to the committee due to an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Philip pointed out travel agencies that he thought might threaten consumers.
Rapporteur Martina Berdychová (ANO) in view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, withdrew her proposal to limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that insurance claims would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum four-million-dollar insurance limit for travel agents offering air travel tours, and a million-dollar limit for offices selling bus tours, for example.
The border will remain on 30 percent of planned sales from the sale of tours.
However, the insurance performance limit will have to be such as to cover all customer claims in the event of a travel agency’s bankruptcy.
Even after the modifications, the standard stipulates that the travel agencies will have to newly mention which travel agency organizes the trip for the tours sold.
Travel agents will have to submit to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, inter alia, information on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information to be provided to insurance companies.
Travel agents will have to supply them monthly information on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of the advance and sales for the tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations towards the insurance undertaking, it shall invite it, in accordance with the draft, to remedy or prohibit it from concluding new contracts in the event that a breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The amendment is also intended to modify the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the mountain service subsidy on the basis of its request, which it will submit by the end of April for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial plan for expenditure and a two-year perspective.
According to the Association of Lawmakers, however, he did not think about the situation of what would happen if the insurance company terminates the contract.
She won't be allowed to organize tours and clients who bought the trip before the insurance was cancelled will lose it, according to the association.
In this case, CK will suffer a significant loss and may fail even though its management was in good shape.
One way travel agents can cope with such a situation will be to sue the State for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then we will only operate on our market as agencies, said Vice-President of the Association Jan Popež.
The draft amendment, in his view, also contains a banking guarantee, but so inexplicably that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound to an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the Association, the change in practice so far is de facto unnecessary.
In the two-year term, the new EU directive will require a revision of the whole law.
On the Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
This year, only three CKs ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell annual tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion.
Merkel: We must improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must ensure that humanitarian conditions are improved in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced this after the negotiations with the German country premieres.
At the same time, it once again appealed to the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU among the EU's 28 Member States.
We must help more in the countries from which the refugees are leaving, or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will set out for decent conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, that this signal could also signal greater financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"The joint countries also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, Earth Prime Minister of Brandenburg Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke also voted to speed up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start the integration of foreigners faster, said the Prime Minister of Brandenburg.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees also needs to be used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
It's gonna take more teachers to get the refugees to handle German.
This is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees are able to integrate, they can become an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon Bagates Diversity in the Movie
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during the discussion of diversity with the claim that it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO project, Greenlight interrupted the actor cast in the Brown series, emphasizing the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
“Speaking of diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not by casting a show,” says Damon.
Shocked, angry Brown reacted with mistrust and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the Martian comments got on the air.
Damon and Brown joined the joint producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will treat Harmony in character," said Brown at the beginning.
The only black person who's a hooker who's being picked up by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off that their director "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the debate was broadcast, social media exploded in disarray with Damon's commentary.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing a clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the talk of a single black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is white enough to hurt."
Tweet has won over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took a national effect and pushed law and authority makers to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made references to the movement while presenting the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Alba are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the question of personality Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the leaders.
Damon was recently reported on a list of entertainers, producers, and mogul media invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the finals of this season, two men fought their way through to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated first in the set limit and became the first contestant to overcome the debilitating 4 section in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for newsE! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was obvious that he was still in shock from winning the $1 million prize.
“It’s a wonderful feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” said Isaac E! in response to his winnings.
"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed interviewed The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten won no reward despite becoming the first contestant to complete the course.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the person who completes the track the fastest.
"If more contestants participate in the course, the winner will be the one with the best time," Weed said.
Although winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don’t think he has a grudge.
He's glad he's managed to achieve what he's done.
He got a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me: “If there was anyone who could beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac. ”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will start filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers passed just past Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season was not exactly a walk in the pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is now in the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers had just turned away their defeat when they beat Minnessota with a close result of 5-4 at Target Field Stadium on Tuesday.
The twins missed their chance to approach the Houston Astros team and seize the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which for them during the second half of the season was so elusive.
"Winning is always fun and it doesn't matter how," said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive entrance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took the next one in the sixth and ninth inning.
Simon (13-9) allowed his opponent 6 1/3 hits and 3 rounds.
It was only his third great game from the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a game when you're on a bench often and that's why I want to get in the game."
Tiger batter Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 rounds and his first downloaded point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, in which he scored four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned on it nicely," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at practice, batted significantly better and managed to transfer it to the game."
Thanks to three orbits at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins had the best chance of getting back in the game.
Central Pole Byron Buxton got a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Real Pole Aaron Hicks scored a point with a set bat, and Simon took out Brian Dozier before left-handed Blaine Hardy replaced him.
Hardy took out his only rival Mauer, and he had Miguel San's batter in front of him, who hit the ball and ran two bases and left Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the bases and a chance of a draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send a third meta through two bases.
Plouffe has already won 27 circulation over two bases this season and is king of the league table.
Detroit kept his ninth shift, Mauer scored two points, and Bruce Rondon scored 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed guy knocked San out on three pitches.
Detroit took advantage and won points in Phil Hughes.
Tigers gained three rounds in the first two shifts against a retired right-handed man who entered the game after more than a month's pause due to back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly did not imagine such a start," said Hughes, "but during the third shift I felt that I was doing better."
After resisting the first shift, Hughes released one point at a time to another to Ian Kinsler's meta.
Two exits for J.D. Martinez's right-fielder brought out Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the bases.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was thrown when he tried to run to third base.
Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and Pole Anthony Gose got them two and then one point and the score was 3-0 on the final board.
"That's what got us on our knees," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he put him in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, ended up in the third inning with no points and replaced him right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, got six hits and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, a real Tiger pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez' shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the list of injured due to the strained muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should start in the Wednesday game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and move against the Twins.
Since the 30th of June, when Norris was traded for David Price's left pitcher, he's scored 1-1 after 4 games.
Since August 20th, however, he has not played because of the pulled muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is the Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening up of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to a wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping to a group whose task is to reform management on Tuesday.
"China should be involved in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," he said on the 16th session of the Central Head of the Group to deepen the overall reform.
Promotion of opening up in emerging reforms will give new impetus and vitality, also providing new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policy, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registered resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, stating the statement.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure that companies themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are funded from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement states.
Moreover, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card" by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
A new bed department may be established in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Důšek (ČSSD), the current capacity of bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
In the region, however, there are also possibilities to extend care.
For example, the surgical department could develop a one-day surgery centre where surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed according to the established concept.
It is not yet clear in which specific hospitals the one-day surgery workplace should be in.
A laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases could be developed at the skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital.
The concept also recommended the emergence of an apalic center that would take care of patients with brain problems who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentration of such facilities to the island hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, is the subsequent care beds, in particular the beds of Léčeben long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely linked to acute care beds.
Part of this device should function as beds rehabilitation and part as classic LDN beds, recommends conception.
As he points out, the beds of follow-up care are mainly missing in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There you could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least in the Karlovy Vary Region, social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are absent.
These beds are scarce throughout the Republic, so they could also serve for other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's Center.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called successive beds, for which European funding will be released.
"These are beds that will be linked to the areas of supespecialized care and will create room for translation of patients after surgery, e.g. after cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," the regional concept describes.
New services could also be offered in the area of psychiatric care.
