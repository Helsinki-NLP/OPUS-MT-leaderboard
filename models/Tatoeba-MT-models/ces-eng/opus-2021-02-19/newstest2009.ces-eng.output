At the end of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus
After a sharp collapse in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
CEZ shares transactions reached almost half of the day-to-day business.
From the beginning of Tuesday’s trade, the Prague Stock Exchange followed its decline on Monday when it fell by almost 6 percent.
This time, the stock drop on Wall Street is behind the drop.
Here too, the market's response to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Stock crash in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday was experienced by stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Exchange Index in Hong Kong has written off almost four percent during trade, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock on the Hong Kong stock market, has fallen by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets have been closed.
Sydney’s stock market lost more than five percent, but in the end, losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock market, according to its index, has fallen by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the rescue in the US is uncertain and will affect the financial markets around the world," commented Chief of Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy separately, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, it is said that other countries will feel the effects.
American Stock Blood Bath
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected a plan of support for the financial system, for which up to $700 billion was to be spent (almost CZK 12 trillion).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost seven percent and recorded a drop of similar magnitude last time in 1987.
The index was falling before the vote, but once it became clear that the proposal had failed in the House, the index was in free fall.
Congress retreated: The US government can pump $700 billion into banks
US Congress leaders and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
The vote on it will be the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in talks about approving a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately CZK 12 trillion).
But the game has not yet been won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final draft of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the Barney Frank House told Reuters.
According to sources, the Senate could probably vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, we will get sober thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We have solved our differences about what the form of the market stabilisation package should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers' representatives met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which are pulling financial firms into heavy losses and threatening the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue the recovery plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is affecting stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's democratic senator Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their best to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress’ decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear for certain when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, nor whether last-minute negotiations can be stuck on a problem.
Lawmakers hope to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still make a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program does not perform its function, in the sequence of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations
While the President may veto this decision, Congress may overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of a program that was to raise funds to buy out bad mortgage securities whose value had fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, remained.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitations on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the money program, protection of taxpayers from losses, closure of concessions, timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called gold parachutes for directors of the company participating in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
That should be run by the Treasury.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments for mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly repayment costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to the chief economist Patrio Finance David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that is because it is not known what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets will be redeemed.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will divide their losses," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, Mark says it's not that important.
"It is much more important that this week the Congressmen agree to support this plan and to sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is most important at the moment," Mark emphasized.
Knife blade fight: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll advise on how to choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
From that it seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to buy a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the demands of the future owner.
It's hard to get home a top-notch expensive record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on LP boards and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you are distressed by art rock, jazz or blues on your vinyl shelves, you will probably dream of at least such a gramophone.
It is the same with music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend $8,000 on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it hard to bite the headphones for 20 crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Batteries are also determined by battery endurance
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most cell phones can't do.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
Besides primary functions, phone calls and texting, he can play music and video, record both, have a better one, the worse one, and maybe he can navigate.
And considering the smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of a cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than 10 12 hours, usually much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap phones, therefore, expect that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you make any more calls here and there, get another charger to work just to be sure - that's also true for more expensive machines.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem arises when you record music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but few card readers can handle miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
You do not need any special software for players except for exceptions (iPod).
All you have to do is fill the device with USB music from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library by name of the artist, album name, genre or user evaluation.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories similar to the Windows Explorer and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can do more
When selecting a particular device, be particularly interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and of course also the comfort of control.
If music is primarily a set and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram, you just need any cell phone that plays MP3.
Which almost any cell phone can do.
You don't even have to watch too much of what music formats a cell phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and besides it, the vast majority of instruments can also handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit the respective website of the operator (or another provider) via the mobile Internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already in itself be a strong argument for the acquisition of a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to fast-fermented radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this method of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones around all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening, you feel the phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it depends whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every cell phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones are normally under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll already have a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to common headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped phones with 3.5 mm holes for common headphones cost up to 15,000.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy to operate.
The simplest ones - not necessarily the cheapest ones (see our selection) - players can really control everyone.
Minimum functions, similarity of control with a previously common tape recorder or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile Internet and then a huge data transfer account.
What devices to reach for
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card you can fit into 2,000 crowns.
Be careful, though.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 CZK.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners reach for specialized cell phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
The latest is in Sony Ericsson, whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as individually sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand CZK, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours), will take MP3 players away from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services such as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet there's something missing here - a virtual operator who would make the classics cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written on Mobil.cz many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
After all, CTÚ confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation may occur - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding up so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrations over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to play on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with his own network probably no longer has much chance (after all, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant price reductions, to which even classical operators had to respond.
Even before the entry of pikes such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market, similar voices were heard in the UK as in our country.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to concentrate on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on a fresh target group can be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Administrative men vote Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a concept like that in Poland could follow us.
Vodafone's press spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations do not look very promising in the Czech Republic.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, Spokeswoman of the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to avoid any potential competitor.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden for a long time by the GTS Novera Group, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in the negotiations with some of them," says the group press spokesperson Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's a good time, then.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be waiting maybe until the end of the year.
For now, however, its emergence is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any subject with a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň, of the O2 Telefónika Press Department, told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, press spokesperson for T-Mobile, adds in rare agreement with O2: "We have not yet noticed any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it's hard to find a virtual operator.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to consider it in this short term."
Vodafone is paying attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider most beneficial from a customer's point of view.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - one hand with operators
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would increase competition, would lead to a fall in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when operators want something, they can pull together is also evidenced by the movements around the creation of U:fona.
Probably the biggest pressure towards CTÚ went at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
Now, however, U:fon is useful as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would impose high requirements on him and, above all, on his services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, it is directly striking by the total lack of interest of Czech regulators.
This is not just about the CTÚ's position, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stand on the issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator to rent the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," Kristián said in response to our inquiry from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
It may not surprise the representatives of the operators to hear such a statement.
From an office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market, it is more than considered.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators operate normally, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not one of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In fact, the whole case is shocking to see the touching alignment of three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if it's really just a coincidence, offers itself entirely.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is certainly just a result of chance and a hard competitive struggle.
"The Authority did not find signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore has a corresponding increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are probably missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
Interpreting a dominant position on the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - it is always necessary to agree with the network operator to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are doing similarly.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
The imposition of responsibility on the Czech Technical University is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, which the ÚOHS takes away from the whole matter.
We've met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunication Act, the CTÚ's powers to compete in telecommunications failed to be extended, although many experts had promised to improve the situation.
This must be known more than well by representatives of the ÚOHS, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's okay when no one's watching.
However, the operation of pseudovirtual operators, several of which exist in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies issuing their own mobile phone prices, but they are only partially public.
They are usually multilevel marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The prices of these companies usually come only to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company performs against the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer then gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar sales.
"If there are cases you are talking about, this could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová answered.
However, it is unlikely that a similar activity would not have taken place with responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators shall be prevented from doing so.
In fact, the activities of these companies have considerable profits, and they do not - unlike real virtual operators - endanger them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law of such speculation allows, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot have it fully with them as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that's what the CTU should be at least weird.
In addition, there is another question for the OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to similar procedures, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the OOHS has relatively strong powers to detect similar activities, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the operators’ explanation that they have no idea of such activities and their business conditions prohibit it.
When We Will Not Be Most Precious
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decline in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were formed, classical operators tried to prevent their creation more or less.
Their arguments used were practically identical - too small, or too saturated market, problems with quality of services etc.
In developed countries, however, regulatory authorities, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers, have intervened at these very times.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and they were packing more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are turning the case around like a hot potato.
From our experience, we can't shake the impression that the ambiguity in competences is more than useful to them in these cases.
But let's not throw a gun in the rye.
If back-up information is correct and the virtual operator really appears soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will hardly be possible for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling harder than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of Czech State Day festively presented new recordings of the national anthem Where my home was.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávka.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took part in the singing.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Whitehead considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymens.
He had already told the Czech Radio that he deliberately chose singers with young representative voices that are distinctive and popular to sing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to be careful with both of them and then with the congregation so that they could have a clear diction, so that the text could be well understood, so that they could be reconciled," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home sounded for the first time on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her for their own.
The first verse of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem sounds like
Prague public transport for the first time on a chip on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and bus station, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, it can buy roughly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will apply from 1 January 2009) and also have their chip card uploaded at the infocentres and workplaces of the Transport Enterprise in the metro stations Muzeum, Mustek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
Over 400 customers used the service until afternoon hours.
Those who start using the online shop can definitely forget about the window at the metro stations, where they have had to stand regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
The coupon buys over the internet and is uploaded to the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these places there is a counter with a trained service that will help those interested in buying online and also upload a purchased coupon to their card," said the spokesperson for the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service slot machines, which are installed in several metro vestibules.
What do automata look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket marks, and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," he added.
Coupon checks the driver's seat slot
The vending machines that start working tomorrow are simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip into it and the previously paid coupon will upload itself to it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
Thus on suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which are used in the capital mainly by the inhabitants of Central Bohemia.
"On trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, conductors are equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of coupons," Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid explained.
The suburban buses have card readers built into the ticket office of the driver.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver, but it is also necessary to attach Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will check the validity of recorded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and do not remember when their coupon expires can go back to self-service slot machines where coupons are recorded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the instrument display.
The Sudetenland wanted a referendum from the US
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans requested the inclusion of Sumava with the United States.
It comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America at least.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is due, among other things, to a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter from the American President not to allow the "Shumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to return to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that American troops come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, signed by the words "People to whom the fate of the Shumava lies."
Since joining Czechoslovakia allegedly gives Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of a letter from the US President to take over the Protectorate for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would not admit this territory to a foreign country, which oppresses and disproves minorities and nothing, without contributing to the victory of the Allies," says the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign is said to be concerned about the vindictiveness of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the US allegedly doubted the thinking of the Shuvai Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Shuvai County on whether its people wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of postwar history, according to some of the witnesses it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that this would be about their removal from the Republic, few of them ever admitted such an option.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate with the Sudetenland some kind of autonomy.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, he was like a Budejovice German stationed with the Navy on the Baltic.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holstýnsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they got home, they could use Czech," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected to be removed from the republic on the basis of Beneš' decrees.
You don't mean you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Still, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček's office promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to buckle up before they leave.
He wants to touch his conscience mainly with young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, with professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the "bloody" slogan of the campaign is all about:
You don't mean you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And then in a pool of blood, the word "pay" is "pay."
This is to symbolize that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one’s own life.
Audiences will be "frightened" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic pictures of victims of accidents are commonly seen.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for the driver
"The system of carrots and whips applies to drivers.
For them, sugar is that, for example, when they run a red light, it saves time.
A whip is a threat to a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist at the hospital in Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, it means psychologist.
According to him, boards that alert the driver to danger are less effective.
"If a static board warning against danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surrounding area and drivers will not attend to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the interim Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordánska, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give Palestinians a similar percentage (the land of Israel), because there will be no peace without it," he said.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked in a reference to two July attacks in the city, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places" that lies within the Old Town.
"Anyone who wants to keep Israel's sovereignty above the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That will not work," he emphasized.
Leaving Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s departure from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the departure from Golan," he pointed out.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shia movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support provided by the terrorist (the Shia movement) Hamas, (the terrorist networks) Al-Qaeda and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law doesn't know them. You can't walk on a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus from Student Agency near Padova, Italy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers can move on the bus while travelling.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Apparently, the accident that killed a 22 - year - old stewardess last week was caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, at that moment, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role plays whether the bus according to the technical licence is equipped with standing space.
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger must sit down.
Long-distance buses Student Agency do not have standing spaces; this has been confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I discussed and at first did not allow passengers to move.
We subsequently called it off, and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the bathroom while driving if they have their seats," he said.
The law of the steward doesn't know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," Hanzelka said.
On the contrary, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the issue of the law is being treated sufficiently.
"It depends whether the bus is allowed to stand in homologation.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where standing spaces and limited maximum speed are located, long-distance and high-speed and long-distance seats are fitted with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
Expert BESIP on traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a major problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"When driving smoothly, there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
Even here it's not certain when the turbulence comes and the stewardess can hit her head."
"However, if the bus brakes sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be dealt with by the carrier by internal regulations," he says, and he also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
The Agency student offers Stevard services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"As soon as I get the impression that the company's profession is risky, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on arrival.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in security, Director Alexej Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his vehicles.
"We don't have stewards, we've been up against this since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end in some fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Výden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Happened
In an accident of the linkage to Naples, a young steward from Pilsen died, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck probably swerved without using the rudder from the stall lane and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid a rapid maneuver, but he hit the right front.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold out, Jančura refused.
"It is not possible to book these places for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company's going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ortel, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A law amendment?
Out of sight
Specification of the movement of the stewards on board the bus could bring an amendment to the law, which has been worked over the year by a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, she did not come to any specific conclusion.
Buses don't even solve much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile while driving," says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be a major threat to the safety of passengers," says Hanzelka, a spokesman, adding that the safety of buses is under the responsibility of the police and labour security authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The large words in the letter from the Board of Directors of WestLB to the employees of this bank are not missing.
By joining the units of this Dusseldorf monetary institution with the French Deka-Bank, the "central institution of the financial group of savings banks for the trading of capital markets" will be created, we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring in the "competence package" providing long-term returns in this transaction.
And it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further association in the Landesbanks sector.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act during a problematic period.
Unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which savings customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, at the presentation of the six-month management results at the end of August, heard that he did not see the point in the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with any of the Land banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, for which it stands from one half of the Landesbank and the other from the savings banks, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct interviews with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about capital market transactions or some of them.
But the talks have only just begun, and financiers are touching.
Deka-Bank, who is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, the merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba seemed to take place.
In the end, nothing came of this three-group.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Helene Land Government opposed Helaba’s participation.
Both of the other banks didn't connect that way.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead received Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite this, speculation has repeatedly emerged about Deka-Bank's connection with the Landesbanks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, has expressed himself negatively about speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
It seems, however, that independently, it matures the belief that the convergence of various public sector banking houses is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Land Assembly in Bavaria, BayernLB’s connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to begin.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, it gradually loses potential partners for such mergers.
In the south, she would only play second violin, even though the financial crisis still faces much better than bank houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year the merger with WestLB prohibited the Hessen-Thüringen savings banks association, which has an 85 % stake in Helaba.
Nord LB would be considered as such at most.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are, however, only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much they match the business models of individual institutions.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question as to which business model the future competitiveness of Landesbanks should be ensured, had not yet been answered by the German savings and giro banks association.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, nobody wants in this institution.
That is why the letter from the Board of Directors also mentions that it seeks a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect to the connection of individual folders with Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the weekend with the Italians.
It's the first time for Elena, for Luca, for the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so she says everything will be different, she says.
Behind them, in the five-litre cask of Kaiser, is a stronger beard, and 200 tourists on Oktoberfest prove how deep his throat can deliver.
Elena will slap Luca first and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
The three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, on one bus are exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
Marc, who is wearing a long coat with a lining made of imitation fur and glasses with wide silver frames, belongs to the three buses.
He has been riding with them to Oktoberfest for five years, only this year he organizes three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10.30 p.m., leaving back.
Overnight would only cost unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcoming toast to Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave for the night, after the car show in the direction of Brennero.
Beer's not served, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers are asleep.
Good for them. They'll need their powers.
They stop in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where they take one more break on Highway 8 in front of Munich and many other buses with Italian plates.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's last speech explains the plan of attack.
One, put your yellow hat on.
It says "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to Marco's travel agency's internet address: "conoscersiviaggigando.it".
Two: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and fill the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so that you do not interfere, and not all yellow caps on the same bench, spread around the space!"
It costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the paramedics that we're good manners.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Three: "Be back here at 10:30 sharp tonight!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, beer tent space.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats like signs on trees, signs and even an election poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare to retreat.
The weekend with the Italians is the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Accurate figures on the numbers of visitors are not available; 50,000 of those who travel through the Alps and fall into beer tents are said to have arrived ten percent of all visitors this weekend from Italy.
A series of Munich police will strengthen seven policemen from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics in which Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments.
The tent Hofbräu is especially popular with the Italians.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
Until last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück pointed out that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is a good thing that this politician used the word 'relatively' and also interfered with the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis development.
Because that's what happened last weekend.
With the Dax index, a controlled financial house specializing in real estate financing, Hypo Real Estate (HRE), will receive a loan of several billion from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the loan aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from a truly exhausted amount.
They say the money comes from private and public banks.
The losses of Depfa’s subsidiary are in the background.
This state financier, according to a newspaper report, has been extremely short-term refinanced for long-term projects for which he lent money, which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrunk by 95% to EUR 2.37 million and slightly decreased its equity share from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, yields from the increased value of claims and from certain securities and also from the abolition of credit trading reserves fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenue from compensation for the subsequent settlement costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the interest compensation under the tax rules and for brokering trade for the group companies, the 16 % decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on mortgages for businessmen, which were then earmarked from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
As there was too little money in the classic state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
Hypo Real Estate must now write something off from the value of its subsidiary, and these write-offs will have a "essential material effect" on the calculation of profits and losses of the entire group, as some have let themselves be heard vaguely.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
It has already been cut by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depfa.
More strongly than any other institution depends on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up because banks are safeguarding liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for part of Depfa's loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion a year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this loan for the foreseeable period of time and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently largely incompetent functions".
Other sources have been heard that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets anytime soon.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now assured.
This is what shareholders and bank creditors hope.
But with regard to the dynamics and incompatibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not entirely excluded that the loan does not need to be fully exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank apparently faced insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, though preliminary, the rescue cannot calm the passions.
The stock rate fell 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, they were good at holding bond classes.
While preferential debts have virtually not moved, they are losing secondary bond courses more significantly.
This concerns mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically the bonds with maturity after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the emission banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their due date.
But there may also be what almost no one dares hope for at present - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, given the reports coming along with this partial nationalization, the probability bordering with certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This will likely prepare a number of sleepless nights, especially for long-term creditors, when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the marginal line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous financial years to foreign exchange income of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital income tax.
Sylvana and the secret box bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to introduce herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start to piss: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows that word from mang, and on her new blog, she talks about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was scared of going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way. Luckily, I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after 8 o'clock and 20 minutes before 9 a.m. a short meeting with a teacher, called 'home room', begins.
But before class started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students in front of class.
Since I haven't worn my school uniform yet, I wore my host mom's old skirt, my blouse, my blue socks, and my black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajónara Wo Še Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is next week.
At that point, I was so glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawai'.
I knew that from my mangoes.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly set sail to my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite wide, she thought it was an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong came out, they literally filled me up.
They spoke across each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and impossible - and yet it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all unpacked their blinds.
My host mom also made me this lunch box - and that's different than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu batter.
I don't usually know exactly what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, except for the bacon-loaded plums, I guess!
Benta at Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a kid a bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes to get to know a boy at a snack break.
That's what I read about in my mango comic books.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I've liked to read mangoes for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning a little Japanese once.
It was clear to me, then, that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a thing for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach escapes danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that even many animals have feelings.
But how could they be verified if they feel the same way when they behave like we do?
For several years, the Internet magazine "Edge" has published contributions from well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in her series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you consider true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we begin to engage in a different kind and open up perception or general consciousness, we enter an impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, he does what many other animals do: he pretends to be dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave similarly, some scientists conclude that there is a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal life.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include side prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could conceal the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if language consciousness did not matter, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, however designed, would probably differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to figure out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure even, because of special hardware, to analyze it on the basis of our own experience, we are faced with great problems.
Most of my outlets relate to the content of conscious experience, but besides that, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more accessible.
It would be possible to examine animal consciousness processes regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in visualization.
But this approach by Christof Koch and Francis Crick focuses on neural correlations of consciousness rather than on causal mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I conclude that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves, when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
Seen from this angle, the feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex, which are characterized by primates, and especially by humans.
In connection with language nature, there is a subtle degree of perception, because using words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states to attribute them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and the brain stem devoted to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in feelings perceived by several animal families.
In theory, I cannot resist this, but I find it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems like fear to us in rats and humans probably feels the same way: But how can it be verified, does Pankseep also say whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the congruency of experience.
True, the neural comparison pushes us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can look forward to progress on the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Just like I don't study the language and consciousness of rats, I don't explore the feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: A time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"It is not amnesty for our country.
Work has only just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the early fulfillment of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are limping.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will fall from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said Grigory Surkis, Chairman of the Ukrainian Union.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
Following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the leadership of the Polish PZPN Union was dismissed and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecký.
It is said that there is "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish press agency PAP.
"President UEFA Michel Platini has been assured by letter that he will not suffer the preparation for ME 2012 by this step."
Several teams from the First League were only sentenced to forced descent last season due to manipulations, eventually had to be moved to the start of the League in haste.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to advertise a new movie, talk about private matters, and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He's furious and strikes back.
Late Rose War with former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having a nasty dispute - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, commented on the reasons for her marriage's collapse: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she didn't know the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The impulse for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: He is "crazy," said the 55-year-old actor of the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
Moreover, it is "politic" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce each child."
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
He ends up thinking about cheating like this: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have an amazing family that's doing great."
Flight and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have again decreased - this is the result of a study of the provider of American Express travel and financial services.
The company analysed its data on reservations made from the first half of 2008 and after the price rise in the first quarter found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market grew for several years, accommodation in many places has already reduced.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most subtle was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express considers this trend to be the cause of a weak dollar exchange rate that has caused the "declining taste of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices was also more severe affected by financial centres than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have even recorded a European record with an increase of 26.3%.
Also, ticket prices showed an even higher trend in the first quarter:
Because of the cost of kerosin, Economists had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, even 29.2 percent more than in 2007.
From April to June, the prices of tickets in the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but changes in Business and First-Class classes were much less pronounced.
In Germany prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study cited, prices fell by half.
One reason for this price fall is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, because of the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit lines by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods Hamburger SV gets to the head of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay no longer manages to assemble a working 11.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player got into the game too late and failed with the ball on the stick.
His report was precisely formulated and came out of his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the corridor to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the break between halftimes ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been HSV physical therapist for almost three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
So his request was also answered in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol came in and raised his thumb as a sign of a match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His orders were probably similar: here with the second goal!
It didn't happen.
"It wasn't looking at everything nice today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it more relaxed.
1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgers owe the head to Mladen Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbashians could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up Martin Jol.
This Monday Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated video screen in which their team was listed as a premier.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the ongoing table result symbolizes the incalculability of the League rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Nevese and Silva, goaltender Petrić and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but cannot shine yet.
"We need more feeling and more dribble," Jol said.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports on the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow put on some weight.
Around 20.30 this world's most important stock exchange barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The technological exchange Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in the minus at 1548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this point the American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' stock lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett, a major investor, had a stake in this company.
Under the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the whole amount should not be paid at the same time, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive stock options from financial companies that could be reimbursed in favourable exchange rate developments, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Share rates in Europe are falling sharply
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not rid investors of doubt.
The share rate of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly descending and withdraws the Dax index.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing the state despite the planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular currency losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have torn the German share index (Dax) deep to the negative.
Despite the rescue action of the Federal Government and private banks, up to three quarters of its value, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent recorded 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York City, business day on Wall Street began with major losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion bailout package by the US government might not be enough to revive financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points during the first trading hours, or 3.3 percent, and is about 10 809,25 points.
The American House of Representatives is to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could comment on October 1.
The other European markets were also moving in only one direction: in London the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell by 1.26% to 11,743.61 units after initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18 286,90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506,43 points, or 3.9 percent, and the trade ended at 12,595,75.
In MDax, after the announcement of an increase in the core capital, Arcandor's shares were lost.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourist group announced that it would not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have not been able to cope with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, are now threatening to die of cold.
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists for years - an anomaly of the gravitational slingshot.
The gravity slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they acquire additional momentum in the gravitational field of some cosmic body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses sun probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case in wonder: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, irregularities occur at speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was christened by an anomaly of a gravitational slingshot.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and he tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using so-called dark matter, the presence of which astronomers have discovered in the universe.
"The answer for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space explorers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It's obviously derived from a gravitational force whose effect on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she herself is completely invisible, which means that she does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not just visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the announcement of the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, kidnapped tourists are again at large.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in a pre-release shootout.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
They say the ransom negotiations are underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become targets of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists dragged into the Sahara seem to be free.
It was reported by the same Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija, and the Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were liberated.
We are currently verifying their state of health," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He said, "It was just about taking over the hostages," when all of a sudden, "this surprise."
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
With reference to one of the German intermediaries, the "El Masri El Jom" journal said that the release of the hostages was prolonging because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after the ransom was paid.
Men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by stepdad "leaded to suicide"
Several years of father-in-law abuse led a woman to kill herself, heard in court.
After confessing to eight sexual harassment cases, 37 - year - old Michael Treris of the Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Truro Crown Court heard that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in a confession.
In court, it was also said that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Treris and his wife were divorced in the 1980 ’ s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said in court that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time volunteering for the National Trust organization, was persecuted by the specter of abuse that was committed on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife in court stated that in 2006 they called Miss Randle's friends, who also devoted herself to surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to suffocate herself with a plastic bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, the matter probably wouldn't have come to trial at all."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"She would obviously have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
An official who has lost his data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the Waterloo train at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the above law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC Secretary for Defense Affairs Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was handled internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
A staff member who may not be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the law in question, a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police charge the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al Qaeda and the possibility of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Credit unions face B&B debt
British credit unions may have to settle more than 80 million pounds after bailing out Bradford & Bingley.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million in Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative banks.
The CEO of the Association of Co-operative Credit Cards (BSA) Adrian Coles said he was "humiliating", that the credit cards and their members must pay.
In the end, the 14 - year - old debt will be repaid by bailing out Bradford & Bingley’s mortgages.
In the meantime, however, interest will be paid annually by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The compensation plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperative banks are accounted for in this number.
It's humbling that these institutions that have behaved wisely... now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from that prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the credit cards should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the banks will have to find 81 million pounds to pay back the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Co-Covers' Trade Association, told the BBC that he was convinced it wasn't fair.
"It is demeaning that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the expansion of the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions which were far from that prudent."
According to BSA, no credit card has fallen since it appeared in 1945.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what the possibilities are for protecting credit unions and their members from an account that could be substantial," he added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year, and this could be almost twice as much.
Given that cooperative credit unions are joint-holders without shareholders, this account will ultimately be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk will cost fivepence per litre
People in Jersey might have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy has announced that from Monday, it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by fivepence per litre.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence price increase in February, and it comes after research carried out by a consultancy.
Retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect more expensively at customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshan Expremier Denied
The Bangladeshi court rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid's request for bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegations that she had received over $50 million from a certain businessman, as well as $729,700, when she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption against it.
Khalida Zija, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has asked that the local army held by the government give her complete freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was released on her word of honor to undergo medical procedures abroad, it is not clear, according to the terms of her release, whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shaikh Hasina's request for bail, saying that he does not need bail when he is already having an examination abroad released for a solemn declaration," said her defense attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the High Court."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December election.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasina is to return home after 17 October.
She was detained last year after the army held by the interim government took power, but was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical intervention.
Sheikh Hasin and Khalid Ziyah both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in recent polio vaccination because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the U.N. did vaccinations in six provinces.
However, it says that for security reasons, she could not reach the children of the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
A UN spokesman said that despite Taliban promises, he would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB lost the ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost the litigation over the review of the Competition Commission decision, which ordered the company to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
According to BSkyB, BSkyB's tax advisor, the taxable profit of BSkyB's taxable profit is calculated on the basis of the taxable profit of BSkyB's taxable profit.
The Commission had previously stated that the share of BSkyB had undermined competition and had given the company disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in 2006 in a business which, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB gave cause to doubt the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of Virginia Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator of Ofcom, was all against buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution to the disproportional - mainly because the BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to waive its voting rights.
New investigation into the affairs of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report on the affair prepared by the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators, and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
In the report, Inspector General Glenn Fine stated: "A serious accusation, including a potential criminal act, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of the Special Prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry stated that the lawyers had been released due to poor performance.
However, it later became apparent that the dismissed lawyers were no worse rated than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate the allegations of electoral deception brought against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was put under fire for layoffs and eventually resigned.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of the role of Gonzales in the affair, saying that he was "the main responsibility" for layoffs, that he "abdicated" from his leading position and did not "remarkably engage".
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who comes to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" with the recognition he received.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of the Meat Loaf hit album from 1977.
This year's nominations are led by Coldplay, which has entered the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Reese, editor of Magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the fifteenth place at most.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album has been on the charts for about nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Day - has suffered from health problems in recent years, was also operated on due to irregular heart rhythms after he collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out he had cysts on his vocal cords.
Obscurary streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many Veterans cab drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village district and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic move.
There's no sign of street names.
It's practically invisible in a common atlas.
Still, he has an admirer's aisle.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to newly pave Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say that they were enchanted by a short aisle simply because it was one of the last remains from before the block was refined.
However, the City Authority for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which has the street in its power, has no interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the Municipal Community Land Committee, representatives of the Municipal Authority and Avalon Bay drew up a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee prefers the option of the street remaining in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The town has very few properties left, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for correction and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to pave the small street and set up seats, several of which would be used by a café, whose interest in renting the property is expected by the developer.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Office for the Conservation of Buildings, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the task of his office was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorn's big farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of CBGB led to Extra Place, a punkrock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background photo on the Ramones album cover "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about processing the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, albeit modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah’s Vanishing New York (with the subtitle “The Book of Wailing: A Bitterly Nostalgic View of the City in the Dying Process”), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the section Let’s talk about the city that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark and daylight, bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and nailed windows, where week-old newspapers run through the gutters."
Except for a few exceptions, the alleyway of a recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat passed through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where today stands a shop with expensive clothes.
There was graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty beer bottle next to a fresh batch of trashed newspapers.
A few passers-by said he rarely thinks of Extra Place, but suggested he could use a boost.
Fields, on the other hand, said that he thought that some people underestimated the impact of the alley in its current state.
"Best years of my life," he said, "they were in places dark, wet and disgusting."
Biling quality debate: immersion in English
In this edition, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic worker in California and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools".
It's a tricky business to reach out effectively to hispanic voters.
Barack Obama's educational agenda proves it.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes especially, among other things, "transient bilingual education" for those who are still learning English.
The question about Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles East.
The pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Even so, in the state math tests in 2008, an incredible hundred percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Almost the same amazing ninety-three percent of fourth grade students have reached the highest level in state tests in English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a method other than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Next, and Obama should notice, according to Linda Mikelsová, the principal of Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are learning English, is "complete immersion".
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me: "We had a tremendous success with one brand-new student from Mexico - after 12 months you would enter the classroom and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a role model, what should other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English-learning pupils look like?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question obvious, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Obama’s answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about "English only" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase the performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational models that work rather than mock them and trivialise them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the US plan to save the financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell by up to 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as by a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell earlier this month to almost $90 per barrel, and then again jumped on the wave of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety reengaged investors on Monday, even after the Congress Bureau announced to the Congress that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history this weekend.
This report was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy the bank division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the frenzied weekend negotiations, which led to a plan to save the economy, "returned as unable to revive the mood of the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become very uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts reported to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread throughout the world and especially to China."
This bank’s analysts limited their expectations to next year, as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth, and reduced their forecasts of gasoline prices to 2009 by about 20%.
The wild ride in the second quarter beats the team record
After spending the Jets in the last eight seasons more than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a sleepless ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals leveled their troubled game with gloomy clouds above them.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfect foreshadowing the afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved miles forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter after two more touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half game.
"It was nothing special," Favre told Coles about all his passes.
"He's a hell of a player.
We communicated well, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were rolling, defense attacked Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis picked up a stray throw and put him back 32 yards on the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and picked it up.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to blow.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely's twenty-yard goal out of the field, winning the lead 34-0.
That's the most the Jets ever got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
There were many points in a short period of time."
Rested Gebreselassia improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassia of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon he broke his own world record and became the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning the pleasantly flat track at time 2:03:59, he rolled his previous time by 27 seconds 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassia, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or is at least a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassia missed the Beijing Olympic marathon because he was afraid - perhaps too scared in retrospect - that air pollution upsets his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at start, 55 degrees at finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassia with a flashy average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebreselassia and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on longer lines, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebreselassia told journalists that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the break was more of a wake-up call than a delay.
"I am so happy," said Gebreselassia to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - because he was said to have over-planned his races, generally avoided world marathon peaks, relied on conductors, as if it were a race on a track, and built world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running qualities.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassia half in time 1:02:04.
After the conductors fell off, two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi were constantly chasing Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal Gebreselassia took last and escaped Kwambai, who then ran second in time 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in time 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitinenko, a native from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitinenko surprisingly won last spring at the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something that was described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon, which she had ever run, improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big lead and then dragged them about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in time 2:25:01.
Proudness and obstacles to the lives of black people in a separate city
Hidden among the vast amusement parks of the Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy, and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and intensity of African-American life come to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough guava, two schools, and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville festival Zora! to pay homage to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, even though she made it a stop for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that country blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many residents here remain wary of foreign views.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and a community of almost 2400 people, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is the center of literature, but also oaks shielded by an example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - which came from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the worry about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way to say Hurston here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through hearty books full of dialects like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city a bit into Route 17, which leads through the often ephemeral center of Florida, to the stage of black history and human drama.
With the shock of a big drum in her life and literature, Hurston introduced the reader to the store of the first Eatonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into an hour-long hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville connected with self-government, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Obviously, this wasn't a typical Fodor's publishing house.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy - seven - year - old Augustus Franklin recalls that, most of the time, when she rushed into the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevy, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of dignified clothing.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many scoffed.
"People always liked to see Zoru," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed like Eatonville had forgotten about her and the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920 ’ s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived.
There were no major funeral ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its significance in the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography "Wapped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
Change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the five-way highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-way main road.
Orlando's climbing has already pushed interstate highway 4 through the west edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the struggle to stir up races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration and declared his decision against the Education Chamber against Brown to be "offensive to my race rather than celebrating."
The inhabitants now claim that desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"Black children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You are not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there is a cultural barrier," said Ms.Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped create room for many other Zory Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the shelves at the bookstores and praised the resume of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, who re-entered it in the American Canon.
The highway project arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the ramp lights again.
The former Hurston neighbors now saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning the Hurston Festival to show what could happen to its highway.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway design.
"The five currents of the highway raised up, you'd say it detonated directly, real civic pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Winning the highway project helped change the city's image.
Extra-urbans like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the local church in 1993, began to appear in more numbers, and the inhabitants began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 at the re-academized and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes seem like a dark alley in the summer rain as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880 ’ s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated cautiously.
Permission for most interviews is necessary in advance and certain things - like murals in the oldest eatonville church, painted by white people and depicting black people in fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes deep red, are still worried that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival got bigger, so did home pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, there is a sincere love for the community when she plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, who she says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11 - year - old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass by, think, 'Well, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice town."
Here in New York, we're all fluent in finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not have realized that they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in a glazed bee hive of offices above their heads, every day bankers and hedge fund managers monopolizing New York have the worst "bad day in office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still raving with metal carts on the sidewalks and carrying muffin pans to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between towers and carry, like human mules, 50 ironed shirts hanging from the scales on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it is still not possible to get a yellow cab on weekday between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the pessimism talk, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this assignment to cover with a late afternoon siesta at my local branch, JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of cash windows to collect or store cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's mixed goods store and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already raised their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They raised money from so-called thrifts (a little bit like building savings banks), money associations, and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks went silently bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion worth of assets, went into bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion worth of assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and shops standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the saving on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent finance over the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and to her skinny chief executive, Dick Fuld, with such a familiarity, as if gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed 50-year-old landlord of my tenement, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation-- Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said to me, "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated after the Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian Right Party of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian Right Party Vlaams Belang participates in the demonstration which presented in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 the organization "City against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed out by the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties made huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were sometimes severely damaged between Friday evening and this morning and the police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as the star of David, but the detectives believe that this might have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred toward Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident was in any way linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic community here said that they are "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim Lent Month of Ramadan approaches the end.
Meanwhile, Austria enters the round of searching for its own soul after the right swings in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both ultra-right parties, which won more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the votes, protested against scarves and burkas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't take a trip abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, has forbidden the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police were granted this travel ban last Thursday after they handed over evidence to officials about Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, in his own name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal trial in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police applied to Ashford's lowest criminal court for a regulation that would prevent Mr Paul Gadda from crossing the border to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not attend personally."
64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, as it stores a record in his sex offender record.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also forward the planned departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A spokesman for the Kent police said: "Kentská policy will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to follow someone who stays in Britain because we have large systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police and we are working very carefully to monitor the behavior of recorded sex offenders in order to minimise any public danger."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls between the ages of 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities wouldn't let him pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal trial in West London and at the same time successfully requested an order that required him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I take pictures of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, free from focusing on interpretation - I will only achieve the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other hand, human.
Inseparable, aside from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see the intimate gesture, the depth of the glimpsed glance or the passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to appear on the stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatrics with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known face of masters.
With this intention, the photographer builds a unique iconography of flamenco from various backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place within the framework of the Flamenco Moon (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international meaning of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any kind of person, but when you look at photographs, you will find that they are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people portraited "on the street" are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portrait flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and lends it the present spirit, an idea reflected by the flamenco himself: "Music with very traditional roots, which, however, continues to surprise and evolve."
What tears down the audience is not the action of dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is the constant of work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of almost 70 photographers is made by famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology and will soon see a book release, which will contain exhibited portraits.
The passion for portraitry led Bauer to the idea two years ago to repeat the idea of a "Portréte sports veteran" ("SportART project").
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think in the photograph, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
One encounters or encounters people, personalities that sometimes do not even know, or only give them a few minutes to shoot.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the Gallery El Fotómata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he's writing is "trouble."
It takes place in an environment that he does not yet know and tells of events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled even in the Amazon.
Last night at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival, an eternal Nobel Prize favorite admitted that the project that employs him is "proud" and that "all indications are that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe that one day I will finish it," concluded his contribution at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which in four days saw about hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the town of aqueduct.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the festival of words and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had before him a dedicated audience, whose hour of time passed like water - Peruvian with amazing precision and a great deal of humor remembered how he wrote "disciplined" carefully, corrects and rewrites; or how he influenced his writing by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "remembrance pictures" are the basis of his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, a fleeting experience" - he emphasized Vargas Llosa, saying that "it affects people" and "the urge to try to get out of line", and urged the writer to "don't succumb to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of his mission.
Because of climatology, he loses the festival in Pozoblanc - missing lance
The performance with spears closing the festival in Pozoblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the square surface was not in good condition was confirmed.
That is why the company, along with Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions plague this festival in the long term, no longer two of the three celebrations could take place.
On Saturday, the rain made the second planned bullfight impossible.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to stand up to the bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
But that was only Friday night.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance was carried out on his shoulders.
On the same day in the afternoon Alejandro Talavante exchanged two wounds with spears for greetings and one ear, which was brought to him by the exposed seats in the arena rather than the Toreadorian art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the Los Llanos bull ring ungracious.
In the second round of hard work without a single breath of rest, he earned himself a harsh criticism from most of the audience.
They've escaped control in Alava in a van with 2,000 pounds of hash
Ten minutes to five.
Road Control Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (Alava).
The officers stop two people driving in the van, and they're getting away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report from the Home Affairs Department of the Basque Government, they were persecuted and detained by one of the people driving in a van, a man of 38 years of age who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was accused of smuggling drugs and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a roadside inspection on N-1 in places where they pass the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed instructions, accelerated and ran.
At that moment, the passengers jumped out and fled into the forest.
Finally, Ertzaintz’s officers caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as revealed during the search of the Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "scrashed" and did not agree with the information given in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for a second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to flee in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee A.A.J., 28, was transferred to the police department for proper formalities until further investigation is completed.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for drug driving.
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda's favorite from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers while trying to drive out of the Montecito parking lot, told People the spokesman for California Road Patrol.
The witness stated that around 4.30 p.m. Locklear "streaked on the gas, drove forward and backwards during the noisy roaring and tried to drive out of the parking lot - she ran over her sunglasses several times while backing up".
A witness who apparently didn't recognize the actress at first saw Locklear right after stopping on the nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because she "was afraid for Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented", so the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to submit to a test.
According to police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and the excess amount of alcohol was soon excluded, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was evident to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 19.00, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Association of IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The Chief General of the IU and Member of the United Left Gaspar Llamazares said today that the final decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Council of the City Hall in Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of acting for the benefit of his family, would depend on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested, which the party will have to proceed with in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that, in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct that Silva committed, "transparency" was absolutely necessary: "The AU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
Similarly, it stressed that the Party has a 'strict code of ethics for all public functions'.
"May blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), the epic bet by Garcia
José Luis Garci, in the film "May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by the Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós's national past, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around EUR 15 million.
In this way the filmmaker wanted to "draw the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of the company", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of performers.
May blood with a broom over two and a half hours will be introduced to the cinemas this Friday and in the future there will be more than a four-hour series for TV Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garci, he claims that by making this film he fulfilled the "child's dream", due to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago in the Autonomous Province of Madrid commissioned him to shoot a photo for the 200th anniversary of Madrid's 2nd May, he accepted the offer with the idea that the story would be based on the Episode of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid fully contributed, means for Garcia a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with sets and costumes corresponding to the image of "a raving Spain, which was wrong about the leader for whom it was possible to fight - the fight for independence led to the country's decline and backwardness during Ferdinand VII's reign," he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support received by the films Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or by Goya's spectres - almost double the blood of May - so he could not shoot some scenes from the script signed by Horatio Valcárcel, with which he works almost all his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empire) works as he is commonly used to - on the scene with actors he usually tries with before the shooting and who do not choose casting because it seems "humiliating" to him, and he also believes that "part of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas, among other things, to learn what happens in the craft he deals with".
Many of the actors he chose for May’s blood appear on his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci with four Oscar nominations, one of whom he has won, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May's blood alone, the Seven Tables of the French Billiard and the last chosen Blind Sunflower, represent a young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that 'it will yet appear'.
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're only working for profit, so you're willing to make one more movie," Garci explains with more than 30 years of directorship.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Sevilla's dancer Tortola Valencia
Sevilla flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevilla dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, from the father of the Catalan (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and the mother of the Andalusan (Georgina Valenciana Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, she and her family moved to London.
She danced modern dances and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering a woman's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and she fought for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, has bewitched Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenco rhythms.
So the "dance of the butterfly" evoked guajira or "dance of the snake" some thong.
Her dance was sensual and told me that my dance of this aesthetic also corresponds," she says.
The performance counts with the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel will lead, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in the "Open Doors" (La puerto abierta), and with the dance teacher Matilde Coralová, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she has accepted an offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the co-operation of the actor Juanfry Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadonians with all things, and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place at such a long distance, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was of those women who have a huge influence at some point, but today nobody knows her and even less appreciates her work," says Bayón.
The show starts at 8:30 today at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Newly Married Diary" closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The New Married Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), on the site where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Triennale of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
The "Zenobie and Juan Ramón Triennale" is coming to an end with the new edition of this work, the international congress to be held in New York, the Nobel Museum House repairs and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sun Beam" opened in May this year, and, after going around various Andalusian provinces, it should move to New York as planned at the time of the congress.
The cultural council of the autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Diary" prepared by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the most holy Andalusian poets.
America doesn't like itself that much without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of an actress named Sally Field, who worked with him on "No evil intent" and under the burden of knowing that Newman had left, revealing her dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he was retired from 2007.
And that he was known to be severely ill.
Even so, he was a man to all of us.
"Sometimes what a man feels cannot be expressed in any way, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when America's self-esteem is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons for pride.
When times are rough and people without virtue and only a handful of those who are worth your admiration - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from the anti-drug addiction foundation based on honor of the firstborn son who died of an overdose to his own brand of home-cooked food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that took a lot of effort to free itself from a suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, an Englishman named Daniel Craig, stated that one man did not die, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman has nowadays - based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, that's what people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
May his pride in heaven be with him that there is an alliance between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he has embodied, he was proudest of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a self-sacrifice philanthropist".
Impeccable Olympic Madrid Races
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the failed year 2012 it will be possible 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my judgment, he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense that if it were an evaluation and I was an examiner, it would clearly be inadequate.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
Nonsense starts with picking up the race number, which makes you have to go early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give you everything (including a chip to prevent overfilling the track).
Oh, no.
Here you had to first pick up a number (first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after standing the proper queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a S-sized T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need the size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they only decided to buy small T-shirts because it's less fabric and they're cheaper?
Well, that's a little something compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Besides the fact that he had to go very early for the chip and the queue lasted for over 15 minutes, he still had to hand over the backpack.
It took more than 35 minutes to wait, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put our backpacks down yet, and when we did, the pickup was much worse.
In addition, the wait extended by 40 minutes the rain, leading to general rebellion and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some, like me, will not show the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, did not record my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone had asked me about some perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
So I guess we'll just have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft showed further developments in the new system of image recognition and human interaction in the manner of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire company premises) and perceive what they hear in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they're wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort the present by conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that she is not part of the group that talks to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see anyone, and she's telling her that she'll be with her in a minute.
All without a blue death screen.
It's amazing.
But that is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the necessary, without the burden of commercial futility, they'd be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discovery as thunder, considering that Microsoft version since version adds new features to Windows and other "extra".
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and more to the internet browser.
The computer is turned on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time every day on the Internet than around windows.
What are half the applications that accompany the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a little example.
I took this photo in a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine that asked them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft’s employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's just count on 2010.
In Microsoft, they will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone's getting more and more computerized.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for delays.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppoly's "Godfather", and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to take on the list of his role in life, we can immerse ourselves in the image of a typical muscular man with a pointed mustache who lifts weights in a traveling circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton men's undershirt, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank', but Le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above all others.
First of all, because of his name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out over other high quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost unrecognizable) Belgian flag, which models have the most emblematic tank tops as detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't just specialize in tank tops.
He also makes sweatshirts college, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy shirts, baby outfits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful stunts for a comfortable underwear.
Although it's too bad they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
The tremendous resemblance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though tiny, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new acting in fashion very seriously.
It means a lot more to Monica than just some pretty, famous girl giving her name.
In Paris, Mango organized a promotion at its new headquarters and announced the most important fashion prizes sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's hearty and shy, and she'll win you over.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection, which my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango this year's autumn-winter season, and at the same time I participated in the announcement of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
So it was a challenging but exciting day.
What comes from your new collection for Mango, for which you've been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s, and we used them to be very stimulating.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around dressed, combine and plant their clothes, that's what I do very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I mean, I used to like clothes when I was a kid, and I always wanted to go to my grandmother's, and I used to wake up in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the fair.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to look out for the way I dressed.
You know, we dancers pride ourselves on how modified we are to feel good about our hours and our exams when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You just turned 30, did you have a crisis?
Nope.
I feel better than I've ever felt. I enjoy 30.
I find that the woman is finished, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological lessons don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So are you thinking of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants me to, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father is concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness, and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, you're about to have a few premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I can't wait for them to come to the movies.
I come from a theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course I can't do it.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like them...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the runway next to Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm going up to the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to take part in a benefit show for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes we've been doing - I've also chosen two models from our Mango collection - they've auctioned off, and the proceeds have been handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of talk about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity purposes, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do one, too.
For the benefit of women in the third world, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers caught repeatedly with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Interior Ministry requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol have to install a system in his vehicle that prevents him from starting his car drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was already known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its aim is to get the driver back behind the wheel, which is why drivers will also have to take a course in transport reeducation.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Cars (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of car drivers charged with more than once for drunk driving will again get behind the wheel in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if the alcohol concentration is higher than the permitted concentration.
Its price exceeds EUR 1,000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that infringements had decreased by 65% for vehicles equipped with this equipment during the first year since the introduction.
In Spain, 115 people are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, as legislation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary regulation of criminal provisions, however, requires the amendment of the law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been installed in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the proposal by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "Peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5.40 p.m., as stated in the program, a Spanish air force plane arrived in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in México D. F., where Prince and Princess Asturias arrived.
The sun had just set, but so far its rays had forced their hands to close their eyes so that they could see the successor couple getting out of the plane.
Under the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were visiting for a state visit.
Yeah, well, that's great.
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
But the Mexican press knows well who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just outside the red carpet and military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honest salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, very modestly dressed and with loose hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F. there is a storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation awaits, they smile at the photographers and pose freely.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, is waiting for them by a chatty Mexican television reporter.
Best subsidized fashion price
There's probably no place in the world more suitable to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there's probably not a more outstanding designer and blabbermouth than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation to new fashion talent.
The price is subsidized by EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, a first-year winner, looked at her designs in the Manga window on Housesmann 54, Paris, and almost cried with emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest store in Europe and it has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square metres.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank designer Valentin for taking over the chair of the competition jury, caused us to end up having a fancy dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
Firmou Mango's festively decorated chair table looked even more amazing next to Chagall's finest works.
Nati, who was heartbroken with grief for her brother's recent death, put on the clothes of this brand and the jewels of ELAH, over which she was breathless, and hung into her son Luis - a nearly two-metre elegant - accompanied Valentin at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, was greeted, and as a true gentleman, he remained with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, for they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in her own hand-designed pants and shirt and changed into a long black sexy dress for dinner, moved a night walk through the Opera with Goya Toledo's escort, showed us the ballet rehearsal hall and in memory of other times she grabbed one of the poles and indicated "grand plié".
Inés Sastre didn't stay for a tour of the palace buildings, but before she left, she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance not to use any scents in his rooms.
Stars under the starry skies of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about messy and furious everyday life.
To make matters worse, they are all summarized in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm rings at 7 a.m. every morning as punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself being absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two methods of combating everyday exhaustion and problems of detachment from the world of work.
No, the number is no bigger than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside Yogi positions, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book has gathered the whole "men" possibilities, adapted to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The stress book is called "1001 method of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing house will bring peace to the bookstore.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this view.
In addition, it offers further procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don’t have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
The first time this happens, it may scare you, but it's actually meaningless.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called the somnoly.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you has been told that he spoke in his sleep last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadicly (e.g. once in a lifetime in high fevers) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There's only one reason why she's coming.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fury, enuresis nocturna (night urination) or sleepwalking, but it may not be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fevers, stressful or turbulent situations.
In any case, this is a minor phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or quite the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases of great strength, it would be advisable to observe and consult an expert to see if he has a problem that causes him great anxiety and manifests himself in this way.
We said it was a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the baby too much before she goes to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can work to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
When the somnilovia appears, try to remain calm.
Recall that she is harmless to the child and that she will remember nothing of what happened the next day.
Useful Advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're gonna interrupt his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and he rests.
Remember, if several times in a row you feel that she is in great pain, it would be advisable to seek advice or to find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If it is understood what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when she's asleep, she's not conscious enough to organize her thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he dreams about, and therefore why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you draw.
Never tell a kid you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Just don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory after a long, thin period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks have created more chances and managed to turn one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were difficult to enforce.
After the first attempt of the captain hosts Kauffmann, who shot from a distance just by a hair past the link, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemaria.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field and left only agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well situated for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, Golman Illhaeusernu did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room to leave his teammates weakened.
Dannemaria, however, could not benefit from it and the eleven of Illhaeusern, who only withdrew a little to "intensify" the defense, no more causing any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the beam after the big confusion.
Sarkozy Goes To Angry Fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a detour through Brittany.
In order to counter the demonstration of the power of fishermen, who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports, the French President decided to go to Guilvinec port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to be adopted 'in a constructive spirit', hoping that 'it will come up with concrete proposals'.
The presidential visit is coming at the same time as the General Assembly of the 'crisis committee' created by Breton fishermen in order to take action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elysée Palace spokesperson David Martinon, "the President will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and the payment of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected of fishermen with tenacity.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation called "snake" (operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of constipation.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was opened on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Sailors proved their determination on Monday, when immediately at dawn before the port fuel warehouses in Brest and Lorient burned tires and pallets, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the canal of la Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and from Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped during the evening the blockade of the important Refinery Total in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act on Wednesday at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is to decide on how to continue the journey, and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Department of Fisheries, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not abandon anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the fishing department in Lorient.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but consider that the ship’s profitability threshold is only achieved when the oil is below EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman Magnificent
An unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes bowed to the legend of the film and the politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply conditions for 2008
This year, Brazil’s aircraft manufacturer relies on a supply of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of recession hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains his delivery conditions for 2008 with 215 supplied instruments, confirmed by his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half, the manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a great deal from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer supplied 41 instruments to Chinese clients within eight years.
They say AIG is considering transferring 15% of its assets.
The insurance company of the American International Group, whom the U.S. monetary authorities have put above water, is considering advancing more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that they have been given as a down payment, reports the Sunday Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying a diary that quotes sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to France Télécom, the AIG Board met on Sunday during the evening to examine the eventual assignment.
Any confirmatory statement could not be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG is planning to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp. aviation leasing subsidiary, its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance provider, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investment, are supplied by France Télécom.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, France Télécom continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash in order to repay the loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve provided him with the risk that the US authorities would seize 80% of his capital, thus also diluting it into the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of historical sitting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s bank bailout plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of an approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The biggest point drop in its history (by 684.81 point) recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trading after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to definitive data after the trading deadline, 199,61 points and settled to 1 983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Depressed since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally collapsed following an unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan by the House of Representatives, a plan that was supposed to allow a little stability to be found in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to give Henry Paulson the Treasury Secretary the funds he asked for.
Almost two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent out to the market, which sees that Congress is unable to accept a plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days should not come "too late".
"If this project is really doomed (...), the relay will be handed over to the Fed immediately (the US Central Bank, note red) and to other central banks to prevent the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions more," warned Brian Bethune, head economist Global Insight.
And with emphasis on Piegza's urgency, she pointed out that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of bank Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took a turn and demanded urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not facing "only the US crisis but the world crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has grown strongly.
Cashout income to 10 years fell to 3.632% compared to 3.827% on Friday night, yield to 30 years to 4.161% compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate was to find out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama had won.
The leaders’ tents of the Republican and Democrat campaign were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a television duel that was watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, however decent, was not "brillant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in the polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose polls published on Saturday give Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), considers that the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that currently matter, Obama is a winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% attributed the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday, using the expected good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton pointed out this weekend.
Seventy-seven McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "naivity" in the issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
Republican TV spots have been carried in such an offensive spirit since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and turned out to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does," replied a democratic spot on the weekend, accusing the Republicans of not taking enough account of the impact of the crisis on the "common American".
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
Nor did he utter words like "medium class" or "working class". Financial decay clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider more competent to save the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"Next week could be a decisive turn," estimated the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the candidate of democrats, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as conducted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
The Senator of Illinois reaffirmed that despite the unexpected leaps of Wall Street, he should be able to reduce taxes to 95% of Americans, and he also pointed out that the realisation of the country's potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions regarding the $700 billion financial aid plan (€470 billion), which was accepted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening on the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of the electoral rooms in Minsk's main square to protest against the illegality of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to protest against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they did not even go to elections: "What good would it do if they did what they wanted with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian capitals and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census," complained Juri Potemkin, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexandr Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and a leader in the pro-European movement, "because it is important who counts the votes, and in our country it is an executive power.
If any opposition Members get into Parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their accession to Parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and draft laws."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because 'a dialogue with the European Union must be started.
If the crisis hits our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election process, should not declare the elections valid.
It emphasises that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there were any elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no one in the polls.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in Parliament, those who are most in line with the regime."
The night silence again hosted the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - Blood that is sure again
Yesterday, Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the foundation, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced because Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the public’s confidence, which was seriously shaken after the blood - contaminated scandal in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
As is generally known, the national blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated by the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Canadian government launched a public investigation chaired by Judge Horace Kráter to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Kráter tarried to report, some provinces set in motion a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was played by the Gelinea Committee.
After Gélineau and the Kráter report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, who was to run Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for supplying all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec began his activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system," recalls Dr.
"The situation was daunting.
With a consistent effort to increase the safety of blood products and permanent work in this area over the coming years, we have regained public confidence," Hema-Québek said, proudly adding that almost 94% of the Québek population trusted in early 2008.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
"Then we witnessed many cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has been leading the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of Kráter and Gélineau's report, according to which, if we do not know this and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures must be taken.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, the disease was safely proven to be transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to follow the principle of prudence."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for HIV virus detection appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that directly detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood rather than the presence of antibodies on which tests were based before.
The NAT tests enabled the deaf period to be shortened between the moment of the patient’s infection and the moment when our techniques in the blood may reveal the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements have allowed the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions to be significantly reduced.
Today, one in 12 million people are exposed to the risk of receiving HIV - contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission via blood products occurs.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary for recovery," says Hema-Québek, head of management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of disease element can appear in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like West Nile, is transmitted into the blood by insect stings.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," Dr Décary continues, stressing that besides safe supplies, Hema-Québec must also count on sufficient supplies.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment for cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for donation."
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, which means six times a year.
On average, 14% of those offering blood are not accepted, for example, because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a land where mud fevers are rampant, they are excluded for one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
But it is difficult to persuade people to give blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to give blood," Francine Décary writes.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Québek, which also manages the only public bank of cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, has blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood samples from the umbilical cord into the bank, and we expect to collect over a thousand a year.
We should start offering them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all the hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final series of the first division of USL yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and final round of the quarter-finals played on the total number of goals, thanks to the 3-1 win (4:3 goal balance after both matches) over Sounders from Seattle.
Backer Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-way goalless first half, the backup team David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Let us remind you that on Friday during the first of the two quarterfinals, the Impact in Starfire Complex in Tukwila in the suburbs of Seattle suffered a 2-1 defeat.
The impact will measure its power in the semifinals with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled the 3-1 deficit in the home game and finally won 4:3, but Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a total score of 5:4.
Impact should meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovaleva's winning goal
The first attack trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kosticin last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev reaped one pass in this fourth win of three-colored of six preparatory games.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
"I need one more fight to make me feel good."
"In the first period he tried to handle too much," remarked Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice round of applause."
Charest bets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) convention, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running for office in today's supplementary elections.
"Delegate the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition presented by Jean Charest yesterday in a visually engaging way at the end of the Quebec Liberal Convention in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his talk, pictures were shown behind his back in a kind of picture grinder.
On three giant canvases ran a loop with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, like in the pre-election period.
After all, at a press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that it would trigger early elections in autumn, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The "Plan North" is the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, the vision of the "new economic space", which includes the agreement with France on the labour force, the agreement between Canada and Europe and the agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - Northern Territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "denomination with enormous potential", but it did not mention the term, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forests, but mainly the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice the size of France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it is not only with us, but it is in us," he emphasized, as if he wanted to show that he is appealing to a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, highlighted the Prime Minister: the gold hunt in Abitibi, Québecian engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he was silent, to look at a huge map behind his back.
North, 70 % of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, was specified by the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all existing governments.
There is one border line that has long been without a treaty, and if an appropriate opportunity arises, I will retake this position in the name of the government," he said.
Otherwise, 'there is also a need to rethink our vision of the North in relation to climate change', he said, when he spoke about the North-West transition, which will open year-round due to the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the lands, the indigenous nations, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Québek government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially to young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequito MP from Ungava), have already opened negotiations with about 30 communities.
The interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier started its activities and has an important role as Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, 'not necessarily a summit', but a moment when a common vision will be established.
The development of the North should, moreover, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a continuous follow-up to the vision of liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Just like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
After all, this was one of the ever-shattered topics of the weekend, which started on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting Jean Lesage's 50th anniversary as the party leader.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to christen Beauharnois' headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who revolutionized and nationalized water electricity, to Bouras, who created James Bay, our party managed to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister between 1957 and 1963.
When it came to the dam hydroelectric plant Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest emphasized that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his member base, giving him a big round of applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling elections in the autumn of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his program was busy, especially with the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend convention provided the chief of liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "enhancements to amend the constitution", which went very smoothly: PLQ (Québek's Liberal Party) particularly demands recognition of the "Québek specificity" in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint part of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council who would have the right of veto in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was sceptically adopted in its main features.
PQ Chief (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois re-launched the North Quebec Development Policy launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced its implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck to it, 'we would have moved on today', Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) François Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"But we wish it was not a mere theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" in Harper's cabinet, who took the liberty of saying about Louis Arboure in the summer of last year that he was a disgrace to Canada.
In this way, to disgrace a woman who has waged an unfailing fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, this speaks to a great deal about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not brought back to its homeland a national locked up in Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that has no regard for the fact that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at a time when the actions he was accused of were to take place.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty international and especially the Association of Canadian Lawyers defend Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can look forward to a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little does it matter that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, and this is undoubtedly permanent, after so many years of torment.
We don't realize it, but we're witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our "democracy", the words that Harper's been throwing around so much and that sound so empty out of his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, imprison him according to the will of the chief of the minority government so far (as it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that proclaims honor, law, and order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made up the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame on you, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellian discourses by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has begun to prosecute three authors and a poor little publishing house for libel in order to provoke a "transparent public debate" and demand six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for libel, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver's radical resolution is completely passing.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate, to ruin anyone who dares defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and to fight a very uneven battle with an army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of mining company.
After all, the tactics in these unbalanced battles often consist in bankrupting the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will clog the counterparty’s mouth and, moreover, dismay anyone who dares to pursue this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of the whole thing to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, Canada normally has a debate in exchange for ideas rather than a baton.
Thus, mining companies were not enough to open up their books, their documentation, and to bring real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the matter.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion, and he rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a 'public debate' and, at the same time, despise the opinion of the same public?
In the vice president's world, that word seems to refer to only fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that is a rather narrow concept of that concept.
In a democracy, even libels have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because he rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many see as prosecution, in which the defendant is to be blocked (in the context of his prosecution of the "public debate", Barrick has just presented an official invitation to Noir Canada authors to officially announce that they should stop using this term...).
Apart from the surreal Garver speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of exploration and the search for the truth that is essential for every democratic society.
Overall, he denies the right to citation of credible sources and to the debate about facts and interpretations that are itself the basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without being subjected to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be created if it followed the scientific standards used by Noir Canada’s authors.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would limit such a type of wrongful prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Yesterday, the Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, came to an agreement on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan, using $700 billion to slow the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of stored public money, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to non-payments, and also the right to monitor the level of wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis currently taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disruption of American daily life will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last hours, negotiations have gone to maximum speeds for fear of the effect that another failure would have on investors’ state of mind.
The time limit was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed themselves rather in favour of an agreement, but without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added to the agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of allowing owners to remain in residence, and on the wage of the head of the state of employment of the rescued companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures for some people's irresponsibility, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the television waves.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station to vote in favour of the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I've read show that it's something we're all going to have to spend, and it's going to be possible to move on.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700 billion plan is to buy out dubious receivables and risk and non-saleable assets from US financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis unleashed by the bursting bubble in the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the decomposition of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of last week's first draft agreement was caused by Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats agreed that the government would only guarantee some of the "toxic" assets of companies having difficulties, but not buy them, there is a belief that the impasse is averted.
In an effort to bring conflicting views closer together in Congress, a measure was added that the government would be able to introduce new charges to help her regain her deposit if, as a result of the programme, she had to take on losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add an additional 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in saved companies, which, in the event of profits, will pay him dividends and which it will be able to resell when this is over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of property associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The directors of the plan would like to put him to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project in both Republican and democratic camps.
"It is quite obvious that Washington can't hear you," declared Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's financial committee, to the electorate.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, making money on taxpayers is not the answer."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed "the Skeptic Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and to examine carefully which route to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from buying its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis of risk loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurance companies.
"We will not lose this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
This is what savers and households today can appreciate."
On the other side of the Channel La Manche so far, the British government seems to have launched the nationalization of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than USD 41 billion (75,5 billion) constituted loans to buy real estate.
According to her announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will purchase branches and accounts of British bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must nationalize from the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes for a long time represented his trump card, according to others a weakness.
Did this American actor break out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, tenderness, and unfailing talent that was his own also distanced him from the power category that begets true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at his ranch in Connecticut at 83 years of age as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the latest icons of fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, who had been like him for a long time, was his rival on a movie screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often gives birth to beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country in love with a self-made mana, a warrior in the Pacific War, wounded in a battle that studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then visited New York Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theater, on TV and soon in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who ranked second in the 24-hour Le Mans race in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, despite the fact that since 1958 he has been a model couple with Joanne Woodward.
With him also leaving the shady places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused dizziness to film lovers, while his big roles compete on the black screen of memories.
After him, he defils more than half a century of constantly changing American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) emerges in memory again, a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a hot roof, the adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From a less ancient past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled at an advanced age of marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, abused, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the Sign of Hate) Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 introduced Newman to a real acquaintance.
A likable gangster in a totally great The Sting, Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful pool player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face that travels for ages, it was him.
It's him again.
In his career, different eras compete.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Coen Brothers.
He then closed his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends that had left the craft quite soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its gilded, pompous, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him "a living challenge to underplaying", considering that he pushed him too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as on a platter, the profession was not always so tender.
The first lovers, however, played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate ones, whose declines and rebellions reflected in his perfect features.
As director Newman, he revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (according to the novel by Margaret Laurence of Canada), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness, dedicated to his son Scott, whom he lost because of an overdose.
In the rush of honours that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented: "His presence made my life and this country better."
The grandeur, the love of life, these are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, the great civil rights fighter, ecology, independent film, opponents of Hollywood's decline, is also leaving.
His likeness we used to see on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed rather tasteless to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Hard Childhood.
Newman was so, rather than being lulled by glory, to the very last moment engaged in society.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to watch the career of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, October 8th, the trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Among other crimes, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed in the long term and systematically by a criminal organisation, which has caused extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecution, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often documented the fulfilment of their tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and self-government - totalling approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the Fiatal Ballodal treasury, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The way he also informed the investigating authority was that the money received in the tender was collected on the basis of invoices which did not give rise to actual consideration and the undertakings accepted were never fulfilled by the associations.
According to the prosecution, a lot of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Yozsefros market, and round stamps were produced in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of which companies are to produce invoices have been decided, among other things, on a sightseeing tour along the northern bank of Balaton, on which István Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his testimony, the first name was to look for boarding houses and restaurants.
In them he asked for bills for his consumption, according to whose model invoices were then produced in the framework of public competitions published by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and, respectively, the Self-government of the Capital.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by István Lados with his associate András ?ri, who according to our information wrote the most often the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip" Lados looked up a beer hall.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering establishment provided catering for a 90-member group from Biztos Pont.
However, according to the company manager, so many people would not suddenly fit into this facility.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer 2002 to Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was swarming with formal and content errors.
The pension in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet an invoice included 130 guests.
However, the fillers of the forms with a rich imagination overtook it even when they listed on the documents of the company involved in the hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts according to the information provided to the prosecutor's office documents in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even figure.
The head of Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was summoned to the D.A. and showed him invoices, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were stamped in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, it was not agreed that according to the invoice they had accommodated a hundred people, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included catering, with their restaurant no longer working for a long time.
Zealous invoice manufacturers did not even convince themselves that the sought-after Budapest travel agency only organises foreign trips, and on the invoice with cash payment, which also did not match the company's billing practice, foolishly referred to it as a travel brokerage service in Hungary.
Moreover, as was apparent during the investigation, they also indicated VAT in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
The four documents issued by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree either with the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the 25 % but by 15 % VAT, and in addition the hotel staff issued only printed invoices, but the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "publishers" corrupted the invoice, for example, by stating with one company how it became apparent thanks to the prosecutor's investigation, as a road transport activity, which was not originally carried out on investment advice.
The fact that invoices issued by the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and the association XXI. Szazadi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false, also because of formal deviations - not corresponding to the format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As with Ravenna k.s. or the Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time of the 2001 meeting of the Fiatal Városért group, which is why according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper.
The invoices were exhibited consciously
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for around four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Ballodal - Ifju Szocialisták organization.
According to the prosecution, the head of Collab s. r. o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlage and its associates were also co-operated by Biogate s. r. o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided Jobb Jövőért and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth around five million forints, for which there was no actual economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of billing companies includes those who had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but on which the company is not available.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment assets worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the information found in the investigations, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was also supposed to hand over documents relating to the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and accepted their countervalue.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get a job.
Nevertheless, he benefited from the fact that, at the request of the co-convicted lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The D.A. concluded that Kubatov had come to 10 percent of the amounts shown on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for the Biztos Pont association, the man also used Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszágért submitted proposals for the competition of the Mihálye Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public-service organization of the Socialist Party.
They obtained after 500 thousand forints, but did not spend on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To make this clear, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a home search at the Office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, a part of the defendants will probably describe the course of production of invoices, as they have already done in the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if he decides to expose himself to the main defendant János Zuschlag.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will explain everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the payment of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, with him perhaps the socialists have made an agreement and Zusi will take the fall.
Moreover, he could have been offended so far, since his requests to mitigate the conditions of his detention, i.e. to place him under house arrest, have remained unheard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes who have done far greater damage than they have done so far can freely walk or at least wait for the end of their proceedings in their homes, he does not have this option.
The psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people do not want to lag behind in the eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Research was using an experimental auction to map the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in the stage auction, examining the active areas of the brain of experimental subjects using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, the important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to function intensively when losing.
This brain area plays, among many other functions, a role in the "self-remuneration" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to researchers, it is therefore possible to explain the unscrewing of the price by avoiding the sharp reaction of the stretch marks.
To support their theory, members of the economists’ research team conducted a financial cross-cutting survey.
Three groups cite against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product and they made bets.
In addition, members of another group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive $15 more in reward.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost this money as well.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was all about stressing one’s win and the other’s loss.
However, members of the group playing "against defeat" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winner" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
Until now, these have explained phenomena observable in auctions for the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
It was neurological imaging methods that helped us resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we now came to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are treated, often because the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, typical of inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the origins of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways, depending on the underlying disease: hepatitis A and E to the digestive tract (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travelers should in any case be protected by vaccination against A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against a type C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after taking an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
After that, jaundice, light stools, and dark urine are formed on the skin and the eyes. The treatment may last for two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people around the world die of a more serious type of disease, liver cancer, and hepatitis B liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is that estimates are that only one in ten infected patients are treated medically.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to hepatic cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected do not even know about their disease, causing the disease to destroy liver cells insidiously, so the first symptoms occur in many cases up to 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important to prevent early, to carry out regular writing.
In three groups, this disease occurs a lot more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already show routine laboratory testing, a person should contact his or her physician if he or she notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent infection and to prevent cancer.
September 30th is the world day of hepatitis, which was organised by organizations representing the sick for the first time worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, to the causes of it and to the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God works as an analgesic that might have facilitated the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, researching how man’s faith in the god of pain affects, reported the British daily Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all watched the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
The technique of examining the human brain has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
Research is the first of a series of researches involving scientists, philosophers, and theologians from various parts of the university alongside academics.
The exact test was carried out by attaching a spark instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which produced electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe the two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary, dating back to the 17th century, and the Lady with the Edge of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of Our Lady would create a certain state of piety for believers, while Da Vinci’s image was chosen because they did not differ much from the first one and seemed to make a calming impression.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received in four consecutive parts 20 electroshocks, while separately watching the picture with religious or general topics.
Catholics said that when they looked at Our Lady, they felt "safe," as if they had been "taken care of" and "calm down, filled them with peace".
They felt 12 percent less pain in watching a religious picture than when they had Leonard’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by means of any powerful image even in atheists, just to find the right photograph.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they showed them some Madonna from Leonard or a painter of similar caliber.
Would the view of the quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
♪ You're what you share ♪
On their tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations they go to, and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics paralleling Orwell's dark vision are concerned, the very nature of site 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google founders to stick to their original intention, which was: "Let's get all the information in the world!"
According to Google’s questionable representative, even after ten years of worldwide work, the company is only at the beginning of working with all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would it actually be good for me?" - but such seemingly simple questions will not be able to answer software until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know very well that search words and the IP address from which they were searched and which pages they moved to after the search are captured during the internet search.
Thanks to Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep their surfing history, look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, which generates findings adapted to them in the long term – the same logic will be based on the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously mentioned and maintained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - users who are afraid when they look at the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the scope of potential power represented by the company is threatening, counter-reaction does not create guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous recent example was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of the pedophiles from the community sites of Orkut established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personality rights could still rest in May when the company, hand in hand with the EFF Electronic Rights Protection Organization, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not, even in the future, be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained with reference to strengthening the law adopted years ago on child protection, but still failed to get lists of search items of individual users, or complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be exposed to harm by their starting to use Google services, and they act against it with a revolt that belongs to multinational companies with conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild branch, grouping around with enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big companies, a "corporation that's hot now," unlike its rival Microsoft, considered for Windows as the conqueror of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, more youthful, "cooler" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this can also be due to the fact that geeks understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which brought with it just one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is nothing more than cooperation, that we deliberately leave clues behind and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although their range is different for everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which record the music he listens to, and then connect it all to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, as well as a blog that will automatically show up his latest photogallery, which he stores on Flickr or Picase.
While we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which we can see: a girlfriend in the morning when looking at a flood of photos of her mutual friends can easily figure out who her bewitching friend spent the evening with, or the company can fire its employee just because on their blog they describe their sincere opinion of the top management: one thing is for sure, the concept of private life has been completely re-evaluated today.
The person who lives online is made up of what shows of himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (beginning, for example, Scroogle, which uses Google's search system, but does not intentionally leave traces).
For example, a small number of people do not deliberately register on community sites to be found. Online Google applications from a text editor to a photo editor and a news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not create the best possible profile.
Public opinion does not very secretly expect Google to show teeth.
With a present value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites threaten investment by advertising agencies and services introduced at an ever-rapid rate seriously make life not only unpleasant to Microsoft, but also to numerous other software designers.
In addition, critical observers also find counterpoints that have an alarming impression: for example, the senior management has completely rejected employees’ protests after raising the company kindergarten fee twice as much, according to the company’s management the daily diet has been too expensive, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and in the sense of their agreement, it will filter out any finding that defies good taste, or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company’s internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the following months and years can be skewed by the world in new places: while some believe that Google’s project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines takes on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous Cory Doctorow novel "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscence a future in which one can only draw close to a person with Google data.
The double killer from Ozda helped remove the tracks of two juveniles
Two minors were questioned by the police in the case of a double homicide in Ózda, which is believed to have helped with the removal of traces of this crime, said on Tuesday the spokesperson of the Supreme Police Directorate of County Borsod.
Persons have confessed to the activity of which they were suspected and are currently charged with aiding the offence.
Both juveniles, according to MTI's information, two girls are being prosecuted at large.
Aiding a criminal offence is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozda, a 23-year-old male here, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a felony premeditated multiple murders for self-interest reasons.
During the investigation, it turned out that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old man a greater amount.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a facility in Ozda last Wednesday, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man prepared himself to commit the crime beforehand, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder by a weapon hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100 % package of Prague Stock Exchange shares.
Ludwig Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party despite the fact that the Czech Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously excluded the Czechs from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the State.
99 % of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell 60 % of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börs have so far submitted an offer.
Prague Stock Exchange Chief Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 % of the shares could be sold out.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25% share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the point of view of European papers
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading newspaper recalls "September 2nd".
We can thank the American President for the global financial disaster, accusing Roman La Repubblica. The President was not even able to stitch up his own party in support of the fast-paced bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which resembled a billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about September 2nd.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo, a lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is constantly increasing, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Although the Bush plan was not perfect, after the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just at the moment when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, notes the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw a lifesaver into winding money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from failure.
But if more banks collapse like domino cubes, then neither money nor further improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, stagnant monetary institutions received more than EUR 100 billion, recalling the Vienna Der Standard, which is concerned that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets in order to resolve the crisis, they are increasingly real.
The European Union has not yet seriously dealt with the crisis that, as a tsunami, is rolling through the old continent.
The "rescue" need not immediately wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good for them to establish in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Smart Car Imitates Bumblebee Flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitation detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
With bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of a surprising project presented at the Japanese trade fair CEATEC was inspired by engineers from Nissan Bumblebees. It was about how to build a new generation of collision prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan designed a biomimetic robotic control system such as BR23C, a robotized minicar equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is in fact very similar to our safety cover," Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technological PR and research and development.
Composite eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions of view.
To copy the function of the folded eye, engineers reached for the idea of the laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters in front of BR23C in the 180 degree field of vision, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which will instantly be transformed into an operation aimed at preventing collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotized car starts imitating the movements of the bees and turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver is taking place in an entirely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, a robotic car could not respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Lab and robotic car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective package, which is currently considered inevitable within the collision.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not last longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotation, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent reactions are important, not processing ability, the less data storage.
This mechanism must only process and respond to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need to store them and respond using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, therefore they constantly use only memory of the size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with a giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing an immediate avoidance technology that, according to Nissan, could reach serial-produced vehicles within ten years.
Another option of application may be the connection of the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified final destination after avoiding obstacles.
A bloody dear child already has a name.
The $700 billion economic bailout bill, which is to be divided into several instalments and which aims to buy off poor bank loans, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight of American Eastern time, Congress officials reached an agreement in a few days of debate over a $700 billion bailout, said Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the House of Representatives, according to which only the drafting of the agreement remains.
Both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the compromise on the package.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and it will be effective, but further action needs to be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock in the evening of Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 o'clock in the morning of Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft legal standard, hearing in the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, which is to be established by the programme, then it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the news of the agreement was also welcomed at the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate both parties' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said spokesperson Tony Fratto.
After all, the program differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which was intended to make the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities spend an entire $700 billion at once.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of $700 billion in the first round, so that $250 billion will be used immediately after Congress is expected to decide on the matter on Monday, and the Treasury will buy mortgage-backed securities, which are rated as poor, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the president's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special corps, the chairman of which will also be a member of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on Congress' next decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the Act: it can simultaneously buy low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "poisoned" loans.
The purchase can take place directly within the auctions, and the competent representatives of the Ministry have informed them.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance grants them a guarantee for the means constituting cause for concern, for which the company will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to meet the urgent demands of the US financial system, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank bosses who are in trouble and waiting to help the state can count on the government to cut their severance pay - which is simply called a "gold parachute" in overseas slang.
They will be limited only in certain cases, and these restrictions will depend on the mode of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax premium will be imposed on gold parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of a direct buy-back of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively take action to ensure that money for management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the already existing gold falling treaties will not change, the restriction concerns only new ones, which is to be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history to have legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs in force," commented the Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
Moreover, the state in the banks participating in the programme will have the right to acquire a stake, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since once the economy and the saved bank are on their feet, they can also make money from this transaction.
The proposal's plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
Of course, there have also been voices on both sides expressing doubt in relation to the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this will not protect taxpayers' dollars," said the Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, feels that exactly those responsible for Wall Street's collapse insisted on the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, then by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent year on year.
Production prices in industry were 0.7 percent higher as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, rising by 3.2 percent yoy.

Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in the luggage and saddlery products sector by 4.6 percent, respectively, and footwear production by 2.5 percent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 percent).
Prices were reduced in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other manufacturing sectors, we have measured the price increase in the range 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water distribution sector, which has a large weight in domestic sales to the industry, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly by the continued effect of the officially established increase in gas prices since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in each industry, prices increased most in the oil processing industry (32.4 percent).
In the co-production sector, 13,2 % could be observed, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products with a decisive weight, then 11 % increase in prices.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile industries (2.5 percent) and in the electrical machinery and apparatus production (0.3 percent).
In other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6% and 9.1%.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry increased by 10.2% during the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water industries exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
From the point of view of the sector's focus, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the material asset production sector was shown on domestic sales in August.
In the consumer goods sector, prices increased by 0.3 percent; in the energy processing and further processing sectors, prices did not change in relation to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 in relation to the same month of the previous year was observed in energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods industries, we have measured an increase in prices of 6.8 percent, while in the case of tangible assets, we have measured a fall in prices of 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened 1.7 percent in relation to the euro in one month, then 7.1 percent in relation to the dollar, increased 7.5 percent in relation to the euro in comparison to the euro in August 2007 and 15.9 percent in relation to the dollar.
Next year, to the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force around 12 January, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, 'almost everything now matters if an electronic travel authorisation system, or checks, is built on time overseas'.
At the same time she pointed out that the new system will not include permission to enter, but tourists will have to register before they leave.
As of today, the representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington.
She will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order for Merit about the Republic of Hungary and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are both for the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, have consistently assured the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but they are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a few days of the meeting of Congress and representatives of the administration, an early announcement was made on Sunday morning: a basic agreement was concluded on the bank bailout package.
The financial package, which aims to reposition the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have consistently identified themselves as more suitable for both candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, at the same time as how economic issues came to the fore, Obama regained some advantage and McCain’s lead disappeared, which secured Sarah Palin’s nomination for Vice President after the Republican Convention.
Obama expressed the hope that the $700 billion package bill would be passed quickly by Congress at a pre-election meeting in Detroit on Sunday.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages concerning consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) to your places, savings, the entire industrial sector, stability of the entire economy is at risk," he said in front of the 35,000 crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain, in an interview with ABC, explained: "It's all going to be a bit abhorrent (...) but doing nothing is simply not an option."
As the Republican Senator said, the proposal includes the setting up of a commission overseeing the Minister of Finance and reducing severance pay for the senior officials he insisted on.
Obama declared to CBS that McCain did not have a more substantial role in the negotiations, he himself was in daily contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, House President Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Print Overview of the German Language Region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside became more confident - so it analyses the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the Red and Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats His Fathers".
According to a known political scientist, CSU erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over its office.
For decades, Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria - and now these very modern citizens are turning away from it.
Changing periods is a problem for the whole Christian democracy, and so for Angela Merkel.
The debate was not entirely surprising for CSU, but on Saturday the process that could be expected for almost exactly ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005, i.e. in the Stoiber period so often mentioned.
The reason for this is the modernisation that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that eats up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the pace. Secularization, education results, settlement of Germans from the East and the North in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequences on CSU voters' loyalty.
Modernization is linked to the growth of possibilities, which has its visible political implications.
Right-wing camp is intact, only voters inside became more confident, more critical, more headstrong.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has been the most remote from the classic civil class; free-traders, graduates, and university education.
This has already shrunk CSU’s support below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who, with whom? The leaders of the parties are being held back on the issues of the coalition", the Vienna daily focuses on the confused internal political situation arising as a result of the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the interference of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate on the coalition.
The elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in a debate held on public television, the party leaders did not take much insight into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both sides is certainly possible - in some Länder and in social partnerships it exists.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted at every turn.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer responded with caution to the red bids.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed definitely within ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider again seemed open to all directions.
"To prevent the Red and Black Coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóková: A vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equality Summit, which is hosted by France, the current President of the European Union, began in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert debate in her message addressed to plenary, turned her attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
On behalf of the French Presidency, Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference.
The debate was held among invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civic associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs of the Fidesz Járóková movement, she pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in recruitment, Romani people are driven out of the European labour market mainly due to their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education."
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to confirm the knowledge of these contexts in the widest circles - between Romani and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"To Romani people the right to their citizenship of the European Union is the need to ensure the right to a quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, the European Union's cohesion is needed, with emphasis on the objective and negotiations, in order to speed up school desegregation processes immediately, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations are correctly complied with.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, so that Romani children can participate in the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóková demanded.
Everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to eliminate discrimination set out at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: temporary pardon
The fate of the serving duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the disgraceful electoral debacle, the debate on personal questions has been adjourned by the top Bavarian CSU so far.
Chairman of the Erwin Huber Party and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress last weekend in October.
In any case, members of a highly criticized duo let themselves be heard that they would not cling to their posts with all their strength.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to derive personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, even under Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but it was only able to achieve 43.4 percent.
CSU has been a self-governor in Bavaria for 46 years, producing 18 percent of German GDP.
While conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to have a high position, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first features of reorganization within the party is the fact that the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber, will also be a member of a narrow intelligence team, which will open the sounding negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with the right-wing Free Voters group.
Ironically, Gabriele Paulie, on the Free Voter candidate, used the Huber-Beckstein duo to perform the coup, but then mercilessly short the process with an ambitious local politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, Stoiber, who has been spinning strings from behind, has also been called by the former prime minister of the country and by the former president of the CSU on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some nasty remarks to the CDU, according to him they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag on September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless CSU, which played a major role in the national success of 2005, somehow gets back on its feet together.
According to Merkel, who had difficulty hiding her disappointment because of the fiasco, CSU’s loss of positions would not have a negative impact on Berlin’s great coalition.
This is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU, and the social democrat crisis will continue.
The SPD has achieved 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
In the Sunday elections, not a single opposition MP made it to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained by Russian observers by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the illegalities that occurred during the census.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million-dollar country has lacked opposition well for ten years, the opposition, combined under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections, had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, following the amendment to the constitution in the 2006 elections, had the fourth time to renew his presidential mandate, this time "will" allow several opposition MPs to appear in Parliament.
The ODS thus dropped even the previously considered boycott.
In the background of opposition expectations, it was that Belarus was increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which wished to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to Belarus' political establishment rated as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians did not receive entry permits - to mitigate the impact of the ever-expensive Russian gas import.
The release earlier pointed out that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, had placed emphasis on positive shifts and not on shortcomings - such as the ban on candidacy for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, Monday's flash report by the OSCE already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were basically unable to appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present with a census.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in small confrontations with Moscow, while continuing to refuse to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia separated from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has considered these two territories to have been independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to remain so, despite the fact that "she was too afraid to go into a meaningless parliament by a single member of the opposition".
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, but distribution is hindering the local authorities, but I can still see that more and more people are supporting change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest success, does not see the right or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'inducing the silence of the cemetery' collapses," says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian observers considered elections democratic.
The Head of Mission of the Community of Independent States Sergei Lebedev to the Russian news agency Ria Novasti said that "people do not believe in words but actions", so the absence of opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
This is the first time in Chigi Palace history that a revolving door was introduced on the arrival and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new measure will begin to work against the cunning people, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee during working hours.
News against lazy people was introduced today by Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving door - Brunetta says - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services", states the Minister.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will open.
This is about reformism", points out Brunetta.
With Chigi Palace, we will complete the introduction in all the Council Presidency buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from the employees, the Secretary-General states: "It was a common procedure with the staff and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister will eventually announce that within three months, the absence of public workers for the disease has decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more people per year at work".
And it will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"Its payout dynamic – explained by the Minister – has doubled in the last 8-10 years due to the private sector and is much higher than the inflation percentage."
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees met to reject the Brunette Decree standards in accordance with the Codacons-backed application.
"While the Minister for Public Administration today presents figures relating to the lower absence of work due to illness – writes the Consumer Protection Association – a nation of 'drinking lazy people' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public administration employees gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree".
Tara will be particularly protested against the exclusion of sick pay, which depends on the activity; the extension of the time within which the sick person can be checked for inspection visits and other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Resolut prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur, three people die, and 27 people remain permanently disabled.
Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths due to accidents at work.
These values show the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the deaths compared to murders.
In order to re-invigorate institutions, social and informational resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Accidents in all Italian regions, set on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of labour safety", confirms the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Mutilated and Disability for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his vivid admiration for the constant joint effort to protect the injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion."
"Naturally, outraged 'enough' has been raised, honestly shared in the face of tragedies which, by their scope, create a stir in the media and public opinion, but the daily reality once again offers dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that 'there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Many of the initiatives put forward in the field of education are of particular importance so that young people facing the world of work become more aware.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social importance, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber pointed out, "how the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social situation, as it offends the conscience of each one of us and forces all institutions to make convincing efforts towards the necessary termination of this situation."
"As regards the data of accidents at work, they seem to show a positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from accidents at work is alarming anyway", said President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We wouldn't exactly want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because right when the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that in general there is still little to be done to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - Mercandelli emphasised - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the area of training workers, right from the school age".
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public opinion participation.
But the main thing is to have a greater sense of responsibility from employers to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli finally stated that this was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation foreseen for work victims and "delegation of support care", to which the system has come in recent years."
"The goal is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifts from time to time by the legislator".
Mp3 Player accused, putting hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music instruments as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission announcement published today, which quotes in an official report published in Brussels the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which has recently arisen and been identified (Cserseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion – we read in notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years with portable musical instruments, a week more than an hour a day and keep the machine at high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who use often portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way", admits Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings – the leader continues – indicate a clear risk and need to respond quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine the already existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them fully effective and to keep up with the new technology'.
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists – closed down the executive official Eu – confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission, along with the other members and parties that have raised the problem, will examine what measures could possibly be implemented to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices."
At present, there is a safety European standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise are increasing.
It is possible to greatly limit these damage by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, exceed the limits currently in force corresponding to maximum permitted workplace noise.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk lasting loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices, and their number can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission run its course for the future of the capital
We'll start today, close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital City of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and its councilman Gianni Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to emphasise Alemanno – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political arbitrators, which remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
This is not about any exchange of functions, but just about trying to have some place to work on a big project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then disbanded, because this institution must have an exact deadline.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
To the one who accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will say: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as Attali's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
All too often, politics spreads over everyday problems and the urgency that occurs from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to stress that 'this Commission is neither a useless enterprise nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens even the euro and will serve to reflect and involve the best intelligence the capital has'.
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor stationary, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level it urgently needs, and to think of its future with a united spirit."
A future that, specifically, the mayor of Rome 'will not only be confined to the current municipal borders, but will look much further' not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but 'will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean'.
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as a private citizen today) with the enemy of Islam".
The attacks against Obama are rising just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami posted on the website: "This guy is full of ambition.
But Obama has the nerve: he thinks he will get to the highest position of the nation, who had all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then we have surveys; everyone says that Obama will win and with a big head start.
Even in this case, there are those who act on the heart and not the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the bowels of the South of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling booth, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
There's a side of American mentality that remains soaring until the very last moment.
Say what you want, eventually we'll take care of it ourselves, who to tick, Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: What mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty - nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became, for most of Bush's weakness.
Who will take the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The US economic collapse was felt by journalists as well: there is an investigation period in the newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say that they had less to worry about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
Money is the problem for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis in the economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the paper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists asked, this is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists of press and executive seniors believe that journalism on a national scale is taking the wrong path.
There's an executive group in the local area at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, which many view as "killer" printed matter.
"Economic pressure", which journalists point out, increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists interviewed admitted that they were resorting to technology in the hope that they would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who manage newsrooms – that is, leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "work security."
Leaders who think they're going to lose their jobs in three years are 47% national.
As far as the press is concerned, they're at 30%.
With regard to "sure work" regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on a daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a vast nation as Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so the question is to take or leave.
Managers receive almost always huge salaries, and the editor can earn $10,000 a month outside of pension and insurance.
As far as vacations are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: THE TRIAL IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYING IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of Daniel Coppola's real estate entrepreneur, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the counteroffer for the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense he received a home arrest release last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate entrepreneur could change the place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he expressed himself) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that blames him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon became apparent a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan presented to the White House: a large part of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is also confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is tearing apart the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, milder, accommodating to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to "those from Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South states.
A soul that was arrogantly manifested by the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this very thing is merely an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but in the whole West, and perhaps not just here.
In both Usa and Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time in the new climate, which are hardening and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is re-update, exceptional market recovery, double category State-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis at the bank of financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country are included, in a single state.
At the same time, this created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be world economic, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political interethnicism seems to be substantially out of the picture or that it has little to add: the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and different state strategies, has given obvious evidence and cannot decide on one common political line.
So everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the recovery of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: when we are in distress, only the states have economic means, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And they also possess the necessary means and powers to use them: two resources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have to have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis puts on a national element, is in complete harmony with the ever-increasing importance of which the latest economic advances are trying to attribute to one factor closely linked to it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom of Sita, increasingly sophisticated technology, and material, while we were convinced that global finance had already been destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little material things as water, grain, diesel.
All things that would have said could be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the bounded space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up his sleeve than who isn't and who's unlucky enough to live in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it predicts a turning point.
Whoever talks about territory, state, government, inevitably talks about politics, i.e. leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, awareness that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can take on the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leaders, especially economic ones, which proved equally inconvenient and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, alarming: discreditation, impatience, incompetence, and absence, which seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For it seems that their beliefs are growing in the vast masses of the population, rather than their actions being the same as those of the so far popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from underground, but the strong movement to eliminate ruling classes and traditional political order is manifested in the sudden electoral "refoulements" or in the unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of Labour in the UK, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also has something to do with it).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, have ever greater problems to understand, i.e. represent, which, not from now on, is created in deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially too shabby.
Before this it would be excessive to talk about a permanent 'mass revolt'.
But I'm sure we can't say that means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on walls
Beat the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep a stokilogram body stuck on a vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American magazine Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing, which use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf pipe.
«The basis of glue can be seen as a series of pipes laid down as an arranged pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of gecko covered in microscopic hairs that allow the animal to have a perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "is simply detached from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at Dayton University Engineering School.
"This material could be useful as provisional glue" will deliver Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aeronautical space engineering .
No super heroes for now.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also involved in research into new glue.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented microfiber-shaped glue as hair that cleanses itself from dust by moving around the surface to maintain perfect attachment.
Medications: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the amplification or decrease in efficacy with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, to highlight the risks of juices both ready and fresh in combination with the ingestion of some drugs, at the current 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, it raises a new alarm: just one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects, and to expose patients to risk health.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arithmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines, and neurologic drugs, except for toxic levels.
PRACTICES AT RISK– The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in the newsletter two years ago and encouraged doctors and patients not to underestimate the risks arising from the mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medication, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
From there Michele Carruba's call, director of the Pharmacology Department of Milan State University: "These discoveries are usually immediately announced to various international and national pharmacies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions on medications.
So always read the illustrative list of medicines you receive and if you encounter anything unclear, do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» stressed an expert for Ansa.
Nobel for Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in foreign, economic and political action by the Bush administration.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, on the days of Enron’s collapse, Krugman predicted in a comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be much more important than the first, in terms of the consequences of the history of the United States.
A prediction that caused a few polemics and that has been reproached for years, but which proved accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which the collapse such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Central European Bank Executive Committee, Krugman is a "economics of great importance", but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, especially critical of Bush's liberalist administration's excesses".
Open Office, we have a third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production, which aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work by volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows up to the general public with various innovations: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window, additional, much more substantial, such as compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and support of the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open a document with the new Microsoft file extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Special features of some models are interesting, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility of transferring PDF folder into the graphic design model and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have spreadsheet processor or text program properties.
Cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: it is possible to work together in excellence between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each coworker is assigned one colour to comment to make the identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should re-assemble the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, which has been added to the English version, which has been on mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for Linux operating system.
The installation cd can also be sent home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the theme of freeness can be a draw to expansion in households, it is the business area that the Open Office package has a lot of stakes, and it can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the release of a new version it is possible that this assumed number can be overcome.
Also Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and top-class T-shirt winner.
The message was quoted by the pages of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Cere, Epo third generation, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples belong to those carried out in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positivity of the Cere, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the determined two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positive third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already reported the results of the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Saster and American Cadel Evansem, also won a punt T-shirt of the best climber.
Imigrants:NEW YORK TIMES IS ITALIA RASIST?
Italy 'as a country of emigrants only in the last house has turned into a priority target for immigrants' adopted with opposition.
Is it turning a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So they ask in a long article in the New York Times, which devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and they started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times define as the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are also those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by Legou, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinala, asked the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, a union for tenants, rent a single room a student can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that whole layers of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear – explains Sunia's head of study, Laura Mariani – in this town, the large demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has stimulated the process of rising prices, which has spread to residents as well."
In most cases rent offers contain several offenses: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, associated with subleases.
Sunja needs exceptional intervention, which could regulate prices through the revision of taxes.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for about 450 euros per bed, a single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (bande Nere zone) to the mean value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to the maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, you need 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in double bed.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples there is a bed of 300/450 euros, a room of 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones of Poliqulinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want EUR 250/350 per bed, at least 350 per single room.
Prices are definitely lower in smaller cities, but they have a greater impact on the citizens' economy.
In cities like Perugia, where rent is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, one other anomaly is finally noted: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students compared to Italian students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historical halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is as blind as a face without eyes."
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multisals in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central zones of cities is one of events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of genuine cultural crime.
Often historical places with memories disappear," it is as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a journey and a lot of emotion», the director of the New Paradise Cinema, a film that won Tornator Oscar and the great jury prize in Cannes 20 years ago, and who told poetry of a village cinema and sadness about the way the cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 cinemas closed the traditional tip, and the highest account was paid mainly by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torino, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures is Emilia-Romagna with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the onset of a multiplex, these three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinema multisals: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romana.
«The Italian procedure has evolved irrationally» claims Paolo Protti, President of Anecu," it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema closes in the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the under-subsidisation of the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous government debt is around 10 million euro.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a disgrace that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would take between 16 million and 18 million euros a year to support the sector».
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find the starting point by signing a protocula between the village and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax relief in favour of operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to drive into a zone with limited transport and will have special prices to stop and at some car parks.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is more demanding.
Defense of the traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a spark that convinced me to establish the "New cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotion that I do not have to look at signs blackened with dust, I turn to the other side».
The connection between politics and the mafia group 'ndrangheta, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to modify the elections of the city council according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group".
The charges that the Directorate against the Mafia in Calabria raise against the mayor and Vice Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrioe e Rosario Schiavon, and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the mafia organization, are difficult.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the boss's namesake, accused of committing crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards as well as common sense", writes the prosecutors, when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"That would enable the mafia group – written by judges – to officially enter the city authorities and thus facilitate the already huge possibilities of controlling and managing the public administration".
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal underworld are a lot in his region: "There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndranghets, heroes who are still spotless'.
This morning's imprisonment follows the imprisonment of July last year, by which the police showed that the Mafia Piromalli group had received a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the Gioii Tauro City Council has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for this was the supposed link between organised crime and local administration - the local politicians were deprived of their office in municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the moment of dissolution was elected head of the right-center coalition after a narrower election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti's responsibility and accused him of plotting everything for political reasons, but the judges in the prison order signed this morning explain that the mafia group had even grown so far as to ask for a change in the A3 motorway project.
Further interrogations directed against Dal Torrio, written by public prosecutors, revealed "the willingness to move the claims of an entrepreneur, representatives of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromallim and to adapt the elections to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It is an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface and is now being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are the new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of colossals like Chevron cling, who are now trying to reach these sources.
The ability to generate energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years and in the 1970s, in the context of the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price went down around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away, but now the environmental organization and the new oil price increase gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
this amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centers.
Plus there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
The company that put money on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more societies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron studies ocean energy technology – a spokesman for a company that is connected to the United States oil colossus, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal – has expressed himself thinking about the possibility of working with us".
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the marine energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to mine oil and recently President Bush has come up with a new drilling plan.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show increasing interest, according to observers.
The technology that needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology that is still in the early stages, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
In the meantime, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, more-impacted technologies must be used on the diluent.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are linked to each other.
The power of waves that moves with buoys up and down is changed using cylinders and tops to hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
Pressure spins the turbine, which delivers energy to the generator.
The power's coming to shore with underwater cables.
So far, there are four facilities of this type at the project stage, which are only waiting for federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already generating energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six Pdmora turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during the tide and tide causes the turbines to rotate, which feed the generator through this rotating movement.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
At this point, special interest deserves the potential of the tide, they say at the Institute for Research on Electric Energy.
Although this is an incoherent factor, the tides and tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in the energy of the influx and outflow that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.50 million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
