Inflation in Europe has jumped because of food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, annual inflation was registered 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, reported by the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, reported by Bloomberg.
Unlike US, British, and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the basic interest rate, with the decrease in raw material prices and falling unemployment leading to an inflation spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below 2%, but close to it.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a preposterous situation: it must 'serve' inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 percent of a 15-year record; in Spain it then rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has skyrocketed due to rising food and energy prices.
The term wheat prices have risen by 88 percent, as well as the soy exchange rate has reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007, it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The world market price has risen by 52 percent this year, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will shift from 2.1% to 2.5% this year in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double the interest rates during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The Fidesz group of supporters of the Fidesz movement increased significantly after the prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of Socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured such low - 13 percent support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two thirds (71 percent) of support compared to one fifth of support for MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for accession to Parliament: their support throughout the population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has deteriorated even in view of the previous minimum - the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad has never been so high - 41 per cent, while the other 46 per cent says the situation is rather bad.
Families evaluate the change in their material situation after spring and summer more promising prospects now again more pessimistic.
As far as next year is concerned, more of the population is counting on further deterioration and only a tenth of the population is counting on improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the respondents judged, most of all of the Gallopa Institute's researches so far, that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsány believes or believes very much 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the supporters.
The Prime Minister has no trust in 54 percent, the president of the Fidesz movement, 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While after last October’s riots, the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister felt it desirable to remain 35 percent, this share is now only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in launching new elections.
It is typical of the interest in a referendum that 60 percent of the respondents answered the question regarding their possible participation that it would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
In comparison, the 'parliamentary elections held this Sunday' would certainly only take part in 55 percent and another 15 percent would consider their participation likely.
The tuition would say no to 74, medical fees 79, and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people who are certainly promising their participation, 81, 84 and 89 percent would reject the introduction of tuition fees, medical fees, and hospital fees.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost one-fifth lowered Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangle have maintained last year's, on average, 16 percent increase in price levels, with the difference that VAT did not increase this year.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs business triangle increased by 16 percent on average this year, but in all hypermarkets there was a price increase of over a thousand forints.
Since prices in supermarkets of food have already "exploded" in December last year, there was not much drastic increase due to the earlier high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that they will not buy what they could buy at a price of less than 9,000 forints last year at a price of less than ten thousand.
The daily economy consumption basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
Unica's price and live fish remained at almost last year's level, but they very much undercut cruel breasts, nuts and poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found kilogram bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not go below 200 forints with the price of the product.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of two-litre Coca Cola in a refundable bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the deposit was only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the consumer basket, Napi Gazdaság Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket increased by 15 in relation to last year's Cora prices, while Tesco and Auchan increased by approximately 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and this year's lowest value of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In Forints, there was an average increase of 1 480.
The average price increase last year came to 1 206 forints, with prices being affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It is this process that has disrupted trade that the department of commerce has clearly failed to decide how large the price ranges for individual products are to be determined, as they have not been able to predict the effect the price change will have on consumption.
(If the trader plans wrongly the rate of circulation of the product, it may lose significant profit due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of the circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket was so extremely high that the price of the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest price difference was 844 forints.
This year the extreme difference did not manifest itself, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest one undercut by 1 284 forints.
Compared to both Christmas seasons, disastrous price growth has been revealed, and in less than 20 months, daily goods in hypermarkets have been undercut by more than 30 percent.
(This is not entirely confirmed, among other things, by the Central Statistical Office's data: it has measured an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in the course of 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the daily economy’s consumer basket, it seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed barely 10 % of price growth, given the base even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be taking stronger positions than egg suppliers, and they managed to enforce drastic price increases in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the business gold triangle don't complain, they still report on a good year.
In our experience, most customers in three visited shops no longer care about prices.
They buy everything out of quantity, they take durable foods at their wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets had long queues at the cash desks, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, rural turnover is lower, several international chains complain to research firms that revenues lag behind their plans, not only in the case of food but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places they save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hospital hygiene conditions, bed overcrowding, overburdens of personnel do not help with disease control, claims the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many places also save money on disinfectants.
Recently, the trauma department of St. John's Hospital has been diagnosed with MRSA infection.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who got into the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient's been isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria found in his organism there could not be one important operation.
By 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents were reported to the Nesocomialis Surveillance National System, said Karolina Böröczová, the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents have been safely registered in hospitals, others are not known.
Almost two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methhicillin-oxacillin resistant to gold staphylococci.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry a third of the people in their nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsilitis, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, when antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, they develop a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics that is very resistant to antibiotics and that spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, in the case of temporary or permanent poor functioning of the immune system in patients with weakened organism, low body weight or in patients over the years, serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning, may cause sepsis.
According to the chief physician at St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are among the daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the disease agent is not investigated."
Resisting Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, care personnel treat them in rubber gloves, and mask, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined for presence in their MRSA organism, but infection is not always avoided.
Sampling is not in mode
Most hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favourable for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant disease agents, claims Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection is typically found in hospitals and homes for elderly people, hospitals should immediately control the patients admitted and isolate MRSA carriers.
However, the collection of microbiological samples is not in the fashion of Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations also plays a role.
Most cases are revealed when the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also home guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
In order to avoid drug resistance, antibiotic therapy should be targeted, or microbiological tests should be carried out, but hospitals do not follow this in all cases.
The collection of microbiological samples is even more rare for basic and outpatient treatment, as reported by Karolina Böröczová.
Saved for disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most often through medical personnel.
This is why washing hands and using gloves and masks play a very important role, but even in hospitals there are serious shortcomings.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection and touch, but in the conditions of home hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
The rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately we can also see that in hospitals that are in an unfavourable material situation, they save on disinfectants, there are few caregivers and many patients, thus increasing the chances of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are being observed, similar infections are demonstrably less likely or further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA, or to reduce its occurrence.
The program appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistent disease agents (including MRSAs), respectively hospital infections caused by these disease agents, among its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official expert report in the case of police captain XXII. district, which caused a fatal accident, is complete.
It can be excluded that the police captain of the XXII. district, who killed pedestrians on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his post, managed under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, informed the spokesperson of the Attorney General of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert opinion of the case was completed.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain had not taken any alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The former director of the XXII Police Directorate hit Lajos Kossuth Street on Tuesday in the XXII Circuit with his own personal car at the turn of a 55-year-old man who entered before him when crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The last mentioned fact that the pedestrian passed away from the zebra, after all, according to the rules of road traffic there is no extenuating circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After transport to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police director resigned and applied for retirement, according to police reports, because he was so shaken up by the case.
He's conducting an investigation into the Budapest State Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain has been cooperating with prosecutors conducting investigations since the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
On Friday in Budapest, the Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed an agreement on three credit frameworks worth EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects implemented under the support of the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having already concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the Treaty now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Also, the EUR 150 million loan agreement is used for the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which will be used primarily for the research-development project of the University of Debrecín.
At the meeting there was also a talk about the 4th metro line.
The Parties agree that, once Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original agreement needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of EUR 8.4 billion of 113 projects in Hungary.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and no commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to a previously neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is still shopping in the cheapest yet rapidly expensive EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore, is now the most sought-after Eastern European objective of real estate purchases.
The most of the mountains are in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will be aroused sooner or later by investors, and more and more interested people will also buy in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
The capital city of Sofia is also a promise of attractive possibilities, business and office premises promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best course to turn into one of Europe's most attractive golf havens, making itself next to the summer and winter season a popular destination for trips in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are already buying in bulk, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers at the Black Sea and in ski havens.
Foreign buyer climb into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth 50-100,000 euros, or dilapidated old houses worth 5-15,000 euros, which are then renovated.
They require good accessibility and communication, and the proximity of a large city, shops, and, as a rule, a local doctor is important to them.
The second category are chat buyers (Bulgaria was ranked among the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of an increase in value in the medium or long term.
Real estate management in the capital is continuous, as demand is getting stronger.
While the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are in Bulgaria, they have increased by 21 percent annually over the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices significantly exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and Hungarian 6 percent
According to information from the Minister of the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, the meetings of experts will be closed on Tuesday and after the official opening of Wednesday, the international conference on the climate regime will continue after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Travel Map, which addresses efforts following the period of emission reduction as defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At this point, there is a heated debate between developing and advanced countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not want to discuss precise figures now, although they are inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020, given the 1990 status.
Another major issue of the conference is whether advanced countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also agree to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that rely on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member Governing Board, most likely within the framework of the World Environmental Protection Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the Piac és Profit magazine.
Hungarian 6 percent
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in efforts to protect the global climate and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990, independently of the success of adopting the post-2012 'agreement', and is prepared to commit to a reduction of up to 30% if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments appropriate to their capabilities.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set the target of a 5.2 percent reduction, with 15 EU Member States making an 8 percent commitment.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfil. - It is mentioned in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
Bali is a big deal, because an international agreement on long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly not be postponed until 2012. In such a case, a new emission reduction system would not immediately follow up on the reduction commitments set by the Kyoto Protocol, the need for which the UN International Climate Change Scientific Council has also pointed out in its latest report - the IPCC, a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military forces are posting video-sharing videos from events in Iraq and Afghanistan that make themselves popular.
First, YouTube became popular with the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, announced by the BBC.
Recordings, taken by a miniature camera mounted on a helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Headquarters, controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable.
By this form, 139 recordings of British air force soldiers have already been made on the Internet, and over 75,000 people have already looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarterers" and publishes recordings from events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Air Force released videos according to their original intention to recruit and according to the Ministry of Defence are good to familiarize the general public with the real goal of the presence of an army abroad.
"Promotion published in this form compared to traditional TV recruitment advertising costs almost nothing," said the BBC defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it necessarily carries a political message, as it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made a game.
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully modified, censored recordings, amateur videos are also available on the server, including the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers are talking at most about losses, but there is no bloody form of combat.
After all, many videos from the fighting grounds in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released on the Internet, which was created in a sharp deployment, but the British army has only just found out about them.
Americans recruit slightly differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through a more or less faithful simulation get directly into the skin of the soldiers.
There's gonna be Christmas with raffle and pags at the ministries.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her colleagues, at which she will say goodbye to pags and coffee in 2007.
Some ministries will have a celebration with live music, elsewhere they will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere with a raffle and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - so enjoy the powerful.
The state authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will hold the most expensive Christmas celebration this year, but it does not expect its employees.
At Christmas orphans will receive gifts from children of fallen soldiers, during the Missional Christmas meal family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will kick themselves out of the dome as compared to other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and of 600 employees of the Ministry, approximately 300 guests are expected.
The resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and also a raffle will be drawn.
Christmas NFÜ cost 4 700 000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Justice Council (OIT) - on the program were concerts and dinners.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than 400 invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: a tender company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG), will organise it from EU money.
For this purpose they rented the building of the Vigszínház Theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we were unable to reach the relevant person.
There's no need for a suit.
The OIT building was not only hosted by NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized the St.Lucia Ball instead of Christmas on December 7.
But the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began with a greeting minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball were not obligatory evening dress or suit at all.
The Puritan party is being arranged by the health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a program and a celebration for 400,000 forint employees in its own building.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is not even officially inviting her coworkers to a Christmas party, but to a final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department, only get coffee and pags, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas meeting, where 436 employees are expected to attend, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party he devotes 2 500 forints to the guest - the total amount includes a reception with buffets and a toast.
Since János Veres is Minister, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party, however, will be missing, officiality increases not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time.
The Agriculture Resort organizes a New Year's reception on January 20, and ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in the Vajdahunyadvár castle in the City Orchards and according to the Ministry's communication for a hundred guests 1,000 forints per person.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions start with a short greeting minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the [origo] portal was communicated by the relevant press departments.
They were unable to announce the award of Christmas celebrations to the Environment Department in the press department.
In any case, 400 people were invited to a party at the Museum of Arts.
There's a giant strike coming up.
The League Union of Trade Unions, respectively the National Workers' Council Union (MOSZ) will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's time-limited strike.
On Saturday there is a protest public assembly, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious interruptions of transport, as railway transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga association will meet the National Workers' Council Union with details of the jointly organized Monday's strike.
There will also be a strike committee LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate the action on Monday.
There is a protest public assembly on Saturday, and from Monday the unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that there was no deadline for the strike to end, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if the legislation is voted on, strike committees will meet to decide on the next step.
It is also possible, according to the Monday's agenda for Parliament's meeting, that the Health Insurance Act will not be voted until late evening or late night.
Due to Monday's start of the strike, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: work on the railway will be stopped indefinitely, some of Budapest's public transport and more than half of Volán companies may stop in the morning.
At the same time, half of the track will also be closed in many places in the country.
Many trade unions and civil organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the League website, have joined the strike call.
Some organizations have announced a strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary stop to work.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, while more and more people travel on the railway at the beginning of Christmas holidays.
According to previous communications, there will be a strike at BKV from the beginning of operation until 13.00, from 7 am to 9 am at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organised by the Divisional Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry of LIGA, calling for a 2- or 2-8-hour halt of work to be called upon by the Departmental Union of Teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers.
The Association of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), belonging to the Co-operation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), organizes a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League association is that the government withdraw the proposal for a reform of health insurance and present a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions should be introduced gradually starting next year.
Third, in order to ensure that early retirement for the relevant fields of work can be included in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZZ), falling under the Liga trade union, does not accept the Ministry of Economy and Transport's offer concerning railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased country risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of Jobbik Magyarszágért in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in several respects.
The "risk warning" drawn up by the company states: in connection with the Hungarian Guard's activities, the greatest political risk is that "the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roma populations of Hungary may be exacerbated by violent ethnic clashes in a short time".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such an action - supplied by the research institute.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the biggest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: 'public debate on the Roma issue was left to representatives of public life of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict'.
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the Institute judges.
In addition, according to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard's activities were "to a large extent corrupted the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have been getting ever more publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, is that several organizations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007, which are called "national militias" themselves.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defence tasks (in the event of natural disasters, assault of their homeland, disruption of order), plus pointing to the inability of the police, army, or state," he adds.
He further notes: all this is happening in a way that seeks to wrap up various political efforts based on the opposition of society to politics and parties into civilian robes.
Therefore, emphasising civility and the form of association in the case of these groupings is not only designed to avoid legal difficulties in judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also a risk-enhancing factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard is being referred to in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, and ultra-nationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policy by appealing to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guards in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so political risks to the area as a whole have increased.
As he writes, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard there are mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
She used this BNU to set up a guard, saying that the organization's goal is "national militia".
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, recalling the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative has sparked a heated debate between the Bulgarian public.
As he further writes, the increased risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guards as a sign of resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard's current activity is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even Hungarian Romani people will respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read in the warning of the risks created by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute, told the press office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue risk analyses every year and, if they find anything that might affect risk change, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk alert.
Holidays are not available everywhere
In Hungary, days of leave are precisely laid down by law and it has already become a general practice that working days are moving around the holidays, which is less likely to happen next year.
In the European Union and in America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and days of rest.
The days of serenity are usually linked to church holidays or to significant historical events.
We also celebrate New Year with us: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is work leave - on New Year's Eve so that people can relax after New Year's.
In the course of the year, we have 11 holidays available.
The National Festival is 15 March celebrating the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day Easter, Pentecost and Christmas holidays.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays are rarely for the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move the day of work in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price for extended weekends is that the previous Saturday we stay in the workplace and in school.
The day immediately preceded or followed by the festival will be worked out by the Minister of Labour for many years in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to public employees and to persons in public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, in view of their designation, operate even in the days of rest.
This year, there will be a change in the working order only around the end of the year: life in the country will almost stop from December 24, because according to previous experience, most people will "work" or take advantage of the holiday saved in advance between Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Next year, several of our holidays fall into the middle, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be transformed around the holiday of work so that the workers can stay home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, may, on the contrary, can be a rest day.
The next movement is related to the festival on 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will be working instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year, however, will be able to take place completely in the sign of the holidays, because from 24 December they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays even though New Year ́s Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six scary little things that can upset your colleagues.
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we hardly notice anymore: all of this "enhances" weekdays in the workplace.
The question is, do you get used to these little inconveniences or do you put on gloves and vague situations that might upset others, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that the marketing department was looking for you," a colleague will tell you.
That you missed the meeting for this?
In the better case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to deliver the message (that is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's a matter of one apology.
Before it comes to embarrassing apologies, it is good to think about how you could prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues, knowingly trying to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than reaching out for a document, office use, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table of one of your colleagues your pens that you thought were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll be right to be mad at you for going through their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or adhesives from your office, as they may be unpleasant if you run out of them prematurely, and you will need them immediately.
Rumors about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop rumors.
Who, who, what did he do with?
Where and why?
Do not hang on everyone's nose your reports about the private life of your colleagues!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse their trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even if others know about his things.
You're reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and, referring to a severe headache, report your absence because you are not feeling well, or think that you would rather rest today, think that your work, the urgent tasks and the work they have a certain term will have to be done for you by someone else.
Pay attention to your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will require you to stay home, please report that your colleagues and leaders will not be confronted with your absence the next day.
Grouching, giggling, phone calls
Did you dive into a job that's going to rip you out of your co-workers' giggles?
Did you inadvertently witness a phone conversation that would be better to not hear at all?
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming, chanting, talking loudly (over their heads), or stomping, constantly curtsy, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disruptive even if they are not involved in some project (written, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If something is not on time or you forget to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness.
Do not refer to any chaos in the office and deaf colleagues!
Admit it if you've made mistakes and someone's paid for it, and make amends!
Ask how you could fix things, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in your office?
Teaks and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not suitable for office!
Don't wear leisure clothes even if your profession allows it!
Don't be negligent, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in a common dress - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When you want to be comfortable, you're no longer interesting.
Driving around in the usual morning traffic.
A special melody will be heard from the radio: the sound of the violin to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes pace and bass is added to the previous tone coloring, then a female choir joins itself as a real jewel.
There's a song by Zagar called Wings of Love at the mr2 station.
For a long time, home music has not spoiled us with quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the traffic looks quite different because you're listening to the new Zagara album.
The Yonderboi apparition, a few new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the picture, and although it is again in the fashion of garage rock with its beat-up guitar, even home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five-Selt and he also played in Yonderboi's band until finally - perhaps because two pacifiers can't fit in one row - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he started to break through only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ference Török "Szezon").
His formations, playing in the beginnings of smaller clubs, met a wider audience after the magazine wan2 ranked their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important home albums and declared Zagar in Yonderboie to be almost the only domestic leaders determining the development that could be sold even in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "on course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded as it belonged: it made a new, better album.
Now released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new ways for them, although the name itself tries to create continuity with initial flights in the Five-Story.
This is one verse from the composition of the old band Balázs Zságer.
Reference to ethereal, flying would be appropriate, but next to the ethereal touch of this music has now appeared - in harmony with the spirit, trend of the time - louder guitar, influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, a singer named György Ligeti, currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, presented himself at the premiere of the Millennials Park album.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the Petőfi station, which has been playing popular music lately from morning to evening, we started to enjoy the fluttering tunes of Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is fine (?).
The portal hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, there is a question of how much of what you play remains marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music means little to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only be made for sale, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can come from an honest inner need.
In this spirit, there is also a position as adopted, independently of the language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a bigger tradition.
Not only teenagers and 20-year-olds go to concerts there, but older ones too.
They follow much more the transformations of light music around them, because they also regard it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who listens to your music, where and in how many times?
B. Zs.: Of course it feels good that more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more in concerts where mutual influence is already working, but it is hidden only in the indiscriminate transformations of the moment.
Yet I noticed that when one wants to please the audience, from that moment on, it stops being interesting.
hvg.hu: How far are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works solo and built his career more west of us.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, regardless of the fact that sometimes they try to explain our music.
We're more like team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let it evolve.
At first, of course, we could not avoid our work not comparing Yonderboi to Yonderboi songs, for several of us separated from his band and went another way.
hvg.hu: The song Wings of Love came first in the toplist of mr2 Petőfi station.
Many first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
In a more popular way, you deliberately opened up to the wider layers?
B.Z.: We didn't plan on writing a hit to sell a record to.
There's more to that song.
We intended it as the album finale, by which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the guiding principle?
B.Z.: The idea was to create such gospel choir.
Then came the idea to assemble this choir from the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir came together - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized on the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls make something about it?
B.Z.: The song has long existed in an instrumental version, when the material was gathered on the record, we thought that there would be something else to this song.
A sequence of chords tempted the singing part to join him.
The other night, I sang a melody to him that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost the first time, and it was so spontaneous.
I remember how it revived, but, of course, it took Wonders.
It wouldn't work that vigorously with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and on the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They don't have solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They also stood on the stage in the back.
Is that on purpose?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only because of technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we did not want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even that song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where everyone's from, where they belong, and just letting those wings, love wings rise up.
I wanted this euphoric state that we felt when that song was born to be felt by others.
hvg.hu: Which one was the most busy with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of the music actually not one, harder pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for long, then everything slowly found its place in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Z.: That's still changing with the concert and the fact that I've already released the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions of inferiority
A treachery defraudant.
This is what the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the domestic Komerční banke, calls Jerome Kerviel, a former employee.
She lost almost five billion euros because of him.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compete with his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent the police after him.
But, as Kerviel’s statement, which was made by French media, such as Le Monde, was a person who, at the end of last year, had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros on the American crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that the so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or to those who had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis did not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet it right.
At the end of the year, its profits went up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," admits Kerviel, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything for himself.
All through the interrogation, he admits that he faked the records so he wouldn't be found out.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his business.
The risk was profit.
Was he afraid he'd be found out?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to work his way up to his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from Lyon University.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he'd never make as much money as anyone else.
"At my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also my professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he was betting half a billion euros in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he said to the police.
But they said the bosses knew everything, or rather they suspected.
"As long as I was making money, they were closing their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After the weekend of mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out about him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want anyone looking into his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to gain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately CZK 365 billion).
It is about half the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around CZK 100 billion from the Business and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to traffic.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will be running with CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and businesses to raise funds for innovative business.
Companies should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful in drawing money from EU funds so far within the newly accepted countries.
A 20-year sentence for an ex-president of Nicaragua has been confirmed by a court of law
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed a 20-year sentence for the former president of Arnold Aleman’s country, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (almost CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 goes back to prison, the AP says it's not clear at the moment.
According to Ileana Pérez, President of the Court of Appeal, it will now be up to prison officials whether they let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he was regularly moving government money into accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Aleman founded on financing his election campaign in 2001.
That's how they approved the budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without opposition support.
He passed last year with the support of the ČSSD, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford not to accept him.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote on government mistrust, nothing dramatic was happening this time.
The Chamber of Deputies approved this traditionally overlooked, although most influential, law in peace.
It's a kind of paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of the government with the opposition.
This is more media grateful and therefore he pays much more attention to it in the media.
Arguing politicians is much more interesting to the public than a few figures.
The state budgets in past Social Democratic governments suffered from three ills, which for 2008 are suddenly unable to resolve:
The first is a high share of the law of mandatory, so-called mandatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalition" ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first malaise.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
But the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It's public and relatively controlled.
But the time bomb is the deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to their tax, tax, and credit money from banks, often recklessly issue bonds that disproportionately indebtedly to their city hall.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other grids that they received from the state in privatisation.
They don't have that source anymore.
If we just stick to official and verifiable facts, we'll find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, and this constantly boasts of the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state was increasingly in debt.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
It is a huge shame that falls primarily on the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have in recent years been completely unnecessaryly bulging into gigantic proportions.
Although part of the senseless populist spending approved this year before the elections has managed to be abolished, if there is not a shift in the retirement and pension reform border in the near future, then any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever rules it will be mere office.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the displacement of normal expenditures through mandatorical expenditures.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not managed their best in the last ten years.
If we do not really want to see ruling politicians become mere officials, then we must be patient and give this not-so-strong coalition government, which realises that the state can only give as much as it can get on taxes and charges, peace to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland, and Canada have decided together to combat the financial market crisis.
This will bring more than $100 billion to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank auctions the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion, then make the next 24 available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is after the 9/11 attacks for the first time that the national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the economy's biggest problems, the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," said Bernard Bausol, of the consultancy company Economic Outlook Group, in his report to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the chance of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Bausol added in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion because of unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting more billions of losses.
"Central banks must be really worried about what else might follow when they decided to do this," said the chief economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks decided to do so after the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used to lend money to the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada, and Britain decreased their interest rates several times during autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another interest rate decline," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting to Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank’s move will contribute to averting the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Environmental debates are incredible.
Global climate change is intended to damage developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now come to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he said that environmental debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which makes up a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that follows it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President emphasized that her topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so involved with them.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book appears in the German translation because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinions".
So now the students can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to observe and judge expert papers, has experience with statistics and is also a nationalist.
The main conclusions of the book were that the climate was constantly changing and changes were normal, that there was no consistent view of the warming of the planet by all scientists, that the consequences of the changes now were not too great and serious and therefore not a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development were unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a man with experience of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver's license didn't change 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to change their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange to be issued by the authorities by the end of the year with a new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would go on the road after the New Year without a valid license.
According to the authorities, they didn't exchange their ID, especially those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of licences, the authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed by requests and interest in the exchange of licences has increased this week.
The Magistrate checks in around 2000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour of waiting in the queues.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
It takes 20 days to issue a new license.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In that case, however, the driver will pay an extra 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the mandatory exchange by the end of the year and leave the road without a valid driver’s license will be subject to a fine from January onwards.
The wrongdoer will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But a police officer can also deal with a misdemeanor by arrangement.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will rise to CZK 2500.
According to earlier information, a person who's not going anywhere could have been fined by the city hall.
He was supposed to pay 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum thousand-year fine.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, there is no danger of a ten thousand fine.
According to him, the driver’s license is evidence that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not an I.D. that every person has to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
Just take it or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal authority.
At the end of the year, the cards issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with papers from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
Cards issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are roughly 2.6 million other documents.
The court has reduced the charges to detectives associated with Berdych.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are charged with a criminal conspiracy with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
It was finally decided by the Prague Supreme Court, which so reduced their sentences, one by a year and the other by two years.
Originally, the detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime threatened 14 and 12 years.
There is no appeal against today's decision, it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also being charged in this case, but he is waiting for a first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already been punished for more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court recognised 19 people guilty of involvement in robbery, and today the Supreme Court dealt with 16 appeals.
Most of the defendants have rejected the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police officers in agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed information on to criminals from police sources, covered up individual muggings and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Koňarík.
In the prosecution, it's a gang crime from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery, whose victims have often suffered serious injury to their health, but also abuse of the authority of a public official and illegal armaments.
During home searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, laser sighting or machine gun.
The gang was charged with robbing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already officially recognized the charges of other robberies by Berdych and many others.
Other men in the Berdych area are still confessing in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to trial.
The main trial has thus far been avoided by Tomáš Půt and Maroš Shulej, who are staying in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child change account: 12 million
For replacing the children in the maternity ward, the lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleba wants compensation for CZK 12 million after the Trebeč hospital, plus court expenses.
For each of the mothers of three million, for the fathers of two million, and for the children of a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ondrej Dostál, the hospital’s attorney, therefore, strongly disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," said Dostál after today's meeting.
"However, in order to have an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the opposing party had drawn up.
Let's see if it has any telling value at all.
However, we remain in the opinion that it will be in statistics for all," Dostál emphasized.
According to him, the amount should range between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family wanted a million crowns for every month, when she did not raise her biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for the negotiation of the compensation expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motole.
The parents of children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress at various levels and depths.
Men were better at putting up with stress, even when they were struggling with regrets that they had not prevented the confusion of the newborns.
In turn, women are having a hard time coping with the up-to-date trauma and with what is happening right now, summarizing the content of Velebo.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the Třebíč maternity ward last December 9th.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáků do Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová do Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Hejtman Vysočiny Miloš Vystruk handed over each of the families CZK 100,000 to compensate for the expenses incurred by them by the mistake of the Tříbič hospital, which the region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In the event of errors, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far granted people relatively low compensation, the sums have been calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup lost the Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Soup lost the feud over the brand of the Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, for the first time he used the name Wallachian King, but the project was built by a long-term team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
Soup didn't take part in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client appeals.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolek Soup," said the lawyer after the Soup trial.
According to him, everyone remembers actors and comedians in the words of the Wallachian Kingdom.
Harabish feels the same way.
"We have almost ten years' work behind us.
Collecting money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could get something out of it.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative Business
According to the court, the Wallachian King first used the name Soup on his TV show.
It was crowned in 1993 by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionist event turned out to be a business and lucrative business activity, which Harabiš then established the Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997 Soup agreed to mention its name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting their farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš had only used the bare idea that Soup had published in the ring for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslava The soups of the Wallachian Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that Harabish and his team were the soul of the project, who were intensively involved with him.
The cooperation of today’s broken parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Soup in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have begun to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the establishment of "King Boleslav I, elected permanently".
Jarmila Šuláková, the queen of the mother, took the lead in the kingdom.
In 2002, Soup filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which was dismissed by the court today.
Clearly, Harabish could bring about the upcoming victory for the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal the details and the deadline yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be like riding kings on Slováck.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can apply," said Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearing prejudices
Truth be told, I've never been much of a fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of gearing, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But there's now a successor to Peugeot 207 on the market, and it's much better.
And a wagon called SW goes a little further, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about, for example, the head space in the backseat.
That's the end of the complaint here, because the bodywork of the estate means that even two-metre tall people will not suffer in this direction.
♪ Flying the world ♪
I'll move the interior very quickly so I don't repeat too much.
This is a pretty good design, where the only complaint I have about a poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design invention here, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side line also improved significantly against model 206.
What you can feel in the space and here is an increase in body dimensions.
In the estate, the already mentioned lack of space above the head disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
So the main thing about this car is his baggage man.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (even thanks to a tilting rear window) and as reasonably stored.
The deaf spots are equipped with rubber restraints, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't get in the way, it spreads out, and it keeps the heavier objects.
But let's take a moment together over the volume.
This is according to the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is against the competition rather average value.
Not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to a new generation of Mladá Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot lags behind by a much noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a pram, this value is critical.
But if I were to raise the positives, I still have to mention the flat floor after folding the second row backrests or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre positive four-cylinder with 88 kW power.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old girl should look like who drives a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low-consumption and, above all, it's dragging.
If I compare it to a damage control equivalent that sometimes acts like she's got a stuffed rag in her exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
Price list hints
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a positive 14th light for 329 900 CZK is still good.
Our aggregate costs CZK 410,900, which is quite a lot.
Premium tested equipment will then throw in the equipment for another 80,000 CZK.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper triggers, electric rear window control...
It's just a car costing everything 531,900.
It's a lot, but you can count the extra equipment at Fabie's and you'll get a lot like that.
So all we have to do is make a mark.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
In the UK schools, children from Eastern European countries are growing, which raises concerns for local residents about the further development of local education.
The integration of the East Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children are becoming violent.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates well the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguing, bullying, and fighting among the pupils were also transferred into parent relationships.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The guilty resists being insulted by the boy by racist swearing.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to a bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he turned apples and pears on us, and then he revealed his ass," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even called disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrant countries is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain, headed here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba The Most Beautiful Island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can come true if you choose the right way.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, quiet as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters, offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you'll find it in a full and even richer list.
There is only one island but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba used to be a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus described her as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure hub that Spanish people robbed and transported to Europe in America.
And then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel grew up at the very end of the 1920s.
It was built by one of the US mafia leaders Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially during prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were me.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High - altitude houses grew in Havana, cars that were part of the iconic symbols of the 1950 ’ s were running on wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and he had a yacht in Cojamar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, both show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, they make you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those cult cars from the '50s still drive around Havana, because once imported turtles and fiats in that salty, wet air have rotted long ago.
Even though Havana, especially the oldest part of Havana, is very dilapidated, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places also transform into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much needed money, its development is green.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of Holguin province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pleasure, which is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by trains.
A third of the large plantations were transported to sugar factories along narrow tracks by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been restored for decades, so there are working machines, whose peers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
Most of Cuba's visitors will not miss the most famous places.
And so about Varadero, or about Havana, there's not much to say about.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in Hemingway's already mentioned homestead and anyone who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Vinales Valley One of Cuba's most picturesque corners is the Vinales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone subsoil.
Mogotes, limestone homoles and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and their cavities contain fertile soil, which also makes the weathered rocks covered with dense growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see its final form if you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
Maybe some people find it interesting that there was a Chilean episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and sugar brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has been transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and Escambray, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road that connects that region with the rest of the country.
She's helped him stay away from the isolation.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was broken, everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places nearby, such as Playa Ancon beach or the valley of Cukrovař.
In the evening you can go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark, and the music in it is quiet over the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the very east of Cuba some call it the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion certainly affects the journey itself.
Both roads that run there from Guantánamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that human activity has hardly affected.
Thanks to its intact nature, Cuba's Eastern Expedition has included UNESCO on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, they have Columbus Cross in the church (in fact originated about a hundred years after Columbus cruise) and from the hill where the former castle and the present El Castillo hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestro Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, African religions that profess the descendants of former slaves, there could be many pages about all of this.
But, as they say, it's better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, say Americans
Few soldiers and lack of equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not carried out as planned, representatives of countries in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to increasing opposition from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are today discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates this week, has called NATO troops for more activity, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and strengthening development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next one is to allow residents to start further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC station.
Ninety percent
According to U.S. military figures, Afghan insurgent activity has been the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent events increased by 27 percent compared to last year, even 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have roughly 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which roughly a quarter in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific targets for future times and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that is not enough," Reuters De Hoop said to the agency at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who Is Passive
There have also been disputes among the participating countries in recent months as to whether all the allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the battle demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan slackers revealed: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went into counterattack and printed a photo of the British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the state debt amounts to over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to improved development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842,7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
However, it has decreased by CZK 13.4 billion since June.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed today its figures on the government debt from early October.
For every Czech, the debt is over 84,000 crowns.
In the whole last year, the state owed more than CZK 111 billion.
"For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year we could not overcome the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should be between CZK 900 billion and a trillion," David Marek told iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance.
Similarly, next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it: "We could get to exceed one trillion in 2009.
When exactly will depend on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could shift to 2010.
But I do not expect this change," he said.
Debts are growing
Government debt constitutes central government debt and is created primarily by accumulation of state budget deficits.
State debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has so far increased by 38,5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion this year.
Foreign debt has so far increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion this year.
The so-called tradable government debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the sovereign debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose 13 percent year on year for the first to third quarter, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that it will be what to trade with when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented.
Better than expected.
The strategy of financing and managing government debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to improved development of the state budget.
The amount consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is the planned maximum resources for the Czech consolidation agency CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion pension reserve, the financing of government bonds worth CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
On Thursday evening, a British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum Tribunal and expelled, as stated by her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils name the teddy bear Mohamed despite the fact that any depiction of the Prophet Islam is forbidden.
She was subjected to a whiplash.
This British 45-year-old teacher, working at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven - year - old students to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
"Eight names will be heard from the children, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed", says Robert Boulos, headmaster.
After the class vote, 20 out of 23 children will eventually choose Muhammad as the most popular name.
Of course Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but it is, above all, a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a teddy bear accompanied by a label: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no label with that name on it, but the trouble is in the very depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons, a fellow Muslim who teaches at the same school in Sudan, made it clear that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said, "innocent misconduct".
This opinion is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "never talk about religion in class".
Let us recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most commonly given first name in the UK, and in English it is written in 14 different ways.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way to honor the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of that first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended their sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement," said European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to keep their commitments to peace and to be prepared for dialogue even after the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, "it is evident that the situation is tense".
Negotiations end on 10 December
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go to Kosovo on Monday for the last time.
The future of the province, where 90 percent are Albanian-speaking populations, could appear in a clearer light as of December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, commissioned the Troika to renegotiate negotiations.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on December 10.
On the other hand, Russians who previously blocked Kosovo’s independence from the UN Security Council insist that negotiations continue beyond this final deadline.
"Russia was and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Charchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community administration, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina claims that if the Security Council does not decide on its behalf, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on widespread autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," said Fatmir Sejdi, President of Kosovo's self-government, at the Baden hotel, where this "last chance deal" has been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise is still an option and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
'However, it does not mean that for Serbia', he said, 'the compromise is impossible'.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"The Kosov Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution arising from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu replied to the journalists that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status" and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking people, it would take place "in agreement" with the West.
Bush has won an agreement on Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called out of his impulse, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate opening of negotiations with the intention of resolving a 60-year dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, declared Bush, and recalled the obligations that flow for both sides from the "road map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim to 'conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues without exception, including central issues'.
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled in the 1948 conflict from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took up the words of the President of the United States and emphasized that the subsequent negotiations should be "total and thorough" and to touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, safety, among other things".
Then Olmert, who expressed his position that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "proposed to be concluded during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the date for the realization of his "vision of two states", a Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has taken a commitment from Bush to this effect even before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries offering peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saudi in an interview that he provided to an Arabic-speaking daily covered by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (IGPN), a police car passed through the Louis-Michel street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday after 17:00.
"The vehicle was not in the mode of intervention, but was on patrol and passed at 40 to 50 km/h, without side lights on", explains the police source.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore without permission to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without helmet, passed through "very high speed".
"The motorcycle crashed into a police car from the left, after not giving priority to the right," said one police officer.
The blood alcohol test performed on the crew of the vehicle turned negative.
The condition of the car (the punctured front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) is indicative of the sharpness of the impact.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérès de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had commissioned the investigation into the "involuntary killing and failure to provide assistance to persons at risk", which is also being taken over by the department départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Director of the Regional Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by IGPN excluded, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
According to the clerk, three witnesses of the accident who were questioned on Sunday evening confirmed "the version of police officers, namely, that the minimotor came to them quite quickly from the left".
A striation, no doubt caused by rubbing the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the moment the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and passed through technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on both victims' bodies yesterday.
What happened, right after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, there was quick talk that police officers should have left the scene quickly without giving two youngsters first aid.
IGPN should, in all due care, also rule out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"It is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more research and with which to be very careful", said the police source.
The Libération diary met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident occurred.
"Immediately, my cousin and I, who are a nurse in the hospital, ran downstairs to try to resurrect them," the Witness relates.
There was nothing we could do".
Then he saw "a limping, completely terrified cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with rapidly increasing tension and certainty that the situation of the youngsters was hopeless, police officers were taken by the car of colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They also did a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush the youngsters to help.
These youngsters were first aided.
Fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor emphasized.
Tensions in Pakistan Increase
On Monday, the Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstration since the announcement of a state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, some 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against emergency measures were injured by tear gas grenades, which, according to witnesses, were used by law enforcement forces.
The last names answered with stones, which injured several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been subpoenaed.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, attorneys of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked by roadblocks on Monday morning in order to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers gained the support of religious parties grouped together in the politically strong alliance Muttahid Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "instigated the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the exceptional state, and garbage to those who swore an oath before Musharraf".
"Musharraf's promise is not valid"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the next few days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election that took place on 6 October.
President of the court Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"All that we are witnessing is unlawful, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court's judgments," said an official in The News.
Parvíz Musharraf's promise to give up the leadership of the army and become civilian president,"doesn't apply" after the introduction of a state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15th, when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Otherwise, the Pakistani government has also refuted in a country of ongoing speculation, according to which the deputy military chief was to order President Musharraf to be grounded.
More than a third of the pregnancy still constitutes an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected ones.
More than one pregnancy of three (36 %) is still unexpected today, it reveals a study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected ones.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, estimates Ined.
After all, the regulation of contraception has enabled better "fertility control", claims the Institute and notes that the rate of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age has reached 60% today from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight out of ten births are well planned today.
One out of five couples even have labor calculated for the month accurately and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant season for the birth of the child.
A Remarkable Repair of Space Station
For more than seven hours of space work, astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed a remarkable repair of the ruptured solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky climb into space that collected records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned and the levels of "skill" that astronauts spent on repair.
Trouble appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing dock for modules-laboratory.
These, however, need to be supplied by electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17-and-a-half-tonne power-generating module using solar panels already located on the ISS to anchor at its final station.
After it was moved, the crew began to dismantle the 60-foot solar panels of the module.
And in that one of the panels, decomposing like a pulling harmonica, as a result of the snap of the cable, was damaged on an area of nearly one meter.
Decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control output to the Discovery ship, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go flying to the end of the robot arm of the ship, added to the station's arm, and did the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers in the U.S. Air and Space Bureau.
Tall, strong, very skillful, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" the "corrupted" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed some sort of "snaps" on the damaged sites.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" who remained close to the equalization chamber, and also from within, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, commander of the crew.
The tools he used, namely a mini-hockey with an insulation device to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and "after the DIY" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely dismantled and then inventoryd his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day's rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
EADS is losing sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after this airline and defence industry company has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
EADS has lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to reconsider its projected production results for 2007 due to delays resulting from slow progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the initial flight.
The cost of alleviating delays in the delivery of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was calculated "to EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European EADS designer.
Due to these costs, the EADS, next Thursday, will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before interest and tax deduction (EBIT) when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponded to a six-month delay.
Let us recall that the EADS production results fell by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army would be provided in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday’s elections will take place without any suspense: the Russians will elect President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming this, after the end of the very little free election campaign, its drive to stability, even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the House of Commons, Russian President Vladimir Putin will give the voters a pre-recorded television message at public stations, but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as leader of the United Russia, the Prokremel Party, which apparently celebrates a overwhelming victory.
When he received ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president let nothing out of him and settled for another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish for honest, transparent and open elections, elections without the slightest blemish on beauty", he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
The Communist leader Gennadij Zjuganov says that "never had such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, according to her lawyer, continues to have no visitors.
"The Russians remain the mentality of homo sovietica"
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple tense expectations, two far more open questions are being profiled:
- "Who will become Putin's successor to the presidency?
Yesterday, the official paper published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
But there is no follower.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of United Russia, who chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the whole line in parliamentary elections as well as in the presidential elections.
It's tradition.
"The Russians remain the mentality of homo sovietica, they do not feel masters of their destiny", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, notes the more distant contexts: civil society has gained, in this country, christened five centuries after Europe, a delay; the famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed the paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so that this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by some economic well-being", argues Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are now "voluntarily giving up personal responsibility", which they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"What's to think about?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) run local candidates in the United Russia.
The new freedoms taken over from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Čerednchenko, a 45-year-old professor: "What to think about?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Memory Loaded
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, are opening up to the public.
The 47 million archive documents stored 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have been accessible until this time only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
Eleven states responsible for managing archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the ratification process for this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to explore "especially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or warrants drawn up by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labour subjected to civilians, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are still dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin's Technische Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve free trade agreements in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India has reached almost EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Treaty in 2008, and the European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath have announced.
In April last year, the EU Foreign Ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now almost €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The free trade agreement has hugely drugged both economies" and "India will gain better access to the 450 million prosperous Europeans market", said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specified by the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants will exchange "EUR 47 billion in goods" and "EUR 10 billion in services" each year, said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its full potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The English bank took note of its concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank of England indicated its intention to alleviate the current concerns that credit market conditions would deteriorate again and to announce a bid of £10 billion in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75 %, a bid of an unusually long duration.
"In order to ease the concern that the financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater confidence in the way they secure their cash position for this period, Banka intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", it announced in the communication.
The Bank states that £10 billion (€14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January at the base interest rate.
It seems that this is the first time that BOE has been pumping cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They normally last a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "it remains ready to take further measures to maintain interest rates on a daily basis" of interbank loans at the same level as its basic rate.
The inter-bank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, which is the highest figure since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, sums have been placed on the financial market by the Bank of England linked to the rates of charges that discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many prefer to opt for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for the People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to deal with the Socialists' (PS) proposals on purchasing capacity
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss the various paragraphs of the Socialist Bill on Purchasing, which equals the rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law came within the so-called Socialist Nest (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the Presidency of the PS, which included an increase in the employment premium of 50%, a renewal of varying TIPPs, a transport cheque or rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against the various paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television performance on purchasing power.
The PS Chief Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act to be discussed by the House next week.
A New Festival Is Coming
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the British organizer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, without exaggeration, inspired the current festival movement in America," revealed Charlie Jones from C3 on Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival should take place from 8th to 10th August on a private farm with an area of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licenses and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he's ever experienced and says that his firm and Melvin Benna are simultaneously working to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to start a festival in the heart of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We dealt with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, due to the current city leadership, we have become entangled in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Unfortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss Melvin Benn and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after they excelled on the festival scene in 2002 by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to 9.8M$ and 11.3M$.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benna festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in green areas in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the impression of a rural festival after a European and a city after an American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but they say "that they are advantageous enough to allow investment in such an event and welcome the festival that will hopefully have a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent out to groups, but nothing can be confirmed yet when the program is released to the press.
"Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be varied to attract as much as possible a wide range of viewers", says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners who received the Top Independent Promoter award in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when Terminator himself opposes...
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall into "Governor"'s claws?
"It is necessary to be careful, it is the industry who decides where it will go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favourable, he'll go there.
Our task is to offer the ones they will consider best," he said.
Hunting for festivals
For the moment, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is to promote a local film.
The Oscar hunt has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether they are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting Québec's films, drawing attention to them and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
A few weeks ago, the age of darkness had good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January it will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also introduced four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experts split the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year and investors already have my hands in anticipation of the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December has a positive stock exchange trend".
However, it is not appropriate to produce forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context, markets offer certain doubts, at least in the short term".
These experts do not expect the stock exchange to move in recent weeks of the year and state that "the stock market maintains the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest in view of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income affected by the effect of turnover on quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, 'particularly because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates (Federal Reserve System) is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of stimulus to inflation pressures'.
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of the BPI bank in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to make bold statements that there will be a marathon.
"There are not many reasons to rejoice," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed to 15,944,7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst for Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio regrouping and traditional supplementary pension deposits that occur every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, because he believes that the marathon will take place sooner, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitutional Day.
The above analyst does not consider that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels, and "that is why we could observe the reflection of the index caused by US reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree in the selection of titles that will ensure that Ibex delivers to the new maximum points.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "the year is up to the strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, 'because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive'.
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been regaining positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path", explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology will also do very well, although they are not very well represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of downfall in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We will see again whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year (Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Bank of Popular has decided to modernise most of its branches.
Two hundred in total, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
As well as for other Spanish entities, it is the first group that has decided to make such a leap and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, which also assured several times that it wanted to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to enter into an agreement with trade unions to cancel 75% of its branches’ opening hours on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular will be crucial for other players to join this initiative, which supports opening hours of business, or not.
This is precisely the aim of the project that Popular Bank has set out.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The Bank intends to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new branches, but only the adjustment of existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernise the branches it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the client profile on individual streets.
The extension of the opening hours is supplemented by a different concept of branch space and new, more recent design in lighter colours.
The business director of Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will mean not a large investment, but more recruitment, as it is switching from six employees to a branch of eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branch offices were selected in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
The Bank of Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialised immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when many of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', says Rivera.
They've just agreed with Telefónica to sell cell phones through external personnel.
Telecinco doubled the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time on the stock market
We did it.
With that sentence, yesterday Paolo Vasile, Executive Chairman Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trade when he stated that the TV he was running had doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I regret is that it did not happen because we grew more, but because we fell less', he said.
Yet he emphasized that thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday by a shift of 2.54%.
This profit shifted their loss to 15.66% for the past part of the year.
According to Bloomberg, the exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with Vocent’s participation (another 13%) is EUR 4,488.88 million.
Its competitor, Antena 3, who fell by 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5% since January overall, has a half value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated amounts to 3.571 billion in Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (issuer of Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we will evaluate it in the ratings'.
Telecinco announced last week that this year, by overcoming billions of gross advertising revenue, it will become the first television channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising branch.
If the forecast had actually been achieved, this TV channel would have seen an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year compared to 960.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (which amounted to 734.4 million), while the net revenues of this TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on, for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock market, is the increased payout that it has maintained: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevaría, split 100 % of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always reported much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates by 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the assumed growth in income has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast profit of Antena 3, namely 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Ibersecurity: recommends buying both titles mainly on the basis of increased dividend yield and sustainable potential in the long term.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco (assemble) better than Anten 3 (maintain) because of its 'number of advantages' and trade growth.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases recommends not to overestimate them, as they face 'similar threats' (oversaturated market and degraded economic environment).
Congress approved MiFID transposition valid from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today by the vote of Congress on amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government subjected the new law to a public hearing with a view to both of them entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the parties have consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the different supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial consultancy services to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities brokering offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of operations with financial instruments is expanding by connecting multilateral trading and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stockbrokers.
Furthermore, the Act obliges investment service providers to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of dealing with risk, and requires a statement of all operations performed to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the hearing in the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which were outstanding, for securitised claims to be considered a "complicated" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the US with high risk mortgage debt (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that bachelors in the field of economics and corporate governance can hold for 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as a broker who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data at a time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimating information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is merely indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data available on 14 December of this year.
"The ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level"
The second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Affairs Pedro Solbes said that the November ISC increase to 4.1% is a 'temporary number', but at the same time predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively high in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes made it clear in the corridors of Congress that "even if it is not a positive number", Spain's inflation differential towards monetary union has been still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%", said the Minister for Economic Affairs on the data submitted today.
Virgin plans to make 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (16.8 billion).
At that time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually declined in the two and a half months of client mistrust, even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which replaces the name of the entity with its trademark Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of the revenue deposited into British banks over the next three years to get the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
The tycoon Richard Branson group, known in the United Kingdom for its striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to reach its resolution.
This week, Northern Rock marked the offer of the Virginia Consortium, which makes up three other companies, as one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices during construction
In the early hours of the morning, the Civilian Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian town of Totana (the People's Party) due to his alleged involvement in the corruption practices during construction that were discovered this week.
Furthermore, one of the city hall’s secretaries and the chief of local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales in May of this year, a contemporary member of the People's Party and until then, the mayor of the municipality, who according to the investigative sources addressed by Caden Ser, could have been the head of the entire company.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the City Hall and the Construction Commission, and further arrests are not excluded in the next hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the prime suspect in the corruption practices of construction, was accused of being discovered earlier this week.
As Caden SER, the lawyer of 'human' Member Juan Morales, who was vetted yesterday, was arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to the sources of investigation, Morales' alleged collection of commissions for his signature of the construction agreement with the Galician construction company, which was overqualified for 200 hectares of land, is under investigation.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, preside over Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary-General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general elections, and, if the Socialists win the general elections, he will be Chairman of Congress.
This was announced at the press conference by the PSOE Secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place at the federal headquarters of the party at noon today.
The chief of executives justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He also noted that 'yes, it seems' that this politician from La Mancha will be a candidate for the Socialist Party for the President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
As Chairman of Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who published on 15 November his decision not to run in the next general elections and to abandon his active political career in order to engage in the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly urged him to return to the top politics he had left two years ago.
He further stated that, just as citizens know who will be Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, if PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent way" who will chair Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not a swearing or screaming" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Unfortunately, sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where peace and quiet cannot be spoken is Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate, on one occasion, has been interrupted 26 times".
Likewise, he spoke praiseworthy words to the current President Manuel Marín and 'his good work', and so far he did not want to imagine himself in his place, so that he would not reduce himself to what his opponents might consider 'greatness'.
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change has subjected ruthless persecution to both those who view its predictions sceptically and those who prefer other political and social struggles, it has to show firm cohesion.
Moreover, to have a movement leader who is Prime Minister as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's actions or inaction contributed significantly to Spain's failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening and why its government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take in order to slow climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, which energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But we didn't get any of those explanations, and we won't get them.
It's because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centime of the price of petrol, proposed by PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky for Zapatero in terms of elections that he rushed to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And with contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that do not speak, blame, demand nothing, but adorn meetings and stir up tenderness.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractor and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totana arrested on suspicion of corruption practices during construction
As the sources of inquiry have been informed, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, the "people" of José Martínez Andrea, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in hospitality, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located along with a number of police officers, who also came to the Construction Commission and the City Enterprise for Industrial Property and Housing Management.
These three arrests were added to six, which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving the retraining of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are charged in an abbreviated trial in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
Six of the first arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency, registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the Autonomous Region, was charged.
Manuel N.A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo, was arrested in Nigran ( Pontevedra Province), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which bribes were handed over.
The investigation is carried out by a crime group under construction by the Civilian Guard Operations Central Unit, whose members, in addition to arrest, also carried out eleven searches, mostly in firms related to the arrests, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (the province of Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, in the area of the well - known owner of the company for poultrymeat products, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the construction of the largest residential complex in the town of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "sleeping".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the settlement of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
It happens, too.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's issue of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18th, on the same day that the critics of Blackburn's book coincided:
"The content of the subject philosophy has penetrated public debates in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his notes.
Pekka Elo, the school councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded that professors take a critical view of Plato and claimed that there was no need to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory primary course of philosophy at secondary schools."

One colleague informs on the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the penal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime at a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you dispose of plates in the store for less than EUR 400, it is considered a mere offence (§ 623.1).
B. estranged in a store of up to EUR 1,000, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than for withdrawal (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It's less serious to be in a fight than a compact shift.
Participation in disorderly conduct has a rate from three months to one year (Art. 154 of the Criminal Code) and would have a rate from six months to two years for the exchange of compacts
(Art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is more punished than the provision of pornographic materials to minors (§ 186).
So if my colleague's right, someone's arm got away, hard.

My attending physician is giving me one of his articles on strange research called "Money Causes Brain Activation, Especially If Others Get Less."
Or, the feelings that a month’s salary generates for employees depend on what colleagues earn.
Research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomography and results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the group leader Displaying the Neurocognition of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the research participant reacted correctly and his colleague wrongly."
Researchers observed that if both of them succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one was double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
Applicant for the Balkans
For eight years now, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly harassing criminals from the Balkan War in the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Its mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladič and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzič, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which they took over the title of the documentary film by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not listed in Spain), which at the pace of the detective thriller, from Belgrade to New York, the work of the Swiss prosecutor, in pursuit of the escaped criminals and the pressure on the respective states to pull the net.
What kind of insurance is appropriate for me?
The insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a significant expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, duration of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking receives an agreed premium amount of a certain amount for taking care of the damage in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined by reference to various factors such as age, condition, gender, duration of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle which is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the probability of a crash, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons over the age of 25 and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that married persons have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of journeys and thus the probability of having an accident.
The growth in the frequency of rides increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when they determine the price of insurance premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance which best fits his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for the selection of one or the same type of insurance, which, in addition to complying with the type of insured person, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 face various disadvantages such as the lack of driving experience and the short possession of a driving licence when they want to book insurance premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good cover, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with an insurance discount in such a way as to obtain insurance cover for all risks but at a more acceptable price.
This type of contract would assume the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"Part of the payment of the insurance event provided by the client will be determined in advance in determining the price of the premium, which will be even higher, how much less there would be a contribution", explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants by insureing the client against damage caused by other persons, but not against damage on his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction of the basic rate that an insurance company has.
On the other hand, malus is an increase in the basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to raise the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the 25-year limit, drivers have it easier when they go to get insurance, because the client risk index is decreasing, thanks to acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident and even during the procedure", assures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most accidents occur in the second year of the procedure, when the "fear of the newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation permits.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies as clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could be EUR 300) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," said Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended to cover all risks with a premium discount (of EUR 150) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a strong reason for appropriate examination of the insurance options that would suit us most in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get at the AC Milan point, which means the eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to gain a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, since for the Italians it would mean being the first and for the Scots it would decide the location.
The Italians have ten points, and they have already secured progress in the fifth game by a tie in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure that he doesn't get in front of him a Chechťor with six points to play with Benfika, who has four.
These two D-group matches will be played a week before the sixth round is finished, because AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where he will start on the 13th in the semifinals, in an attempt to advance to the finals, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive outcome at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to compete for victory, because the Italians will not want to tactize on home soil and Celtic knows that after the win he would be the first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose if Chechťor doesn't win, but he can't count on it, because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1), but won the first straight game (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening for the Scots who believe that they will make the second semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same game in the last competition with the Kaka goal in overtime (1:0) after the state 0:0 in the base playing time.
Hoping to win the "rossoneri" will be the Chechťor, for whom it is worth winning, only if Celtic loses, both for progress into the eight-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although last and unable to continue in the highest European competition, could win a third place, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
Spice Girls started its first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20,000 spectators since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their gig at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver said that the reconnection of their group was "great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to be present for the concert, which also included a video that depicts the history of this group, which triggered a sensation in the late 1990 ’ s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as a new album released by the EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets, which were donated by their husband "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, despite Victoria’s nervous ban on it a few days ago.
Before the start of the performance Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the contradictions between us" caused the disbanding of a five-member group two years later, also showed its nervousness in meeting journalists two hours before the start of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, that the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made my decision," Chisholm said about reconnecting the group that she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things have settled and we all love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since the last time the Spice Girls performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver with a special Virgin Airlines.
An army of nannies was expecting them at the airport when they arrived.
Five have seven children in total.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on 23 December.
Concerns about the new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
The dispute over gas prices is currently under way between Russia and Ukraine, so the risk of Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe is increasing.
Most of Russia's fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is pipelined across Ukraine, and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raised gas prices to Ukraine, Russia would charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more because he has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas he receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoli Kinach to Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees (to Western Europe) via Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in deliveries from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has caused an overwhelming fall in exports to Western Europe, which has sharply increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of them remain under-utilised.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The supervisor said that the Scottish NHS Chamber must improve the control of criminal records of non-European employees.
A recommendation from the president of Robert Black's Supreme Audit Office came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the number of foreign personnel he employs.
But his report pointed out that the other key checks were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The president of the Supreme Audit Office was immediately interested in personnel from countries outside the European Economic Area following the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
22-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of being connected to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
A report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other things, that the Commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which help employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we have discovered that part of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report announced.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS is much in line with its own policy of pre-employee checks, but he also added: "Our report draws attention to areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the number of foreign personnel."
President of BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employee controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employee controls in the Scottish NHS work well and it is not clear what further value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1 161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably be higher, too, because the Commission had difficulty identifying personnel with residence permits.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revamping the policies and directives of pre-employee controls for NHS foreign workers.
Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to handle this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best practices appear in the updated directives of the pre-employee controls of all personnel - including the foreign one - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division took over the movie awards
Control, a biographical film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for the best film.
The awards were also won by star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis played, director Anton Corbijn and Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress behind the thriller of the scandal.
And the Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The prizes were handed over in London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' path to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost only £3 million.
But he got the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic U2 album cover Joshua Tree, two prizes - for the best director and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning one - because Julien Temple's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen was awarded the best actor’s plaque as a driver of the Russian mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard men, won the Richard Harris Award for an extraordinary contribution to British film.
This 50 - year - old, whose films include, for example, Scum, Nil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones — the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He is my man, a great actor of his time, I am very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury where filmmakers, actors and festival organizers sit.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people because of a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities, as well as on spiritual and security forces.
State television told the largest oil exporter that one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since 2003, since the invasion of Iraq.
The TV report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid response unit of 35 000 members to defend the facilities from the failed Al Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrested were one of the cells led by the "missile launcher" that slipped into the country.
She further stated that the militants were planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try harder to prevent the Saudis from leaving for Iraq to join the Al-Qaeda militants fighting allied forces and the Shia government supported by the US, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities co-opted many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants - supported by the calls of al-Qaeda leader Saudia Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," said the state television internal spokesperson for the Ministry.
Also arrested was the 16-member "media cell" in Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims designated as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate of Venus can be seen in the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
The data from the orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more like the headstrong twin Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the effluent greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and lower rate of rotation sent Venus along a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and be ravaged by storms and hurricane winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency’s probe Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a modest view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics of Oxford University and one of the Heads of Mission Venus Express said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, although the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to build a scenario in which Venus began, like Earth, perhaps even with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police have intercepted "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
Police spokesperson said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
♪ Still wide open ♪
Mitt Romney said that it is not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over to candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions broadcast on Wednesday, November 28, were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other side’s YouTube debate.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected much about the state of the Republican Party toward the elections next year.
It is not clear exactly how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the most powerful Republican themes.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the disc when they heard something pleasing: the announcer recorded the peaks of consent when candidates talked about hard access at the border.
The hardest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who has poked his way forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his house.
These two were particularly struggling when the interviewers asked if one of the candidates would support "amnesty" (give illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Other candidates, like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of these two have a chance of a nomination, but both remain in the game, perhaps because they started to sound the alarm for immigration sooner and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have about the same opinion: greater rigour at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the conflict between the liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate got very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani has been asked why he has supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through it to the point that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now at the top of all the assumptions in the recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to stand for a laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr Huckabee's growth in Iowa coincides with recent achievements in raising money and the loud cheers of Ron Paul in the debate on Wednesday.
These two have bounced back from the bottom, because the two wings of the party still cannot agree on more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning news of American greatness on his lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
There doesn't seem to be any orders sold, no accounts at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would do without discovering that a wealthy businessman for four years has masked the contributions to the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under other people's names and that the party has not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by surveys, there was a hope that he would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being worded by an increasingly witty representative of the Liberal Democrats, the once feared Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of the troubled bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in driving and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative failure.
The three retired generals launched a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are multiple gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of Labour (and their former internal discipline guard) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is irrevocably heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the tipping point behind which they find heavy governance.
People don't trust politicians and they don't like politicians, but they usually push their mistrust away when a new crew takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister probably won't improve anything, and he doesn't have to be in office for long, this is a push away: the government becomes a leak, the ministers start making briefings, the press looks for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because he cannot assume the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the tax office's records are linked to the decisions made by Mr Brown as Secretary of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair's troubles, such as a long investigation into the funding of political parties caused by 'values for money', voters can easily conclude that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's difficulties are not as bad as they seem.
Those missteps aren't as terrible as conservatives make them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been completely deceived.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The latest commotion about political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charity, says he wanted no publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't his.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who might buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' progress but did not know it was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly questioned; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money collector who learned of tricky donations in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these machinations, even though the main part of the payments took place after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He quickly condemned this violation by his own party, but he diluted his determination by reaching out for a proven instrument, a commission for examining this matter - also led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, this is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and moving on with a real reform of political party funding.
This would require Labour, who are in dire straits, to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives are now well ahead of the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to win is to be unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the US credit card market affect the subprime mortgage crisis?
When there's blood in the water, naturally the dorsal fins begin to wave aroused.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is wasting away, predators have targeted the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that losing on credit cards could reach $99 billion if subprime mortgages infected other consumer credit options.
The signs of tension are clear.
There is an increase in the number of cases of inability to repay (at more than 30 days late payment) and written-off accounts (accounts considered by the provider to be unenforceable).
HSBC announced last month that it lost $1.4 billion on the US consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it is still too early to panic.
There is still little written-off accounts and inability to repay.
According to Moody's evaluation agency, 3.89% of the insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below the average.
The worsening rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US law on personal bankruptcy in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which make a large part of the credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore rise, regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers worsened.
The sector also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts per month.
And trust in credit card securities is solid, despite paralysis in other parts of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup's research firm predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% larger than last year.
Direct ways to spread infections between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when real-estate loans dry up, consumers tend to owe themselves over credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, look at cash flow rather than the value of guarantee items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They may even be advantageous for loan providers.
Consumer incentive to repay mortgages falls when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; consequently, credit on cards is shifted up to the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the price of guarantee items.
"It doesn't happen that one beautiful morning we'll just re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Chief Financial Officer of Capital One.
Even if the risk of a subprime mortgage explosion is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers have pleaded guilty to the Enron case.
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraud associated with the former financial leader of Enron Andrew Fastow changed their testimony on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of seven fraud charges, where they were supposed to participate in financial fraud together with Fastow in 2000 -- enriching themselves at the expense of their employers -- denied.
They were due to stand trial in January.
However, during the trial before US District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest executives, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front page for two years, which lasted the extradition process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unsealed parts of an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's collapse.
The prosecution against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to con a scam along with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner branch controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of many Enron frauds that pushed Enron in a spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank evaluated its share in this branch by zero, but our three British people knew it was actually worth a lot.
The company under Kopper's control bought a share of the bank in this $1 million branch.
Incriminated bankers paid the Koppers $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to Fastow, Enron falsely informed that an energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But the 20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the prosecution, the bankers received $7.3 million, and Fastow, Kopper, and others increased by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper's been in prison for three years and one month at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Brits were free on bail for $1 million that ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks made it impossible to hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market value, and more than $2 billion of pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their role in the fall of society.
Skilling is in charge of more than a 24-year sentence.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow’s Non-Powerless
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many jobs, because it's for a narrow family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of spectacular consumption at the mammoth exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury vendors built their stalls, hoping that the newly rich Russians would attract everything from mahogany lined yachts to diamond-decorated car counters that even 50 Cent would not be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer carefully looked for a bright orange Porsche at the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's pennies and dimes against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market in private aircraft."
Oil waves are pouring money into the Russian capital, just like when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans became enormously rich and went to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard.
Just like Saudi spreaders from the '70s and the Japanese in the '90s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Klondika.
In another place in Moscow this week, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford, and Bernard Arnault, the president of the LVMH Group, drew ideas about how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The Conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of the richest people in Forbes magazine, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total worth of $282 billion.
Moreover, the local main institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, whose assets totalling $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London Jewellery David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly groomed and men are worth a fortune each."
As they walked through the halls on Sunday evenings, 21 - year - old Evgenia Yumatova and five years older Svetlana Turovcova called themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who wrapped herself in branded clothing like a red carpet veteran, who makes Joan Rivers look like a homemade chick.
The fair seemed to be focused mainly on fresh rich people, well-managed Russian buyers, who are willing to sit for several hours in the road so that they could walk around the warehouse, which shoutly mix Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, pool tables tailored, apartments in Dubai, Gund stuffed animals and draft.
Members of the common public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr.Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproduction of Rembrandt's painting of hand-painted blue tile of over-life size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gilding."
Indeed, the local vendors say that Russians with old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from flashy logos to few known brands of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, millionaires, millionaires, or simple tourists, flooded the trade fair halls day after day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local bed manager general King Koil, said that he sold two mathrac sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold threads, after $70,000.
Also, on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, who equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, said on request that he had sold three bars to cars in the style of linked chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms after $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car bike designed for a Russian casino owner, which had a Swarovski crystal-coated fabric that looked like a roulette wheel.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconium, doesn't have to ride those wheels yet," said Karapetian.
"He puts them in his garage of 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently means nothing very exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at a stand run by the Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company erected four red phone booths of British style stuffed columns of counterfeit bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaires Fair.
The passers-by stopped to throw a pile of money around, or let their friends take pictures of them with a cell phone resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or just stuffed a pocket with a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the big windows of the local restaurant a little healthier and followed the ambulance that arrived at the white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's van arrive," said Mr Livingston, restaurant supervisor.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that a dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, executive assistant director of the New York Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief to the administration of the Newark police.
Miss Arroy was assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and worked hard," McCarthy said about Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, State's Attorney for Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to find out if Miss Arroy died from an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one of the possibilities," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. 21.
November, and they found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is said to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities questioned Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a broken pink bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the basement, a blue barrel in the open garage, marked "Ethyl Vanilla" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark, after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroy gave him invaluable help in biting through the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this one or this one," he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to a strengthening of the global stock market
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market’s hope that the Federal Bank would try to calm the lending conditions by further lowering interest rates was reinforced by the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
Exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernank, the Fed’s chairman, said that in responding to continued pressure on the financial markets, the leaders must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In an obvious attempt to calm down irritable markets in the midst of signs of rising credit effort, Mr Kohn said that recent excitement 'particularly reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and in October'.
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility that the financial conditions of households and firms will deteriorate further will be increased.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh capital benefits to US markets, and possibly further cuts in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These comments also helped calm down Wall Street in the midst of other bad news about the US economy when the sale of flats in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of financial vortex were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would cancel 650 jobs, which is 4 % of its world workforce, in reducing costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by a failed bet on the provision of low-level housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York City, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index strengthened by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306,2, with the value of the British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets became strong after the European Central Bank's three-month cash packages auction lent these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB to release above-standard money on London’s money markets has increased, with rates of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" rising to a maximum since late September – 6.59 percent, following undisturbed growth from November 12.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who's gonna be number six on the England bat this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in the wider context, no less relevant than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection committee, who holds on to this position at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, with a decision to help and because Hugh Morris's desk, chief manager of the English team, is starting to be filled with applications to be a national collector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
Anyone who doesn't take the sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is far from fair.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, choice is challenging and requires an assessment that must always be subjective in the end.
Is this the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if so?
We could also ask the same question in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the commission - the place is only for one.
Who's to say which level is right for cricketers if he can't sink or swim to the next?
Naturally, numbers have a great influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
On the team, the cricketer must at the right moment capture the captain's view of whether to take the Wicket, and the batter needs regular chances of starting positions, if he should ever make an impression as a day cricketer.
It's more complicated to catch a collector's eye.
For example, last season there were many better ones, which James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 pickets in first class at 33 times each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same modest average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish both careers, or it may not have much influence.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and in first class, he performed well, five Wickets and 40 vacation runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who fought for his place at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, which is extra, although in Australia he scored twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training at Asirgya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's more experience to Bopar's youthful luxuriance.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut test shifts speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class compared to the six Bopars, who are, at 22 years of age, seven years younger and have excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah did only ten runs in two shifts in May against the Caribbean at the Lord's Test, his Middlesex home field, along with the immediate rejection of the collectors, when Vaughan wanted to retake him for the next match, his batting seems to have taken away something from the enthusiasm that was so obvious in Mumbai.
On the other hand, the Essex universal has a joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket field, and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently turned four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of an English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (of course sponsored), and he called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched it from afar to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed skidballs on the local courses that seem to suit him, gives away effectively and swings confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah is not going to excel if, as Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he's going to be the one playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and emptying refugees who ran out of money or had expired their visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight with the armed men who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of dozens of buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubajsi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the paper, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, meaning the Shiite militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop the fight.
Kasim al-Atwani, a thirty-eight-year-old Shia teacher from predominantly Sunni area of Amarija, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaria called him, saying that the local militia, with the support of the American army, helped to push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan’s new arrivals is the leader of the Sunni and Shia tribe, which was expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago a few friends called me and told me that they were starting a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said 26-year-old Sabaah Al Obeidi.
Many spoke of the attractiveness of calming in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and growth of local "groups of biased citizens", which, with a gun at the side of the US military, defend their neighborhood.
But more talked about being forced back by visa obstruction and money loss in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the 51-year-old father of three children, expressed a loud suspicion shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and thus force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," Sunni said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
A partial reason for weakening violence is the fact that the Sunni were pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
Fears are emerging that the sudden influx of refugees will once again stir up sectarian tensions and lead to further struggle.
Little Sársko, good education
Germany’s smallest country plays a leading role in vocational training, excelling even the international focus of its universities.
Only in one educational area is Saarland concerned by the same lack as the rest of Germany.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this self-irorical slogan appears on posters in Saarsk on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country's birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Colleges thus traditionally cooperate closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students may terminate their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15,6 %.
After all, the above-average number of sárských children is admitted to university - many of them even without studying at the gymnasium.
"The educational system is used in Sársko", says Axel Plünnecke, educational expert IW.
By getting more than one in five juniors to study at a vocational school, Sársko is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich possibilities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two disciplines are the second best in Germany, given the number of inhabitants.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Syria has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering.
"After the first study of Pisa, we carried out several reforms in general education schools," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
The government therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model taken over by other federal countries.
If the results of pupils improve significantly, future comparative studies will show up.
In carrying out the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 % to 20 %.
In total, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians can do better than that.
And to the disappointment of the Sársko study, Pisa does not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sársko could be scoring in this area.
The language of the neighbors is compulsory at the high school - even if the inhabitants of Sársko are not French.
Chávez shifts the clock
The hours in Venezuela are about to go differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will have the clock moved back half an hour in this South American country.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that the clock would shift by minus four and a half hours, according to the new law, compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the US, justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the world to divide time zones over hours.
In addition, on Wednesday local time, Chávez announced that he was breaking relations with neighboring Colombia due to the hostage case.
This left-wing nationalist said that as long as Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will maintain no relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"For my self-respect, I can no longer," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution on which the people of this oil country must vote in a Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would greatly strengthen his power in the country.
The argument was triggered by the decision of Uribe to remove Chávez's commission to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels to release hostages.
Uribe "slipped in the face" with his decision to Venezuela, criticized Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone here caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" - that's a sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was spoken by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was so upset at the recent Ibero American summit that he was silenced by the loud remarks of this leftist populist.
Germany faces lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages this year despite a strong boom.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to Hans Böckler's estimates, in 2007, employed people can actually expect to receive lower wages than last year.
"The blame is on small increases in salaries, increases in value added tax and increases in prices for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% was correct and reasonable in this situation in the new year.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be in such difficulties to require loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, to quote the newspaper of this social democratic policy.
On Tuesday it was published that the price explosion of food and petroleum products drove inflation to its highest level in the last 13 years.
Overall, in the annual price comparison, they increased by three percent.
Venus is the infernal twin Earth
Despite its life's hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar to what was supposed to be. Venus Express, a European spacecraft on Venus, recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortex at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is being flashed.
Now the European Venus Express probe has produced evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, wrote Christopher Russel of Los Angeles University of California in Science magazine Nature.
According to the well - known theory of the origin of primary matter, life could have been created on Earth by lightning, and storms reportedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
That was not the case with Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, something living on the surface of Venus could hardly be found. The atmosphere is about 100 times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Venuše may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but he is the twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth by matter and size, began to develop completely differently, is the basic question of the Ace mission.
Since no probe has been sent since the early 1990s solely for the purpose of studying Venus, the start of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results that brought several articles of Nature closer together did not just emphasize Venus’ uniqueness in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more similar to the Earth than previously expected," said Esa.
In addition to the already known wind vortex at the North Pole, scientists found a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which revolves much faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air currents of the Northern Hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km it is almost the same size.
This planet, called Jitřenka or Večernice, will orbit the sun in almost 225 days.
But it rotates much slower around its own axis, one day on Venus, it lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble the Earth with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bars, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
But on Earth it remained in the oceans while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's encounter with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands that the party's disputes be brought to an end due to the acceptance of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office.
Indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls on the great coalition to put an end to the feud about the Dalai Lama's acceptance.
"We should not present ourselves on the outside as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt's economic paper.
At the same time, he expressed his sympathy for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," said Köhler.
While the Federal President emphasized that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent Merkel from standing up when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The joint chancellor did not abandon the traditional single China policy.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Secretary of State Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was therefore attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the foreign policy of the coalition.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office, German-Chinese relations worsened.
Not only did the Chinese Government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of foreign ministries in both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao emphasized China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions also located in China, is trying to separate itself from China.
Schäuble warns against similar riots that broke out in France
Street fights with police, gunfights, cars on fire. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from becoming violent on the street, calling on the Federal Minister for the Interior.
The barricades were on fire, the rioters were shooting shotguns at the police. After serious youth unrest in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create such social tensions in our country, which will break out in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said in the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Apparently, not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to solve problems, said Schäuble.
This does not just mean migrant integration.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we record the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
Over the past night, juveniles have fought hard street fights with police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
More integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, this should still be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is "over average".
Above all, a greater number of study opportunities must be provided.
Kolat emphasized, "We have to give juveniles hope."
However, the President of the Turkish municipality added that, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many of the migrant’s families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "We still have to pay attention."
We have to "make it quick for teenagers to start working and learning."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly calm.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burning trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces have been taking care of peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, after visiting the suburbs, Secretary of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie has announced.
In the riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's riots swept in.
Disorders caused a Sunday traffic accident in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the D.A., the police are not to blame for the death of teenagers.
In the realm of Angela "The Clouds"
The chancellor's remote output documents that the coalition is at the end of the program and that we can't expect anything more from it either.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferently sounding and content poor speech at the general debate of the Bundestag, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should ultimately manage.
Angela Merkel responded to her regrets that she was too focused on foreign policy in one very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what critics are up to.
In the Federal Assembly, she showed everyone how much she deserved the blame.
Merkel didn't have any real interest, let alone a sense of trouble in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" presented herself: a politician who excels at others, who flees into foreign policy and even there speaks only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it is constantly being praised for the conclusions of the Heiligendamm Summit, but it no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And yet, such self-praising - such impropriety would have been forgiven by the CDU chairman two years ago.
Now it is limited to idle phrases that might make her more popular with people.
This approach harms its imij pragmatists, who do not need to flatter, because they solve problems.
But in Angela's Cloud Empire, internal political problems are marginal.
Child poverty and the worry of low-wage people?
She's got a few minor sentences left on the subject.
It's worth noting how often Merkel talks when it comes to child encores.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning, so she can say at least part of the correct sentence.
As soon as things get too specific, he stumbles like a total stranger.
Offense Attack
With Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorites, the debate of Republican presidential candidates for Youtube has been heated in a heated debate - and they both now have to worry about the outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is reflected on the first topic.
Mitt Romney bids his opponent Rudy Guiliani that he has made New York a refuge for illegal immigrants.
Giuliani reacts quickly with sharp regrets: "I believe his own house was just one such refuge," he answers and bids to former Governor Massachusetts that he employed immigrants privately without papers.
As the Republican base still has no clear favorite, eight presidential candidates use these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, internet-based users filmed and over YouTube sent videos serve only as such clues of a key theme.
"This is exactly the kind of policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain pitches to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam's veteran McCain does not spare his regrets or Romney for refusing to condemn the agonizing method of interrogation called "Waterboarding" in which heating is simulated.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither war in Iraq nor methods of torture are among the important topics of the campaign.
The audience bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This shows where the weakness of both favorites lies.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains condescendingly and asks the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for being a supporter of abortions back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian life.
The day after his resignation as Chief Commander of the Army, Pakistan's ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
That concludes eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
President of Pakistan Parvíz Musharraf took a presidential oath on Thursday and will remain in the presidency for another five years.
Pakistan’s television broadcasted a live ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he took power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning as chief commander of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the emergency that Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will cancel the state of emergency soon after his oath, thus fulfilling another of the demands of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, after declaring the state of emergency at the beginning of November, occupied his inclined lawyers, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan and four others were injured.
A military spokesman said the bomb went off on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Krautrock Fathers Return
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia band took up their electronic synthesizers at the concert in Berlin again.
The revival will include Live 1974, a haircut from the most successful period of the band.
They were already significantly better known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three settled gentlemen, who at first look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone's got a box, cables and buttons in front of them.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
On his left is a fifty-seven-year-old Michael Rother with a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who bows focused over synthesizers, is on the right from the viewer's point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, inadvertently, a traditional song will emerge.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians much.
Among the lovers of Krautrock, Harmonia's revival caused a great deal of excitement.
The repeated questions showed that this name may be part of a collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not long enough to miss the band for 23 years.
But why couldn't even a German celebrate his still living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when they value musical style, mistakenly called Krautrock, in England and America more than in their own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the Echo Award to the surviving members of the Can Cologne group, the hall was full of questions about German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the La Düsseldorf and Neu! groups in their speech, the audience’s wonder no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with them at Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and idolizing abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia unnecessarily overloaded memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time did not have the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius have previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement of Berlin's theatre Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a gramophone company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but gained his reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at that time was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the band Cluster into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, they lived as members of a commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil like a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a Spitzweg artistic existence.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the trash can.
Many of it was kept by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music by Harmonia" and the following was called "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting the roost wasn't just about self - knowledge.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been edited in front of a record small, barely 50-membered set during the Griess concert.
At that time, Rothera expressed his wish for members of Harmonia to exult and occasionally practice.
For Roedlio and Moebius, that was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in an esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
Cluster's band came back to life in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His record company Grönland took the goal of Krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was at that time considered Roedeli's solo work.
The body resurrection of Harmony will take place in Berlin's House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woltronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
The present will be British, Julian Cope, the old punk and author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
The founder of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will attend.
This outlines the overall extent of the effect of the Krautrock on future pop music.
Harmonia will fill the empty space of the famous group.
Brian En's sentence accompanied by the strangest sounds hovers in the hall: "The one true music, her future."
There are pictures of a producer with Harmonia in a peasant's seat.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the screening of other black-and-white photographs, on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
Not by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to remove the instruments from the ever-heard self-made tones.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to tech immersion sticklers.
The congregation of the House of World Cultures does not change that either.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, there's a whisper under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place, there's an emphatically singing "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find roots rather than in blues at music universities (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts out "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia is not going to let himself out of peace now.
Even the most obvious part of the scene is carefully thought out.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question will either rob a person of his nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the Balkan war appeared.
But neither of them is convincing.
The draft of films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Even an actor like Richard Gere can't stop him at The Hunting Party.
Good news first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the bleak background of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he has played in many lovely, unsavory roles in cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences on Buddhism forever, one can't wait to see another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does a hunter become a prey (Why do movie names have to be so long and tangled nowadays?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could have become if fate and the film business were not so merciful: a man who has long since had his best years, but still retains a remarkable charm as a ruin like this.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinemas this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the Balkan war.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, then one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television film is changing too soon into shooting and action.
The film will leave something very similar to Cobra 11, without a freeway, but for the war.
On the film The Hunting Party, you can explore why so far the Balkan War has failed to make a really good film.
The story of three American war reporters who go after "the fox", the Serbian chief war criminal, would in a different time and under the direction of another director and writer (here is both Richard Shepard) possibly become the new "Apocalypse".
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is unable to do, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauchery and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft also prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
We can finally write off The Hunting Party after the reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film have done what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s criminals have failed to do in the last five years: catch criminals and leave them with the righteous revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of The Hague.
In doing so, this film has a profoundly human message.
It condemns that Karadzić and Mladić are still at large, and suspects Americans and French (here they are exceptionally united) that they do not pursue persecution intensively under secret political agreements.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar, women come to us with the famous poem of Brecht.
It's a wooden mask of an Asian demon on a writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, remarking: how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are exactly those swollen heads that indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the topic of war in the Balkans.
Recently, these newspapers reported that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
One can add: No good film has ever been made about South Africa.
Almost always true: When a star wanders around a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the boundary of a break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio will be created.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films must probably mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or " Lead vest" - were not in any way celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder appears at home immediately on two screens, we know too much about this world's conflicts.
Writers then do not have the ability that is needed to flawlessly tell good stories.
"Being or not" or "Great dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime actually ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcastically distant artistic view as novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "Balkan War," he said: "The image lies only in the fact that some things never change.
Large cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is reaping criticism for the Olympics' disclaimer
The resignation of the mayor from holding the summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has come upon fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, urges realism in the estimation of chances.
The main executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday marked this decision "in terms of business, unhappy".
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporty political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on an amended timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday at his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy", von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on the nomination of Munich for the winter games in 2018.
"This preference means for us that we have no realistic chance with a time plan of 2028."
Yet this dream is not over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust’s statements regrettable.
It is the impression that Hamburg does not want to compete for the organisation of the Olympic Games over the next 25 years.
"It is too soon to destroy your chance by calling the plans buried at this early stage," said President HSB, Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
The waiving would be contrary to the testimony of the Senate chief at the General Meeting of the German Higher Sports Association.
Von Beust did not report Hamburg’s candidacy for the University in 2015 as a replacement for the organisation of the Olympic Games.
It was only in the last week that the University Sports Association Hamburg nominated for the candidate city.
The faction of the SPD in the Hamburg Parliament has accused the Senate of wasting valuable time that could be used to build flats in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was slowed down by the Senate for years because he bet on the organisation of the Olympics and excluded the construction of flats," said members of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook was still planning the Olympics, with the entire area later being used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympic Games were a great thrill to compete in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, crashed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever links the terms of Sweden to wooden boxes is not thinking about Andy Warhol, but about Ikea.
Is it?
Wooden crates currently produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's list.
Most of his on the list of ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type are falsifiers.
After Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" from 1968, comes internal research of the Museum of Modern Museet in Stockholm with the result that brought disillusionment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Museum of Modern Museet donated to its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm, which are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes, which were based on red and blue-white design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their designs, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but they are not displayed in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses at the time are now talking about 15 crates that rightly entered artistic and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol Brillo Boxy" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 some 100 cases were produced and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were made in Malmo for an exhibition in St Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, the chief conservator of Moderna Museet, also explored three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood were painted with basic paint and sharpened, they were painted with an oil white paint.
On the contrary, the 1990 copy structure revealed that the paint was applied without the previous basic paint coating directly to the plywood plate - in addition it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo Boxes," said the director of Modern Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six cases of his exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "core accusations" that were raised in the matter of boxes of soap powder.
But the organization still remains in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered to a hotel in Manila demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagoal Arroyo.
The rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government before attacked the hotel with tear gas.
About two dozen soldiers had already fortified in the building several hours before.
On Thursday, about half of them were court-martialed due to a botched attempt to revolutionize in 2003, including the Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his about 30 sympathizers.
Apparently, the military officers who were supposed to watch over him defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagoal Arroyo.
The government's loyal troops have sealed off the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security office.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of soldiers.

On Wednesday, the company announced that the average price per share is EUR 14.46.
