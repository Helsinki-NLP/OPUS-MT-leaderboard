Austria’s right-wing populist triumph, 29 percent combined
According to the first preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Austria, the visible weakening of both sides of the large coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties have resulted.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Korutan Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but it loses 5.5% of the votes against the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, ÖVP, who loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these large parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially of the people who provoked the early elections, literally a disastrous outcome.
Even at the beginning of July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advantage over SPÖ.
But the voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
As early as the first responses to the results, speculation was expressed about the possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers consider that this could happen on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party’s Bureau.
Such developments would probably facilitate the way to the ever-probable way out of the electoral outcome, namely to restore the major coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) they provisionally gained 18 percent and BZÖ gained 11 percent of the votes - but the Social Democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (then FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split off from BZÖ) on a common government that even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider is clearly betting on this development, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with either party and is expecting to return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party was still in Parliament, but it was slightly lost and fell between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties clearly crossed the 4% threshold and did not make it to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can cool off
According to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of collecting bugs in India could not be solved, some cooling of Czech-Indian relations would occur.
The minister said this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji.
"If it hadn't been solved, then yes, then a certain cooling would have occurred," he said after the meeting that took place on the Czech initiative.
After the hearing, Mukherji said that the executive could be very difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he stated that, in the case of Petr Švách, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Daržiling, under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji thinks it would be best to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself in the hearing.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicted, said the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party was already providing them with such help.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining with India the best relationships that have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as CTK said, he emphasized in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister avoided the answers to the question of whether he was promised to deal with things by the Indian party.
"I've had quite enough promises," he said.
Czech judges the battle for the sea floor
They shall proceed to the wall electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
But he's not interested in the continent, he's interested in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of United Nations personnel on Ocean Affairs and Law.
His boss, division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, watches the interpretation and occasionally completes it.
There's work vigour and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores, and other minerals can be found here, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Bottom greater than land
Today, coastal states began to bid for new submarine territories vehemently.
According to the UN Convention, they use their rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so - called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it has exclusive rights to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly, the continental shelf has that part of the seabed and its base, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the 200 nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf shall be accompanied by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last mentioned countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
The world’s response recently recorded Australia’s success, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater holdings.
But New Zealand, too, has gained the seabed area that the Commission admitted to it last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits that will flow from using the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other countries will submit their requests gradually.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean bottom area begins with a treaty declared the 'common heritage of mankind'.
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by the Convention established by the International Institution.
"The seabed, however, is no Klondajk", says Director Mikulka in exaggeration, saying that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They share them with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the common organization "Interocanmetal".
In 1991, according to the Convention, as did investors of a few other states, it acquired the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
He is authorised to mine in the Clarion Clipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The investor-explored area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken down there, it's a sort of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be mined there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian Rober Sandev division worker brings one such concept to show you.
It resembles a small potato or, in a bit of fantasy, a fabled shema that legend has it revived Golem.
German special forces were in the process of freeing the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were ready, but there was no deployment.
More details of the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt are gradually being made public.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the Ministries, both the Federal Army’s experts and members of the German GSG9 Police Anti-Terrorism Group, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Criminal Office, and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene of the liberation.
However, according to another communication from the speakers of both ministries on Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed, because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government allegedly adopted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the on-site action.
"Happily, that did not happen," said one of the spokespersons of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and also eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After being kidnapped in the desert area of southern Egypt, they moved hostages in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, they're safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the liberation of the hostages is under the care of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of his release.
No information is yet available in Berlin when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" all five tourists should fly with special forces one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has let a $700 billion bailout package for financial markets fall by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones index fell through hard.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and the leaders of both sides, the majority has not been found for a programme that should alleviate the turmoil in the financial markets.
After all, dramatistic action has made the advocates desperate to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called for the approval of a Member before voting, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to gain political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he acknowledged.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or by 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index value rose so that it would fall again sharply after the notification of the collapse of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to approve both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents record increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, next month's booking of tours increased significantly compared to the previous year - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the German’s desire to travel remains undisturbed.
In winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded an increase in turnover of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Union (DRC) stated on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Survey Institute, there are already increased reservations for autumn months.
Thus, according to the DRC’s comments for October, the turnover was approximately 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results are GfK numbers, which every month evaluates the reservation data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included booking tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, mainly trips to the US are sought, said the DRV.
With these routes, there's about one third of the bookings.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable targets among the Germans.
Mainly organized tours are on course, stated Chairman of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising energy and food spending, the cost is "more easily calculated for a client than for an individual organised holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can, among other things, save money by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so, compared to the previous year, a higher turnover will be recorded again - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Forever repeated pop, beer made of tuppences and prominents in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, TV host, and she wears a custom-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my clothes are secondhand.
There is one thing that connects us: we are not even three minutes in a beer meadow yet, and already photographers are throwing themselves at us and filling our memory cards - that is flattering, I am at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap costume has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist, and I live north of the sausage equator, and so my feeling of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a woman's costume or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
The only thing that gets special looks at a banana stand in chocolate is my apron.
One Munich girl warns me that I mistangled her: "On the left you're free, in the middle of a virgin, married on the right, widowed in the back."
I'm gonna flip my bow from the back to the left.
"Okay," he says and laughs.
Others don't deal with subtle flirting techniques so much and wear simple felt hats with the inscription "To Drunk to get dressed!" and stick on passersby naked butts.
The young man with such flashing tendencies is called Bob, he's from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks "gorgeous" with an extended "ooh".
That's what he's telling me after he's relieved of a just-drinking sap.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks are garbage cans.
Bob is one of the dreaded "Wildbieslers", as people in Bavaria are called freely urinating in public.
Others don't have the happiness of getting rid of alcohol that way.
Around 8:00 p.m., Oktoberfest runs around the area, with a crowd of paramedics who have to take care of poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they wear a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to beer meadows: empty there, full back again.
You can't see who's lying under the tarp of this coffin.
"It's you who can't go on," one of the paramedics calls me in response to my question and disappears in the crowd.
Police released the name of the accident victim
The name of a 63 - year - old woman who died in a hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon struck Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkey’s Diplomatic Horizons Spread
Long before Turkey began its efforts to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into Turkey's entanglement.
On the eastern bank of the Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, one of the best monuments to this failed imperial ambition stands.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in the Neo-Renaissance style.
Well, that's what the tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits at the end of platforms with a tower on every corner of the façade, looking to the undistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone's dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the vault, you can no longer have any doubt about the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gate the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatoli-Bagada Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to implement its ambitions to take over the Middle East through this railway, which was supposed to lead to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond the territory that is Saudi Arabia today.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their dorms were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by the frozen Cold War border, is gone.
British and colonial forces advanced from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came for Hydarpasha Station, too.
In 1917, an explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, they have been crumbling and history has been circling it.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the widening horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by the frozen Cold War border, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet one of the leading experts of the AKP on foreign policy, the Turkish MEP Suat Kinikloglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a squirming ride on the tracks that reminded the old-world rhythms of the well-known documentary Night Post, I arrived at the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state, which wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
In the west, she aroused suspicion, especially in Washington.
The cab brought me to the main tent of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and power stores, where middle managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to do early morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a center-right politician from almost any other European political party.
The jacket, the tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey to its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its entanglement.
Today they must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But there will certainly come a time," I asked, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want such a decision to take place."
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost by heart: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are as good for Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, ride these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of the two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Con who watched this building built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that European ambitions in the Middle East can now, for the most part, be in Turkish hands.
And while I was waiting at the port for the ferry back through Bosporus, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes in : As Guildford musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (the obituary, September 11) was in charge of Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district musical plan, he founded a year on this excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was to be 21 years old, but by the time Proteus sang the last time in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (a mythological shapeshifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to embark on any music that was presented to him - whether madrigals or Messiaen, alone or with the whole orchestra.
Music adaptability created by such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanging all the time.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for ourselves"?
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His baton technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor floral.
Wherever the music standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "drawn one or two soaking stones around the world".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author's note at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at Philosophical Faculty
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was intrigued by the simplicity and strong charge with which they affect the viewers, and by the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda strikes again with his bestseller
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle has already had considerable space, it now offers even more spacious interiors.
This is accompanied by enhanced engines, which increase driving comfort and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this one-space vehicle.
It is important to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
So the first thing we're going to notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in sales in other markets.
This is, for example, the case of Japan, a country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Almost a million pieces have been sold since the launch of Honda Jazz in Japan.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million sold pieces in six years.
However, Honda aims to make the new Jazz increase sales in its category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 estimates count 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, which means 6.7% of the total sale of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 pieces a year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the car company expects the year to end with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% of last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid of compact size with a length of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 pieces worldwide each year.
As far as markets are concerned, the Japanese producer estimates that 50 % of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will divide the old continent and Japan.
The launch of Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions increased in the new Jazz.
Its length has increased to 3.9 metres (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 metres (two centimeters more) and wheelbase to 2.5 metres, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
Enlargement of dimensions has also increased the interior space.
This advantage was achieved by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the luggage compartment in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur for the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement besides external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an 80 degree opening angle compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
With the second generation Honda Jazz, there are new engines.
In the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time with high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine has 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of Jazz - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and an emission of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"The Bee Car" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan was inspired in nature, specifically in bees, to develop technologies to protect against accidents.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes the role of flying bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, CEO of public relations for technology, research and brand development, BR23C is presented as an extension of four zones of the Nissan security shield.
The robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent collisions in vehicles of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
However, the most important are the composite bee’s eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles that are located up to two meters in a radius of 180 degrees before the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment the obstacle is detected, the robot mimics bee movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent collisions.
The biggest difference to any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are absolutely instinctive.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction by which it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as with bees.
So in addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent collision.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and to follow these data.
It does not require retention of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which allows it to function without interruption with only two dozen kB memory.
It may surprise you, but in memory, we're not talking about gigs or megas."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of precipitation, a technology where Nissan predicts use for serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination and avoid obstacles along the way.
Enjoy your fear before you take a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury, apart from having enough capital to give away injections, does not lack ingenuity.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages from banks with questionable solvency, it created a popular-learning game on the Internet called "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a mixed-up hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look gloomy to think twice or twice about whether it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site more suitable for young people than for the general public.
And what happens when the game is over?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
At least that's something, because buying a house better not to talk about...
Morgan Stanley opens up his MUFG capital
The bank house Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank to spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital, was joining its center.
A week after they uncovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was planning to buy 9.9% of current shares of Morgan Stanley at a uniform price of $25, which represents a total sum of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in obtaining convertible securities that provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average uniform price of $29, i.e. 28% below his current rate.
Morgan Stanley's shares were still 6.79%, and they hit $23.07 at around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of bank holding," explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which is intended to enable him to expand his activities, but it also puts him under the control of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest aces to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for roughly $8.5 billion.
"We thought until a week ago," Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to limit the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley securities by 7% less than its book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction of about 20% of the stock's earnings.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for some time at a price of 50 % above the exchange price, i.e. at around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the group’s spokesman refused to provide more specific information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast of the Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan made it clear that since the end of August, he had "tangibly" lowered his balance.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the group, because its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of default associated with the debt have increased sharply.
These costs took on the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivors" from the big Wall Street investment banks following the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that they had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa on Monday at Quito.
Relaunch the republic around the XXI century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put forward a proposal for a new Constitution for voting, following the model of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted 'yes' in the referendum.
"No" according to these results was 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0,7 % of the ballots were blank.
In order for the Constitution to be adopted, it had to win half the votes plus one.
Two polls carried out at the exit from the polls and a calculation of the NGO predicted a clear victory of 'yes' on Sunday, with a range of 63% to 70%.
After all, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night to Monday.
"The Constitution has won the whole line," he assured and congratulated Ecuadorians at Guayaquil Governorship, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the OEA observation mission, took place peacefully, concerned the text on 444 points building a 'new socialism' promoted by the President.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the state's power over economics by allowing it to "plan the development" of a country living primarily from oil extraction by foreign companies and from foreign exchange, which is sent by its emigrants.
The proposal backed by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, which will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year mandates and have the opportunity to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution consolidates the principle of free healthcare and education, which the President began to implement in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thereby terminating the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of US drug operations.
19 Hostages Freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando took the attack of the kidnappers of 11 tourists and their eight - member escorts who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were alive on Monday and safely transported to the Egyptian capital.
An Egyptian commando liberated them in Chad during the morning.
Hostages arrived around 3:30, apparently in good shape, on board a special plane to the military base al-Maza, closely adjacent to the Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred without being able to express themselves in the press, on board helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, the peripheral residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are quite well" and "no ransom was paid to the kidnappers", said Egypt's Minister of Tourism Zohehr Garrana on the runway.
Since its capture on September 19 during the safari in a four-wheel drive at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of safari.
A leader in Egypt’s security forces indicated that 30 special forces who approached the site on board two helicopters set off on the run just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of Egyptian special forces from the unit "glitter" were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by secret agents and the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people from our secret services, from special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the eve before the Sudanese army declared that on patrol they intercepted a four-wheel-drive vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six of them including the Chadian commander and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the movement for the liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - The silent majority of the culture resort
The debate on cultural funding fills the pages of newspapers with headlines and is the topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to pillage poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national landmarks that are starving?
What politician dares remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organisations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Society for the History of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered into 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy to uncover history, preserve a pile of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a few coins.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, driven by hopeless protests when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we going to see the grandstands for history and monuments?
Benelux Governments from Fortis State Bank
Benelux states will help Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch bank, which was the first to get into trouble in Europe because of the widespread effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalization: three countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has capital participation in Hungary, with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch Governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition, agreed on this.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be seen as precedents in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been spreading in waves for more than a year.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets.
With absolute certainty, the bank will sell some of its equity holdings, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The shares of Fortis started to fall sharply last week, and by the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis appeared in the Institute.
But analysts agree that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's securities fell by only 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year minimum.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the group’s total market capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s leaders, this is unrealistic.
Moreover, the management blames the fall of Fortis’ shares on the overseas market for the $700 billion US package’s acceptance plan.
On Monday, the stock increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx, the new CEO, was appointed as head of the bank.
The money institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian Government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There has been no panic between bank clients, and branches have not been taken by attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also purchased several leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with a candidate based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the fox's coop," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor prescription drugs.
The insurance company shall make premiums and amounts paid in the case of claims dependent on the health of the candidates and, if the risk is assessed as too large, with or without insurance.
In the past, they sent the persons concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer from the pharmacies will easily find out what drugs the person has bought in the last year and a half, which will draw the program itself out of what kind of disease he suffers and what his condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering drugs, this refers to his virtually uncontrollably high levels of blood fats, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of the program are in circulation, some of them determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so there is almost no work left for the insurance company except for paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
Disadvantages include that many medicines can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-enhancing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, whereas the first mentioned difficulties are not.
In order to request and process data, special companies were created that would ask the patient for permission before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so, even though they have not punished them for their negligence so far.
Some companies have recently already been processing the results of laboratory tests, which combine with data on the medicines used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, while controlling their use will become increasingly complex.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give the authorities the power to control businesses specializing in data provision, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his program in such a way that the transfer of data is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permission in question can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not enter into a contract with it.
So the chickens are somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill after all.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union and India will double the trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this issue was dominated by other, mostly global problems, the agenda for the ninth meeting at the highest level.
Today, there will also be a Franco-Indian summit, which will primarily involve cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power, which should be given more opportunity to speak on international affairs, but the Member States have not yet managed to find a common denominator in support of the continued membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was neither further discussed at yesterday's ninth summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the Union, President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana, welcomed India’s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the trade turnover within five years, or increase to more than EUR 100 billion.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an excessively ambitious objective.
In a sign of this, 26 existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were legally aligned, so air transport was also given green light in the future.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would like to sign a free trade agreement.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, respectively, has been condemned by both sides in all its forms and has called for an urgent convening of the UN Conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha Round of Trade Negotiations, although both have a large share in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
This was also agreed by India, as well as by the need to conclude a global agreement at the next year climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister travels to the French capital, where he plans to enter into a trade on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will receive mandates to build 20 billion euros worth of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the agency reports, the agreement would have been valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmess, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take up 171,790 sqm of fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the Inauguration Festival in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – at 264 square metres of exhibition space.
There will be a meeting with the press at Room Structurer Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to data, the importance of books by foreign authors is still diminishing in relation to total Italian production, mainly in relation to literature for children and adults.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, was found flying across the desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that still remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying the day he disappeared" he said at a press conference.
So the sheriff made it clear that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Agency (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the debris was identified, an investigation team was sent who eventually identified the aircraft: exactly Bellanca 8kcab, missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of the Fossetto's personal items were found with one pair near their dwellings in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossette's name on it, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, cash money and one jacket.
The search for Fosselt was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks alone flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world on a plane without landing.
His many records include a flight at 15.445 meters above the Andami, although with a copilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This, in short, is the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star house, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the vortex into this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional processing, there will be unexpected and unconventional communication, which will accompany the launch of Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
This way the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also start an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The project of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, when you look at the picture, you'll get the impression that the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative lumina8 technology, the new glk will be enlightened in different moments in all its little things, so that it will then reassemble in a single picture.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped area of car traffic through this advertisement.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way?
So now we know who Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never caused excessive problems.
She's never even met her opponents.
Group orientation is right-wing.
Founders come from Trivenet.
Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact, few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday night, they removed them so that they would not be recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made 144 tickets for the match available to Italian fans: all in name, easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and banned the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the news that will come from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case it is possible to give Daspo at least five years to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will never set foot in another stadium.
To happiness.
But now there is fear of emulation: that means more than 150 will join them.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not justify those who behave in this way", confirm from Viminal.
So, "seriously open eyes, mainly because of the national game on Wednesday in Lechi."
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia right now.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, it is a secret service that takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
In Bulgaria, that's not a crime.
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very little happy way) who is the director of the Viminal Osservatorium for a few weeks (he gained a place that was before Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Quaestor in Trieste, where Ultras Italia’s core supporter was located, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate leaders, but, of course, the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Osservatorian number one - crimes are attributed to the country in which they took place.
So far, this group has remained within its limits, so let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling at Mameli's anthem: it's not even a crime, but if you don't mind, it's rude..."
