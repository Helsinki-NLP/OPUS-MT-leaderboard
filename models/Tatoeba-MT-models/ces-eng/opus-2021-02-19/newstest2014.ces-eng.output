Black box in your car?
While American road planners are trying hard to find money to repair a crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into the dashboard of your car.
Devices that track every kilometre the motorist travels and transmits this information to the authorities are at the heart of Washington’s controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate the outdated system of financing America’s major roads.
Usually the flimsy projecting of motorways suddenly sparked an intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed to allow the government to use these small cabinets that would record miles and maybe even where you are going – and then use that information to compile the tax notice.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree whether to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for a mile of the road on which he drives.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, to test.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who plans to start monitoring miles for this state for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
That's what this technology is for.
The idea is that the Road Trust Fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans at gas stations, is down.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars go a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system of paying for a mile.
"This seems to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometres travelled.
It is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which can help reduce traffic congestion and create greenhouse gases.
California’s designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Committee on Transport, said that he also sees this as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also in favour of the idea that drivers will pay for mileage.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president for strategy in the organization Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 encouraged Congress to move towards a mile of payment.
Last year, the US Senate approved a USD 90 million pilot project to cover some 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing members of the population, whose daily life often means to travel many kilometres for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The hottest is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the biggest experiment in the country.
These drivers are about to start paying the state a mile-long tax instead of a gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is researching the project right now.
Illinois is doing this to a limited extent for freight wagons.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not just have supporters.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers’ cars were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"The Big Brother type of entertainment and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs the strategy and operation management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project continued, the US Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into fully-fledged tracking devices.”
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably spread to register daily trips and individual arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few countries that is trying to find the available technology that would enable the state to track how many kilometres the car will travel, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hunting for such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was originally not involved in the aid action to the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging legal liability insurance market, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they'd run away.
But this device that it is testing attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only delivers limited information that is regularly uploaded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to go if you don't follow their speed and location," says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have emerged in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometres travelled by all citizens of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay extra parking fees, to provide insurance by mileage, and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to participate because of the value of the benefits offered to them," says the city's projection document.
However, some transport planners would like to know whether all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge substitute problem.
Officials of the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could solve the problem of a bankrupt Road Trust fund very easily by raising the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical operations when it is enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
The ČSSD negotiates for Sobotka.
Social democracies are crumbling, poplars and grandmothers are talking and preparing a common approach.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with well-played partners, who will put a list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The ČSSD ambassadors will then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political grémium and, above all, forced convicted liars to resign.
Only he is the confirmed negotiator for the party, the other members of the team will be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the grémium and now to the citizens.
You shouldn't lie in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after the meeting of the narrowest leadership of social democracy.
He added that he was not attached to the post of First Vice-President.
"I will communicate my decision on November 10th at the CSO," said Hašek.
Similarly, Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the Jeroným Tejc parliamentary club spoke.
However, he pointed out that he was elected only two days ago.
Both Members then said that they would do their best to make the 50-member ČSSD club sound with one voice.
Michal Hašek gave the crown to the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decision of the party authorities."
So another lie on the air.
Or perhaps, in calling for Sobotka's resignation and his elimination from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August injunction decided 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the party's Prime Minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, created a powerful army of enemies by calling the IOC until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this institution and the media with a bunch of gossip and rumours, eventually recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be powerful laundry washing, signs of dark alliances between Zdenek Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
A friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
They bubble disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The warning is the words of Ostrava's mayor and of Sobotka's ally Peter Kajinar: "I signed Chart 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots."
If the DOJ were to meet this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
Traitors will bury their heads and stay.
And the currently winning ČSSD leader ends up nicknamed Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doktor about problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a tiny smile, and then he just takes a deep breath, "It's hard."
The cooperation with the organization team of the 2014 Sochi Olympics is, according to Martin Doktor, a little more complicated.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on essential things not so much.
For example, we've been prying for three months to give us the official label of individual villages so that we can do a number of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They're still communicating in a lot of things.
Is the Olympic village at least finished yet?
But it's no longer a catastrophic condition.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, that's what it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26th as a vanguard, it will still smell of glue.
And if they don't make it, what will they be?
President Putin would have driven an army there?
That's exactly how it's gonna go down.
Just so it's not that Olympic village = Potemkin village.
Rather, they are in danger of failing, for example, to adjust the roads, to fail to complete the details.
They may be in such a state that we'll have to bring our boots from the London games.
But I believe they'll sort it out somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number is changing.
Figure skaters, for example, are probably gonna ride in that three-way drive.
Nobody has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there on January 26th.
What the houses in the Olympic village will look like, we know.
We even measured some of our own things by subway so we wouldn't just believe in sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what's the mission chief doing 100 days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing a routine agenda in terms of communication with the Organizing Committee in Sochi.
Putin promised the environmental Olympics, he's being squandered by a giant secret dump.
Winter sports fans are cutting the meter to the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, while others are looking at their preparation with increasing concerns.
Russia’s Olympics, even if they start in February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to fail to fulfill the promise that preparations and games will not disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After all, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a bar built very high, Canadian games entered the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to organize games with "zero waste" has long since been taken over.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a huge landfill of construction material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Thus a landfill full of building material, tyres, canisters and insulation foam was found in August by environmentalists, which immediately reported.
The Russian authorities repented and the dump disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters got a look at a dump the size of three football fields.
Not the only one, in the area of such places there were several, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian railways, a state monopoly, are working on the site, which builds about a 60-mile journey between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
One of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin, has led a company that has already swallowed 280 billion rubles.
In August, the railways fought against the founding of a sub-contractor.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu river, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here will contaminate the soviet water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimaev of the ecological nonprofit organization EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem with the Russian Organising Committee and Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison: Sochi games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics cost 43 billion.
Last year's London games cost only 19 billion and the vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected while working at the sport and infrastructure exhibition.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth to protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are coping with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates got as an assignment to design a house on the plot, which lies on the corner of two streets, while the land itself is somewhat sloped.
The request further stated that there would be two generations living in the house who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping property.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place in the design."
"Three different functions of the house are connected several ways through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their privacy," the designers explain.
Parents’ household is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories bind.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in various final modification of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been molded with boards, the part where the office is plastered white and the remaining elements remained in clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, making the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
Parents’ household, kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
Connecting the interior with the exterior underlines the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues into the living room.
Kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs up the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall through them.
That's what the architects were trying to distinguish the house from the others and squeeze something unique into it.
The young couple's household is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room combined.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living zone with dining and kitchen part in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the lobby and then climbs up the staircase.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, teachers and high and high schools in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've seen more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the lecture of the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovec in the pre-election period, even received a retaliation in the form of an uninvited invitation to the celebration of the state festival of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer brave, and the visit of Miloš Zeman enabled: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Kolín Commercial Academy, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of the promotion of politics at universities.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same thing as staying mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the ČSSD presidents, who are simultaneously serving as a Member and a Governor and, like them, degrade both professions?
Because that's what you're saying to people, you can handle both of these challenging functions.
I know, we have here the example of Michal Hašek, who can even handle several dozen functions at once.
I don't think that's an example of a person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who prefers to leave the post so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the office of dean is that you will be violating and the policy of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current presence at both posts as an advantage for the University.
But you'll be able to help your school without staying dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion to my own and rector Miroslav Ludwig's.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may get counted by voters in the next election.
And that doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovice, bubbling cabbages don't add chemistry to it.
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut want to produce in the coming months in the Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
Since 1925 he has been producing healthy delicacies here in the traditional way, i.e. by pedaling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, it's a rarity.
Our worker found a ten-mile route behind the shift.
Each of the ten tanks can accommodate 15 to 30 tons of cabbage, one can be filled with three shifts," said David Kladroba, director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
The cabbages are transported directly from their fields to the company by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko.
Fruta staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the brooms and throws them into the ring.
From there already sliced cabbage falls into swimming pools at a six-metre depth, in which struts are tirelessly working dressed in white clothing and boots.
That's how they dissipate the unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and loaded with water.
"The green ring matures for six to eight weeks with spontaneous milk fermentation without any added substances supporting fermentation," the director emphasized.
The natural process corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, individual layers of workers pour through salt and cumin.
Cabbage after fermentation goes to the filling line.
Packed in sweet and sour water into sachets or jars and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies cabbages mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “co-operate” with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence snitch, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to give evidence to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
On Thursday, German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum, and he discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, who was sent to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to act as a defector to the opposition and tries to criminalize political speeches with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defense.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
Tensions in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when claims were made that NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament, who runs a parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if any opportunity were to question Mr Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US,” it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a Member of Parliament on behalf of the German Green Party, posted on his Twitter post a photo with Mr Snowden.
Two German journalists accompanied him on their journey to Russia.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be “safe there,” said a member of parliament.
In his letter, Mr Snowden said that he faced a harsh and persistent persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
But he said that the whole world’s response to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and senior officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the discovery of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
We're sorry to kill, but we're innocent.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Red hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
During the reign of the Khmer Reds, which relied on a mixture of maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population.
This commander of the infamous S-21 prison was given a life sentence in 2010 by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan argued that they believed that they acted in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the true extent of the killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered Red Khmer's cadres to "treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Red regime, told AFP that she couldn't accept Nuon Che's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"He doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he hadn't given his orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she added, adding that the leaders of the Khmer Reds are "worse than monsters."
The "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer regime of Ieng Sara was also to stand trial, but he died this March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incompetent by the court in September 2012 due to dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Red Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 for the deposit of hand luggage on board during its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand luggage and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although they announced on Wednesday that passengers will be able to keep the whole can.
The new baggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier says that it will charge USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance, and USD 100 if passengers with payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's spokesman Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
The airlines started charging the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed in hand luggage hidden in storage as much as they could, so there was often no space in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take less stuff on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really isn't to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it very clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper storage space.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in line at Frontier’s gate can bring a bag for which he will not pay anything, while the other passenger in line for the same luggage will pay USD 100.
O'Malley said that the website and the check-in procedures will be modified to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new baggage fee will not be valid until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see another baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost Allegiant Air company later followed its example.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says Air Transport Adviser Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, it estimated that Spirit’s baggage charge would cost USD 50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former head of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers met with an unusual fee from Spirit for carrying luggage.
"Getting on the plane was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my career," he said.
I expected to see teeth creaking and arguing at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the entrance took place in no time."
Frontier will also apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice on the Spirit model.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
The water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly attempted to introduce beverage charges, but withdrew seven months later following passenger complaints and did not imitate any other significant airline.
Frontier’s last move to charge for carrying luggage if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline, its last effort is to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel dealers such as Orbitz from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than to do so through Internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the furthest way in this area.
In September, she started to give customers who bought via an Internet travel agency only half a mile within the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for flying miles to 25 percent of the miles from the route.
So a journey with Frontier 1000 miles long purchased through an Internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seats in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and money is being lost.
According to the financial results presented on Wednesday by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and traffic capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
By selling this airline, the Republic is also trying to solve Frontier’s financial problems.
For the fall of the NSA website does not blame hackers, but "internal error"
The mysterious National Security Agency reported last Friday that her website fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not an attack by hackers, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the e-mail announcement said.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the blackout was caused by the attack of DDoS (distributed rejection of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, the sensors of the online servers recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Previously, NSA spokesperson for ABC News reported that the Agency's internal sensitive networks were not "at all" compromised.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of online hacker activists claimed that she was responsible for eliminating NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target websites with information until the servers overload and the site falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
In recent months, the former super-secret NSA agency, which once got the nickname No such agency, has become the focus of public attention after a string of foreign and domestic surveillance programs and the target of biting criticisms, a composite product of alienating NSA secret files from the agency and their exposure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier’s profits fell as a result of a drop in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 % decrease in net profit on Thursday, which is due to a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft would comply with the ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September onwards.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, and the question arose as to whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not fill the estimates, and stock market shares in Toronto decreased by 8 percent.
On Thursday, state bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating from “higher returns” to “sector performance” with the expectation that the stock exchange would experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While smaller supplies of aircraft were expected, the profit margin in the transport sector disappointed us significantly," Doerksen said in the customer report.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders from the CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market skepticism will increase against this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will fight their way into the lower area of the market, which now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March and after several months of delay the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches modest 177 because potential buyers are waiting for test flight results to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and savings on the cost of this transport aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director, Pierre Beaudoin, expected that when the first aircraft was put into commercial use, Bombardier would reach its target of 300 binding orders.
On Thursday, the executives also assured analysts and media that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test plane has not remained on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call and noted that the ground check and software updates were scheduled during the plane's shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test planes should take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
Yet analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan for putting the aircraft into operation and will provide updated information in the following months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – although consistent with Bombardier’s internal plan – will probably strengthen our view that putting into operation will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
From USD 172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending on 30 September.
The adjusted yields per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover marginally decreased from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to IBES, Thomson Reuters’ analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft producer indicated that it had supplied only 45 aircraft a year earlier than 57 aircraft during the quarter.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
The contracts failed in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which does not change even as of 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low reception of orders and the overall state of the market disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
The income in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said that the yield in this division increased by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, marginal growth compared to 31 December.
Profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the realization of several large contracts.
The management staff stated that new projections would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google’s financial director Patrick Pichette, fell by 8.5 percent to USD 4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft producer and closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10 % drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
A cocaine addict's lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in jail.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information on to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The top defense attorney, who informed the drug mafia of a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42), after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, was to pass sensitive information on his drug smuggling activities to the underworld boss Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011.
Officers spotted Sarborough (32) leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, just having dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to misinterpret information on the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his associate.
At the time, all four suspects were being investigated in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After arresting heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million, together with GBP 200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison together with them.
Ditta (42) was passing information on to criminals for fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works with Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, had a shameful time in front of the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall occurred after Scarborough’s police investigation found him in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him placing 60 percent clean drugs under the lawyer's black golf glove basket.
Subsequently, Scarborough and Ditta, who had dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, were in a regular phone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two persons.
In court, it was said that there were traces of Class A drug in his hair, wallet, and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, and said he talked to a suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation was part of "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
During a police interview, he said that he ran an office at both his home address and the workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work.
However, after key arrests, the court heard that he had contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than a criminal lawyer? ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as an attorney and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it's gone far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation has thwarted as much as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta did not bring his profession a good reputation, but he dishonored it.
He's gotten too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and he's allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta refused the offence and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass information on to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately.”
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal lawyer in the criminal area the moment he started getting drugs from organized criminals. ”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organized crime groups, who have given him the task of gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and have confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cover of his profession.
A unit for serious and organised crimes in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted for three cocaine possessions and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and put you in our court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five others involved in the trafficking were arrested for 153 years in total for drug offences.
On his Ditta website, he held an online interview about himself, saying that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a dinner guest, he would like Mohammed Ali to be a motivation for the job and to state inequality.
He negotiated the government with both Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won 14 MPs in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of social democrats or representatives of YES.
But they are entering into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to argue the outlines of possible coalitions, Jan Kasal - a man who was in line with the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrei Babiš do not have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will remind us of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a brand new party.
"Experiences were minimal back then," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a frightening report and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply wiping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said a newspaper calling the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is the extended hand of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to Members," he said.
According to the Star daily, the bill effectively passes "complete control over the media" to the government, and Standard reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have "streaked a hard blow", and criticise the bill as "streaky".
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by the Islamic gunman in the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The anger of the authorities was turned on by Kenyan media as it broadcasts a security camera footage, on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looted a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by bringing in two journalists and a media executive for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after media pressure.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, along with the risk of “listing off” or may be denied official press accreditation.
The General Court shall also have the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is one fine enough to eliminate most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan 'live blogosphere'.
Politicians know that if they shut up the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," wrote the journalist of Nation Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenyan media as the key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the cuts imposed by the National Wages Agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries of around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, which thus ranks among the highest in the world.
The savings must be made, the young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea with what interest
More and more Czechs put their money aside.
Yet they do not reach the champions in saving in the region.
Most of the money is put aside by Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros a month.
A little more than the Czechs save even people in Slovakia.
This is the result of the Erste Savings Barometer survey in Central and Eastern European countries.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the savers' rankings, in Romania and Serbia, people saving products are still using very little.
For example, almost every other Serb saves "under the pillow" at home, according to the survey.
In the Czech Republic this year, the number of those who save more money each month has increased.
Last year, between a thousand and 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 percent of respondents put aside for various types of savings every month, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly deposit in year-on-year comparison decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is supplementary pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of construction savings is declining, and interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to the previous year.
Only 16 percent of respondents use them, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save money, most of them do not know what yields they make on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is remunerated.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents have the best knowledge of the profitability of their deposited money, with 73 percent of those surveyed over 50.
In an international comparison between Erste and the Czechs, 44 percent of people regularly use online banking.
Followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12-percent distance.
The UN celebrates the new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations is immediately starting to work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that now is the time to “rear above national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – the SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 Development Programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and implement our vision of the objectives of sustainable development, which builds on the success of the MDG.
The security concerns of Mozambique are increasing due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the Founding President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to call out peace slogans for a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
For fear of the future of her country, she traded her business clothes for a T-shirt decorated with the word "we demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo Party, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After a peace agreement in 1992, he became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely for open conflict to break out again in the country, but recent events startled foreign investors and locals.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake, because the discovery of large coastal reserves of oil and coal in the northwest can bring investment worth more than $50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and America’s Anadarko, over the next few years.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo claims that the government has triggered the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party on 17 September.
The violent assault of former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afons Dhlakam, the group leader, said the spokesperson for Renamo Fernando Mazanga for the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for launching conflicts because it said it was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to ease his fear of instability.
Mr Guebuza said to the French press office AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever was left of his power to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that Renamo is withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
France Télécom said that it meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but seriously," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate tensions between these parties, fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither is a good negotiator, and neither is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which sought electoral changes, has already said that it would boycott the local elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a dying movement to obtain benefits and financial gains from the government.
Renamo’s voting share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuba – which ends its second term next year – wants to destroy this country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a more party democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on a key road between North and South.
Most skirmishes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres away from the capital city of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely, export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” said Mazanga.
The instability has increased government frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development, and recent kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the country's future lies solely with the government and the President and that he should be the one to find solutions to problems," he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends like “models for a way of life,” says the author.
Tales of Thor may show that “gross power cannot be compared to clever craftiness,” while Arthur’s legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of the myths would be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene, ” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk works are already part of education," he said.
I've defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly instructing" authors and teachers are like a "off switch" in a captivating story with a "subliminal" message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and British National Tales, says: “You may have good intentions, but you’ll do better to keep them to yourself. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children requires a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end with a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly determined.
The old truth about it is better to show than describe.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed over the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can plunge into new comfortable seats and over their heads added a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is twenty-one computers that generate the image," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than classical personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician from the observatory.
Digitalarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of night sky, human body or ocean floor.
The viewers will find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of man.
Another similar device is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to show the purchased programs and their own works in the hall.
There's two shows on since Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut, and it's for adults.
In it, people learn about astronaut training, fly into space, turn to centrifuge, and then see the challenges of space astronauts face in illustrations.
The second show is for children and it's called the Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a reef whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano exploded.
The entire digitarium cost approximately CZK 50 million, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector 12 million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitalium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, between 25 and 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 THOUSAND OF INSERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 advertisements offering jobs, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 advertisements (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important media for publishing job offers.
Even in 2005, when the survey first took place, it was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) it stabilised at around 60 %.
According to the analysis, advertisements of job opportunities largely reflect the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in periods of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reference period, with less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said Pavlína Šťastová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies for both media.
Advertisers and managers, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the lead on the Internet.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, while large representations belong mainly to the service and working professions.
Of course, education is among the most frequently stated requirements expressed by employers through advertising.
Other areas under surveillance included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the request for foreign language knowledge was stated in 3% of advertisements, 37 percent on the Internet.
Only two percent of employers’ advertisements required an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Entitlements to 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
For workers' professions they are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical equipment, and the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employers shall also set out in half of their advertisements the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most often required skills, communication skills have long appeared in the first place in advertising.
In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, accountability, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is where a solo comical performance was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the gathered people jokes by an interview method.
Faye's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
Founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Carolines solo comedy, this year celebrates her tenth anniversary – together with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the point that they were too big to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes", the annual musical comedy benefit at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has spread, so has the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival emerged from non-traditional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll went up with his sitcom (cheersy spicy "League" on a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now he has his own comedy show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the Saturday night live program and "Parks and recreation", but she became most famous for the rapidly spreading series of videos "Markel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, snarky, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest moves of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comedian, but became a successful TV and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he held a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in Larry's entire work's comedy DNA," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he walks down the aisle between two buildings and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
The price of oil fell further to $96 per barrel
On Friday, the price of oil continued to decline as concerns about high stocks were offset by a report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-hungry production sector.
America’s oil indicator for December supplies fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European electronic commerce on the New York Stock Exchange during the late morning.
Thursday was 39 cents down, and for October it fell by 5.8%.
In recent weeks, rich oil reserves have burdened the price.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production have given rise to greater demand, which has shown growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which has risen to 7.8% in the third quarter after the last two weak decades.
Brent oil, an indicator for international oil also used by American refineries, fell on the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents to $18.58 a barrel.
Oh, no, Mr. Haschek.
We have a unique way of telling politicians that this is not the way it is.
There must be so much pressure on Martin Hašek to be deprived of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so slim.
Martin Hašek is covering himself with the promise he made, but everyone and the politician must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš has the material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
There's no apology in politics, there's no resignation in politics.
Mr. Haschek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm it, if you weren't exactly lying - here you see how difficult it is with lying), you leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless wimp whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, even a flawed person or a life-of-life skunk.
It may seem unfair to you that I address only you, but you are the leader and they are the misguided sheep.
And you're the leader, and you've always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to lower your ears for a while now, regroup your powers, sit down that shame and then attack again, but that's how guerrillas or backstabbers act.
You are, I repeat, a leader in your eyes, an alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court has blocked the regulation on the arrest and search of persons by the NYPD Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked a court order demanding changes in the program of stopping and searching persons in the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Federal Court of Appeal said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the decision of the city's appeal.
In August, the judge decided that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city's conclusions and corrective regulations have come to mind, including the decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
On Tuesday, the appeal court heard arguments for the requested postponement.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be removed from the case because she was in conflict with the rules of conduct for judges by not acting as a judge according to the requirement to avoid appearances of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement that she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search persons.
It established independent supervision to supervise major changes, including reform in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of the pilot programme to test cameras carried on the body in certain areas where stopping people is the most frequent.
In August, the city of New York agreed to terminate the method of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after the police search.
The oral justification for the city’s appeal is planned sometime after 14 March 2014.
Many civil rights defenders criticized stopping and searching tactics.
In some form there has been stopping and searching people for about a decade, but recorded searches under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, filed an action that became a case of group action.
Supporters of the changes to the program of stopping and searching persons by the NYPD claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and can influence the use of these procedures by other police departments.
Opponents claim that changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that money will be wasted, but a broader problem will not be solved when the police force is under pressure after several thousand people have reduced its numbers over the last decade.
The judge noted that it did not end the practice of stopping and searching people who are constitutional, but reformed the way the police department in NY introduced searches.
One-fifth of shopping malls face low attendance
This is based on data from real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague Bohnice, the Krakow Shopping Centre is opened to the public and will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
There are now 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance involves about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are the inadequately large center towards the location and the poor layouts, too many floors or complicated and unclear arrangement of passages or dead places of centers," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of the Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi retail real estate department, about a fifth of the shopping centers face low attendance.
The main reasons include, among others, poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or market oversaturation at the location.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Today, customers are rather conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New business centres must try harder to 'entice' their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupation of shopping centres is generally stable, even with some centres rising, because the landlords were willing to reduce the rent and rent some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (e.g.Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
According to Sylvie Samadi, commercial centres opened in the last two years have been pushing very slowly on the market.
However, there is a market place for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', aimed at buying and services of daily needs for the immediate population," Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague they see the space for the upcoming business center on Vítězné náměstí, and according to him they have a clear potential of Na Příkopě street and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, allowing traders to cover and expand to smaller towns for favourable rents and operating costs, and the space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of the Prior business houses, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková of DTZ.
90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million sqm of gross lettable areas are currently located in the Czech Republic.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, there are nine of them in Prague, results from data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France the Czech Republic lags about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check his tip.
Former editor of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods “to hack into the phone, monitor, and confront” to confirm the fraudulent tip of the love relationship that was to be involved at the time by the Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis at Old Bailey's trial said that News of the World caught false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned a private investigator named Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and infiltrate her privacy, but it was said in court that Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
"The state representative suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but a person who likes to swindle people's stories to see what they have to say," Edis said.
He said that the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, tracking, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
She obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, she needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say: “Of course he knows.”
Rumors about the love relationship Clarke was involved in were first captured by the NotW News Department when sources who were sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby were said: "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
The recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer, where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
While Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Pawlby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former Chief Rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former Rapporteur James Weatherup supervised the surveillance of Mrs Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail telling her: “I received a story that we are about to publish tomorrow and I would love to talk to Charles about. ”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as other prominent personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
At the trial on Thursday, it was said that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman while he was seeing a co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with other persons in order to hack into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
Uncovering the NSA Increases Social Paranoia Monitoring by the State
One peaceful day towards the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), a German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of an American forward patrol located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claim that the BfV had hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event triggered an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again insisted that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence options “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of US companies, thereby strengthening their international competitiveness or increasing their profits.”
But ever since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, began to reveal his valuable collection of classified surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading businessmen, no longer know whether to trust the words of the director.
Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data with which US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have achieved general paranoia about state surveillance of new dimensions.
The last straw came with the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been bugged for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the leading entrepreneurs are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY consultancy, German companies believe that the US now poses the same risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft.
However, there is no evidence that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies in all the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and have stated that it should seek to limit its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German Parliament that we should produce German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical refinement of the American spy agencies exposed by Snowden is still shocking for some companies who have so far believed that China is the biggest threat to surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have realized to a wider extent that data stored in the US falls under the jurisdiction of the US, and therefore are potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-American members have cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the USA after the US Prism data mining program was unveiled.
Jim Snape, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “Do we have a new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets, and that data must be protected at all costs.
Economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always happened.
"It has been a crucial topic for many years and it has not changed significantly during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
In general, business leaders do not want to boast too much about the countermeasures they have taken to possibly not give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi’s Board of Directors, says that it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the Board of Directors meeting to prevent them from being used as listening devices.
The German BfV advises managers to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign travels because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid cell phones are then discarded.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders in their specific areas of the global market.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," he warns in his BfV report.
The US warns its own society of economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, the National Intelligence Estimate introduced France, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second row of perpetrators involved in hacking activities for economic correspondents, just behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free company concluded that, as far as economic espionage is concerned, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, stated this month in one of the talks: “The services know quite well that all countries, even when working together to combat terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a tangled wrestling ghost in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdosta, Georgia was found on January 11th in a straight-up tribune behind the high school gym where he went.
Sheriffs' investigators from Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old rejects it.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died like the sheriff said.
"They believe it contradicts logic, physical laws, and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's supposed to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a body bag," he said.
Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
said Moore at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of a "positional asphyxiation".
According to Moore, however, the second autopsy indicated another cause of death.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he exposes enough evidence in Johnson's death case to warrant an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he'll ask the FBI to execute it.
The Deputy Sheriff's Office of Lowndes was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to put all the surveillance video footage that the investigators have viewed.
The juvenile’s parents hope that the videos will contain a clue as to how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in case of child allergy to food at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the US government because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergy in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide for schools with information on how the teacher’s congregation and staff are aware of children’s food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline at their disposal – the most frequently used EpiPen automatic injector – in order to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone's sticking in my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "Itches my tongue".
Parents of intersexual children may choose “undefined sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an ambiguous genital system.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to list any sex for such children and allows them to list sex as “indeterminate” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to make hasty decisions with their children for a gender-determination operation and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
After many years, according to the BBC, one intersexual person said: “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I'm going to stay plastered by a doctor, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that out of 2,000 children each year, one is born that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, genital glands (eggs or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and identify it instead of waiting and following the psychological and physical development of the child until the surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determining problems, said that the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
Sex determination can be performed without surgery and then wait for identity to evolve.
Knowledge of how a child develops sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not linked to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These traits can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital system, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the work area, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify male, female or “third sex” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognised "sexual" person to win a court appeal so that she could retain the status of "undetermined" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, German passports, apart from M (man) and F (woman) will also have a third designation, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighboring France, according to the news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “sex theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic online website also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “As the world is being dragged to a new state, when gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization upside down.”
A newborn mother from Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would prefer to see children be given sex at birth.
"Parenthood itself is stressful without any further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And for about ten years, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be erased and redrawed.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, with sexual affiliation being a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make a wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel about their sex when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The ongoing theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex was docile.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – how parents raised their child – affected children's genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theory became questionable.
The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged because of badly circumcised, he recommended that they castrate his child completely, remove his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had his surgery back to the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still use this model.
But in the '90s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared "discontent with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but an ambiguous sexual system.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfying life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
He got female hormones when he was 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 he was sent for vaginal surgery.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After I was born, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genital system.
After he learned the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses, and had his breasts removed,
Surgery caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of Advocates for informed choice, based in California, is concerned that the German law "calls on branding and stigmatization".
"Many activists fear that the German law will achieve by encouraging parents to make a quick decision and choosing 'uncertain' for the child," she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We think it's better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.”
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is going to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a young child should not be able to wage at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said that the German law would "give powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
He's got a vagina, but he's got no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, 29 - year - old Katie is married, and as a student at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as an intern at a children’s psychiatry.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law will give parents some room to take their decision quickly," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run some tests and think about it and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman".
In this respect, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child decides with which gender he identifies more – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk spilled gasoline all over the house: He threatened to burn it down with his own family!
Tensions were increasing, fear was increasing.
The man threatened to burn the whole house down.
As a result, all available police patrols in the area, as well as the fire brigade from Mladá Boleslav and the volunteer fire brigade, set off on the scene.
A police negotiator came to the scene, who tried to talk men out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to burn the house down.
So a task force must have broken into the house, defused the men and chained them up.
The aggressor then ended up in a juvenile hospital, where he was transferred to an alcohol detention station.
Finally, the fire department filled the house with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
A man didn't give a damn about a police negotiator, so a commando went after him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest advisor secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 nomination.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the eagerly anticipated book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine got a copy of the book coming in and announced on Thursday night that the president’s top coworkers had intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to estimate whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama’s fading hope of re-election.
According to a national-political correspondent for The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and at the White House, namely the former White House chief Bill Daley, to measure the effect that former Secretary of State Clinton would have on the election to move to vice presidentship.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisors – including Daley, former Obama’s campaign leader Jim Messina, and former chief advisors at David Axelrod’s White House and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was a representative of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make that move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not greatly increase the chances of Obama.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I have intensively researched a number of things and this was one of them," Daley said.
You must remember that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we thought, “Jesus Christ, what are we supposed to do? ”
While Daley described research as "decent care," Martin told Anderson Cooper at CNN that the re-election campaign had made considerable investments to see if this move would pay off in the election.
"In campaigns, such money is not spent on elections and qualitative research unless something is seriously considered," said Martin at AC360.
But it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential card shuffle.
While Daley said he didn't think that the president was aware of the potential changes, the former head of the office admitted that he was "possible", that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on removing Biden from the candidate.
"Perhaps," replied Martin.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a luminescent treat.
He came up with an idea when he read a technical treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes luminescent.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – increases the pH in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, so the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious", says: "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for GBP 200 you get about 2 grams of it."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, your pH levels increase, and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it's causing this fantastic glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because it's four times as expensive as gold.
And so every hill costs me about GBP 140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But its next product is to be even more ambitious.
He says: “I really wish I could make invisible ice cream. ”
Basically, it's impossible because of the refraction of the light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I figure we'll find some way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of jellyfish, artificially manufactured by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a cheapskate.
There hasn't been candy in my apartment for two years, and this year probably won't be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, the black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I look forward to every Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, out of 6.9 billion dollars spent, 1.2 billion are expected to go into costumes.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are the latest fad of fashion.
Sexy may not just be women anymore; foods like pizza, hamburger, and carrots can also be sexy.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the dead parade, and I bet the space men of Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans are spending $330 million this year on animal pets costumes.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny doggies.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kilos of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers candy, and Clark bars.
This is amazing news for 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, we consume 45 million kilos of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association around Halloween, almost 16,000 tons will sell.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never deciphered.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror behind the walls" and "The house of shock."
In fact, there are over 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that, according to American haunted houses, have a $500 million profit, and that includes those amazing photos that you're pissed on and your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will look at the picture and post a comment like "nice face".
And finally, a little something about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving pumpkin lanterns is like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the trend of a "baby in a pumpkin" started only last year thanks to the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up carving a pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Office, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Pumpkin lantern on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of pumpkins have grown this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting up their pumpkin weighing almost a ton.
Announced series of Land Rover racing
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as communication equipment.
The choice is improved brakes, service package providing access to the mechanics of Bowler Works, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The racers who come to the Bowler have changed. ”
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as an achievable journey to world class races.
We are pleased that we can offer them this trip in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that they will prepare contestants for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
The Defender Challenge will also offer a training and testing day in February as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
Chairman of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last one in the interview for Aktuálně.cz he said there is no other way out and every government that came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible glue.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the lifetime of the starting term within two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose otherwise next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a more balanced decision."
At the same time, President TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (about 300,000 votes lost compared to 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that the early elections would be, the ANO 2011 movement would be strengthened by Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
Turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret Ian meeting, said that he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of social democracy, commenting Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"Head of the Democratic Party as little boys go to the head of state to enable them to revolutionize the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was more skillful and intelligent."
"Because I have never seen anything so badly done in my life," said TOP Chairman 09.
And in the direction of President Zeman (who he met in the struggle for presidential office) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize the party."
The first laws have already been tabled by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally tabled its first draft laws in the House, including the Farsky Treaty Register, which was discussed by the House's committees before the elections, but fell below the table with early elections.
The Chairman of TOP 09, in an interview for Aktuálně.cz, claims that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 of "stealing" the ANO program by the idea of establishing a contract register.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply brushed off a proposal that has already started at the second Chamber of Reading.
Fire Departments have come to rescue the lost puppy, which is stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in the quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a little car accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog saw him trapped in a quarry.
Firefighters have fallen down the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire units, which came to rescue it after somehow trapped itself on a dangerous protrusion in a stone quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine - month - old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, surviving for three days alone until he was rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped, when he got into a small accident, they were feverishly searching for their lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday at about 14.15, a sharp-sighted doggie spotted Ruby stuck on a protrusion in a stone quarry 15 meters above the ground.
The technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the site and took the rapture down to free Ruby, using a transport bag for animals to pick him up from the rock.
The technical commander of the tech rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
It's incredible that someone saw a dog.
The technical chief of the rescue team, Peter Lau, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape. ”
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Looking at the rescue, I was scared. ”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in my arms.
The vet said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're so grateful to them, they were all just huge.
Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he might fall, but he remained there. ”
The fire department was great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't go after that 18-year-old Katy Perry.
This week, during an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said that for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" from 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he hit on her.
She added: “That was a long time ago, and now he is very kind to me. ”
In a statement of Thursday Jagger's (70) representative said that he categorically rejects, that Katy Perry would ever make suggestions.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared this year on the Rolling Stones concert line.
Her new album "Prism" debuted in the first place this week.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave cause to stories of passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic advantages of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this did not translate into headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws to suit them.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continued inconsistency would be a cheap concession to Brussels for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
Moreover, so old that it became a dig, a journalist's duck that "independence means passport controls", I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting thought in this bearded tale.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London Chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
In the face of the euro crisis, the so-called Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, the party’s insider resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro is gaining influence as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of the Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came out of nowhere and already in the September federal elections captured almost five million votes, thus essentially "pushing" Free Democrats out of Bundestag (the equivalent of British Liberal Democrats).
On domestic soil, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a straitjacket attached to national economies through clinging to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit – that was only true for Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the area of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut income and public expenditure – which Germany urges.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is the deeper cause of European malaise performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – the code to support French and German companies at consumer costs – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for petrol in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even all the wage freezes in the world would not turn away the thawing of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering revolt, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that Germany would keep in check and allow Paris to stand up to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs and enforced its own economic policy in Europe as a card of political legitimacy, leaving the French economy worn out to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and moved the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – early warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that right-wing fission is automatically positive on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block can dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
In doing so, I think that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and the stance against the common currency will come together and the euro will perish.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn into something more free in the sense of “Europe (sovereign) nations”, already preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and draw close to the United States.
But Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed European order, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The government of the SNP in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement not promoting austerity in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011, thanks to the opposition stance on the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland were to vote for independence now just to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Advanced earlier
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanic women reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this
Experts claim that one of the triggers of early puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so evident in boys.
Former CNN rapporteur Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time trying to assure my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development such as breast growth, pubic hair and underarms and body odor appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age of first menstruation.
In the United States, the average age now is 12.5 years, compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years will pass before the first menstruation," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
There is talk of what activates the real beginning of puberty, but when breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before 8 years of age, the girl is considered "premature".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which children’s doctors can closely monitor.
Faster growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which may eventually lead to a cessation of growth and dwarfity in adulthood.
Recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he acknowledges that “repression of puberty can ease the problems of a girl’s behavior and her feelings that she is different from her peers.”
Understandably, there is another big problem: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to be menstruated.
"They are concerned that they can get pregnant or how they will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter began her period at 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not ready emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones are to blame in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty early.
Kaplowitz asserts that the most serious reason is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001 he helped to conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which links body fat to the timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American women and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although young boys are experiencing facial hair and shame, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as girls.
Other doctors participating in the conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added further complexity to this topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist from Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from their pediatrician on how to speak to their child.
"It may mean talking to a child sooner than you would have expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who are developing earlier need assurances that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalinka as an innkeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalinkova (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of pub and she was very good at it.
That perhaps the popular Czech actress planned a change of profession and started a business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinka appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right.
My boss even offered to hire me and I could make a living turning beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stick to what I do today, acting," Konvalinkova said with a smile, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and sometimes I eat Irish whiskey," the actress revealed her tastes.
Nadi, a longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový, appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I'm not allowed to drink in my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to keep that," the actor said.
Aircraft manufacturers argue about the width of seats, big orders are at stake
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, the second class seat width dispute was lit up for long-distance flights, which this month gave rise to a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.
The object of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for the economic class long-distance flights – not the one usually preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week Airbus called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The dispute arose at the time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-distance aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear part of the aircraft is distributed – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of economic performance requirements for design of new aircraft “mini-jumbo”.
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" will deliver 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the rival version of its A350 will deliver 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out by 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to prevail with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently he showed what the start of a new advertising war might be when he showed the financiers a picture depicting three people sealed in a restaurant with the headline “Would You Like It? ”
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
People are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49, according to the US Department of Health, increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it has conducted research that suggests that an extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus’s seats and says that it is not up to the aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
"It is really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they must do to be successful," said the cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
A larger space for elbows is essential for passengers, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute is a race in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to deflect the weights of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 percent more efficient for their latest design of two-engine long-distance aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend partly on the comparison of the 777X model design with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason why Boeing is doing this is to fill more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for thicker distribution, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"A four-inch seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus's business proposal is motivated by the threat of model 777," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer airlines a supplier catalogue to choose from.
Traveled aircraft vendors even carry a measuring zone to check the competitive arrangement.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't been sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more cab modifications by offering wider seats in alleyways for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft the call to new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but can discourage the wave of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people grows annually.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and by 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected, and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, in my opinion there is no doubt," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavý, who has been running the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
According to him, from January to September last year there were 165 HIV patients in the country, this year there were 176 of them.
From the beginning of the monitoring until the end of September tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
There were 206 infected in the Central Bohemian Region.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravskoslezský or 116 from Ústecký.
The least infected came from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were born with HIV, and they were transferred from their mother.
The nonsense in Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, the experts claim
A fantastic film from the Universe Gravity for some time after the premiere sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic.
In October, almost 150,000 viewers, according to the Union of Film Distributors, have seen it and made more than 26 million crowns.
Most reviews are positive.
Others, however, find certain discrepancies in it.
The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I like scientific and fantastic films, which I consider to be modern, dream stories.
Not to mention Gravity film, although it does look like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which doesn't sort of float in a weightless state.
Hubba's Space Telescope and International Space Stations are moving on significantly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some viewers blame the unrealistic effect and the entire behaviour of the fire in a weightless state.
They don't think the suits could take that kind of punch either.
Heroes in Gravity often get into a collision with different objects and suits without much difficulty can stand it all.
Neither the plot nor the plot have been spared.
Such an extensive tragedy in Earth’s orbit, according to some debaters, is unrealistic.
Besides, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technology.
People argue in forums about the "neural" behavior of ropes.
They say it looks like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the City of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen, but I can clearly say that I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to stick consistently to reality.
"More than the inconsistencies you mentioned touched me, how the space station with the degraded level of technology (last Chinese) is shown three times."
After all, China will be at the end of the decade, and it will probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors try very successfully not to break physical laws, so naturally oriented viewers appreciate the fact that during various cosmic collisions and collisions the moment of momentum, in other words, the dictionary of physics, also the view of Earth from space is very realistic, including the thin skin of the atmosphere and the polar glow flashing on polar regions.
Irregularities are bound to be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, when I read the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic debris in orbit appears in some scenes to be reversed before it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (an employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but no fundamental and sky-calling offenses against logic or natural laws have been recorded in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, it is evident that the creators have taken care of the veracity of the events displayed.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that Hubble's space telescope orbits a different orbit than the ISS.
The result is a very different speed and the rescue operation could not actually be performed as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the whole ISS rotated, therefore there is not even a clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both players to let go when they are no longer moving towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of vaccine could protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human exams, it is necessary to carry out further tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says that the first signs are good.
“We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that it can overcome all current approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies persecute all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine.
During vaccine mouse tests, which were subsequently supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that have not been vaccinated “calm down,” said researchers, a sign that nicotine has entered their brain.
Experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain sufficient antibody levels, thus proving expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccines were completely safe, they could be given to children before they were ready to try a cigarette, thus avoiding nicotine dependence.
But it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they will have no pleasure, and that will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists have said that the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for the Supervision of Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing coastal lease policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Committee on Corruption (ICAC) expanded its search to see if Mr. Obeid lobbyed several state ministers to rent him the Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and cafés, without having to participate in the competition after its expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by former Deputy Head of the Office of Mr Tripodi, Lynn Ashpole.
During the years of the talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, leases to businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of calls submitted at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodi and Mr. Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port department after working under Mr. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
“Was the development of commercial lease policy the topic of interviews during these phone calls?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty, Mr Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible officer
Israeli military aircraft hit a target on Thursday night in the Syrian port of Lazikija, confirmed by the responsible administrative officer of Fox News station.
This responsible factor did not specifically say what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
Associated Press reports that the targets were the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an air attack on the supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, Pečinka’s commentator spoke in such a way that he could agree with it, whereas Chairman Štěch was stirring up discord.
Hejtman Behavior was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and he remains a symbol of this misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses in the first place.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek has made the most of conversations on television impossible.
Based on this, I see no better option than for the ČSSD to propose as Prime Minister to Senate Vice-President Gajdušková, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think it would do a standard performance.
That's such a good solution, it's hardly anyone in charge to support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdušková could unafraidly build a minority government with a mere blessing from President Babiš and without the People's Party, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a believer social democrat.
This mini-minor government would have great stability, because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and that is what the President of Úsvit Okamura has committed himself to supporting.
President Babiš would eventually accept the tax progression, for he is bright and will see that he can't do it without it.
People wouldn't cause problems because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, there would also be a valuable minister, but if reasonably they do not want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, also well.
Let's give Alena Gajdušek courage!
Foreign workers with a visa authorisation may undergo a “authority” test
As the government intends to extend police interventions, it is considering the "authority" test for foreign workers with visa authorisation of 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent 457 being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers saying it might offend Australian neighbors.
“Loud statements “foreigners at the end of the queue” and “work first for the Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant from the time the unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said today for the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white labor force should have been protected – and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region had noticed an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he was dealing with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes, and the rest remain to be considered.
If the ‘authorities’ criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or a personal connection with the owner or a relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.’
Following previous experience with enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35 - year - old man from Sri Lanka, seeking asylum, died suspiciously of a heart attack after arriving this week on a shelter ship to the Christmas Islands.
A man’s nine - year - old frightened son traveled to Australia along with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat.
The Australian authorities and the man rushed to the hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Baroness Kramer, Minister of Transport, said that the project "will bring the UK together".
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" by working with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After completing Phase Two, the line from Manchester to Leeds will lead.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that better connects Great Britain and its cities.”
We've given SH2 the green light because the benefits that it will bring are huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a connection – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across Great Britain.
Scottish minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "clearly" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed line has the potential to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of the high-speed railway across Britain.”
So we are enthusiastically working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bring benefits to everyone and supplement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British ministers over the next year and making joint decisions on the next steps.
Together with Bárta, the Anti-corruption Police Analyst arrested the inspection
Information on the arrest of Vít Barta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the report was delivered by server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF TODAY soon discovered that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS), her people were to arrest Bartha in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
Inspections shall address cases where police officers are involved, but their jurisdiction shall also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - Jan Petržílek, head of analysts and informatics, is among the arrested.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
Jaroslav Ibehej, spokesperson for anti-corruption police, refused to comment on the fact that the media had to address GIBS in this matter.
But Radka Sandorová also referred to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prosecutor's Office.
It can also be deduced from this vague reaction that the event has taken place, but it is under a regime of secrecy that does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even in this matter", but since it's classified information, he can't confirm or disprove Bart's arrest.
At first, some media speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted by Bart together with former Chairman VV Radek John, who was in charge of the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute, which because of this burned down between the exemier Petr Nečas and VV, even then President Václav Klaus had to deal with.
I don't know where that connection came from.
No one has contacted me, I have not been questioned.
"I really don't know anything about the matter," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, a real party leader, but he was Barta at the time.
Barta was now running for election for the Dawn movement, and he missed the parliamentary mandate just by 175 votes.
Dawn Leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Barta was one of many candidates of many parties on our candidate and, as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who said before the elections that he gave Bart space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executors.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will still have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during start-up and landing, regardless of changes in the US in order to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given American companies room to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in “air” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are bothered that they cannot access their electronic books during the start and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it has examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic equipment in an aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, who had already talked to CASA about extending the use of its on-board Wi-Fi entertainment system, was inclined to change, but announced that it would submit to the regulatory authority’s decision.
"We would welcome CASA's analysis of permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that it would improve customer experience now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment)." said the spokesperson.
Qantas has announced that it will adhere to current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it anytime soon," he said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that may be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly study thoroughly the FAA decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference with mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training material, hand luggage programs and information for passengers.
"Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew shall order the passengers to turn off the device during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the storage area above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings in a pawn shop at the Bendemeer shopping cent in Singapore to pay her daughter's tuition fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it," says Mrs.Amirthalinga.
Although every month as administrator she receives $2,400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is such that the ValueMax company, where a woman carries out her transaction, has become the third pawnshop on the Singapore Stock Exchange on the charts this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to lend cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs.Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income and can provide a loan faster than banks.
That is why millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops, with families feeling pressure because of rising life costs and rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families are turning to pawn shops to deal with a deteriorating financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's quoted the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia due to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the 80 percent GDP ranking, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with increasing costs, people from medium to low [income scale] will try to replenish their income wherever they can," said Song Song Wun, economist at CIMB Bank of Malaysia.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people’s haste to stop their personal property and take advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewels for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
The growth in the pawn shop sector is so large that ValueMax, an operator of a branch in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says the Executive Director of ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it acquired this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors are under fire for criticism of high interest rates, Mrs Yeah says that the pledge offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers stop objects they already own, and monetizing personal property does not increase the household debt," he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, those who use pawnshops are not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and they can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible proportions.
"They belong to wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term for their brave business or investments, or small businesses that need help to solve their cash flow problems," says Mrs.
Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for dying health care in Tasmania contains harsh conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is making "rapid measures" to ward off the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, the higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government came up with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract operations, will help to eliminate indebtedness.
The money is also available at the Hobart and Launceston clinics, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic systems of health records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to ideas that the leading clinical doctors told me would help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Union of Australia and inform each month where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will be useless “until a real reform is followed in order to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
Yet he commended the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first made in negotiations with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I believe that the federal aid package can get public health care out of critical condition," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
A spokesman for the federal opposition in the field of health care, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is just a "plasty".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our medical system," he said to ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes away nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that devotes $300 million, and pretends it's good news.
Mr Dutton has called on Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicoloux has adapted the novel Denise Diderota, which brings an exceptional film expedition and the portrayal of the time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 1860s in France and tells a gloomy story about Suzanne, a young noble woman sent by her family to a monastery.
When she revolts, she experiences extremely cruel treatment from the criminally perverted mother superior and for others she becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lewdness or sensationalism, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads to a torment similar to that of wearing a horse’s shirt.
Ski resorts want to make families with children cheaper
Syria destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, said on Thursday the Committee for Global Chemical Weapons Supervision, while violent conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the locations where toxic substances are expected to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced the day before November 1st,
the date set by the Hague-based organisation for the destruction or disabling of the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery production facilities for the mixing of chemicals for the purpose of producing toxic gas and ammunition.
Completion of this basically initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as soon as Thursday’s battles in Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and storage sites, were raging, said the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Britain.
A group of activists, through a network of activists in Syria, monitored the total number of victims, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
That's supposed to be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29 954 members of Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18 678 pro-government fighters and 187 armed men from Hezbollah, Lebanon.
There are also 2,202 government defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations Organization estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops fought against the insurgents in Sapira, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observation room stated on Thursday that the losses were on both sides but did not have specific numbers.
Fighting has highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in their mission to rid Syria of chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from OPCW, which closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that his team was now “satisfying to verify – and monitor the destruction – of Syrian declared essential equipment for manufacturing and mixing/filling.”
He added that "no other control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said that they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of safety concerns, they were unable to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two sites, according to Syria, were “abandoned and ... the chemical weapons programme items it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked”.
It was not immediately clear whether the equipment in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I bow to the courage and bravery you showed in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had," said the observer director of Ahmet Uzumcu in his comments issued by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad’s government, with their security forces, full of members of the Alawite sect, stand against each other in the civil war, the branch of Shia Islam.
In terms of further developments, the head of the Watcher's Rami Abdul Rahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict handed down over the mastermind of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of 202 persons killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 responded angryly to the sentence of the last of the plotters who were brought to justice and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people remained dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other counts related to terrorism, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it could insist that a man nicknamed "Demolition Man" be sentenced to death because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived June Corteen’s painful memories, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old Jane and Jenny twins in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other plotters nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Mrs. Corteen said: "He should be put in front of a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I won't see any more grandchildren and daughters.
Club Sari was levelled to the ground when a heavy charge was detonated shortly after 23 p.m. in an outdoor parked van on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and as he was kept alive, he died to the doctors three times.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamiya responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like nobody else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive is.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, not so much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He avoided arrest for almost ten years, but was eventually caught in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where less than four months later, US forces killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender voluntarily," said Mrs Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can still appeal to the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological gains on aircraft (but they must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – apart from calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies, and listen to music on Thursday’s eagerly anticipated new rules issued by the FAA.
Passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to each airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at the press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to FAA administration how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and device storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the extended use of electronic equipment very quickly," the FAA stated in its statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches 3 kilometers and the captain gives the permit.
Passengers are expected to shut down their devices again when the plane falls to land and turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and taxiing, said the FAA.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitude are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stevards, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
Frankly, we're tired of looking like "watchmen."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometers of altitude, said the agency.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So there is still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when, as is well known, he was fired from an American Airlines aircraft because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored for fear that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the American Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, an expert on national transport security at CBS News, said that cell phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference with transmitter towers in the air," Rosenker said.
In order to investigate this problem, the FAA Advisory Committee proposed last month that the government allow the wider use of electronic equipment.
In recent years, the FAA has been under pressure to alleviate restrictions on its use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, say there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers also forget the obligation to shut down or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radios, technical gains of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also constructed, and approved by FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to the new rules for the greater use of electronic equipment, says Huert.
Current electronic equipment generally emits much less intense radio transmission than was the case with previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimal transmissions when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when devices download or transmit data.
Amazon.com is among those who are pushing for the release of restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the transport aircraft with their electronic Kindle readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passengers Association said that he believes that interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only fragmented reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off equipment during instrument flight in low visibility.
The group of the travel industry welcomed these changes, and according to it this is a sensible procedure for the travelling public, which uses technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One of the rattlesnakes was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after previously being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue center until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: “This rattler probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught him over the North Sea. ”
Apparently, he ran out of power and found his refuge on the oil rig.
Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help. ”
He was in good condition and well health at the time of the asphyxiation.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to join businesses and define the changes that British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in relation to the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government favours new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than get caught up in a long and strenuous process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopolistic regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of a European business area – even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, expressed their approval.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
It follows from the findings with which undertakings of different sizes and major business groups have identified themselves that the business sector is pushing for a “sense change” that will shift its influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% in the referendum vote for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports its plan to amend the conditions of British membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and, given the way the eurozone is embarking on a journey for a narrower economic and fiscal union, it is becoming increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, this means a refocus on business and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry confessed: spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone too far in spying, according to AFP, the head of American diplomacy John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, however, the gathering of information served to ward off terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington", according to AFP, was heard in the midst of a heated controversy on both sides of the Atlantic due to scandalous data-surveillance revelations by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which also targeted American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these events have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended the practice so far.
According to him, gathering information is essential for combating terrorism and preventing assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, the assassinations of Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to be informed of the plots in time," Kerry emphasized.
However, he admitted once again that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The affair around American intelligence, which allegedly watched hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that Americans were also tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
European leaders did not hide indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to prevent or significantly limit monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction started on the Bulgarian South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, say officials.
Miller says that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “for all time” eliminated.
As soon as the whole project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that construction is to start at the end of this year in other countries.
The gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to the ever-clarifying reports, Israel destroyed Hezbollah’s missiles during Wednesday’s raids on two locations in Western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its programme is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it will prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah’s hands in Lebanon.
News of Wednesday’s Israeli raids on weapons warehouses in Western Syria has yet to be specified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by US sources.
According to Syria's Dampress.com website, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakiya.
Al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses were hit, in which the missiles were ready for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, the missiles were Russian-made SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron Ben Jesse said that Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles, and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah to handle missiles.
The SA-8 are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, mobility and small proportions make it easy to hide.
They're equipped with radar, but it shuts down after firing the missile, so it's hard to track them.
Latakiya lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by ruling alavories.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has participated in the fights in Western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community to which the allavité belongs.
Now, apparently, 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help take back the army, Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle is to be retaliated according to the source of al-Arabija for the recent attack of the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to win back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many insurgents from Kusajr have just left for Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, spending money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals have been cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens suit this situation.
That they didn't really mind and were actually satisfied with the state that was there (the theft and debt of this state).
Otherwise I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not come to the elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS in total 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1,016,829 ČSSD voters to the above parties, then with the old order (because all of them participated in the "stealing" and indebtedness of this state), 64.23% of rightful voters actually agreed to this situation.
In fact, most voters have shown that they are not in favour of punishing the perpetrators of this state's theft and over-debt.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD, who participated in this, are going to enforce appropriate laws?
Is there any way we can be helped?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) were charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Children’s Sexual Abuse Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with child abuse before being charged with child - rearing charges against Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011.
But before the commission, it was said that in its opening statement to the commission, the association stated that they had never dealt with the case of sexual abuse of the child in their organization.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where one of YMCA’s employees was accused of child pornography offences, and another, when the gym teacher in Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted of sexual harassment of children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the board's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
It admitted that the YMCA’s initial statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which appreciated the organisation as a leading advocate of children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission indicates that YMCA has been notified that it received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society of August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership itself from him downwards failed when he accepted Mr. Lord without making sure that the personnel were aware of the obligation to report breaches of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually harassing 12 boys he committed during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He's been incarcerated for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting a child safety breach by Mr. Lord.
Staff members gave evidence that they witnessed such violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, watching them privately, leaving them sitting on his lap, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord’s subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the YMCA children’s services in Caringbah, who was Lord’s superior, was “very intimidating and often difficult to discuss with him.”
The Director General said that he did not accept the staff's evidence, that they felt uncomfortable if they were to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord clouded their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said that he told the YMCA Council in New South Wales that the lesson of the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organization was that the staff "did not report", and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were filed was made by YMCA's child service manager Liam Whitley.
He said that the goal was to avoid disruption of evidence, but it was “excessively zealous” and misdemeanor.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, vetting, incorporating, training and managing personnel.
The hearing was adjourned on December 20.
Tony Blair said he'd take a chance to return to the post of prime minister, but he admitted that coming back is unlikely.
In a late-night interview on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, 59-year-old politicians expressed their views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned as leader, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador to the Bizkado peace quartet.
When he was asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, his reply to the London Evening Standard quoted as follows: “Yes, of course, but it’s probably hard to come to that, so..."
While a crowd of horse-showing experts were gathering in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he hasn't gone to school yet and only a few months ago he took his first steps, this little boy and his pet, Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly trotted through three laps to finally win the main prize and left behind 30 towing adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – at the same height – was commended at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff for appearance, behaviour and style.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret into a cheerful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee stroll around the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given his third birthday in March and has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony ever since.
His mother Donna (30) said: “Fenton and Toffee work together well. ”
They did not get their hopes up, but eventually they left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and completely foreign people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of her aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing off horses for more than 10 years.
“ There was an exciting atmosphere, ” says Mrs. Howells, “and everyone cheered and applauded. ”
He ran across the sand all along the length of the arena and even though he worked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm and he got two chickens in charge.
Given how he started, he'll be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon, and I'm sure he'll do just fine.
A spokesman for the annual horse show show showoff said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony. ”
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the pony and the leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped him. He really did fit in with him.
Too inquisitive a newspaper to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which, on the front page, requested the release of a reporter accused of slander, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
The newspaper New Express, based in Guangzhou, has made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a society partially owned by the state.
The warden said that the New Express newspaper will now make a full correction.
The regulation on "repair" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013 the New Express newspaper of the Yongcheng Group Evening News has published several false reports on this company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," he said in his statement.
He said that he had to decide "to impose administrative punishment on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a cancellation of the journalistic license".
He also “ordered the Yankee Evening News group to make a full correction of the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the New Express management.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express concerning financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed to be behind his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on state television and admitted to giving false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I caused damage to Zoomlion, as well as to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he said at the state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I've done wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued an apology on the front page, stating that he failed when he failed to check his reports.
Recently, the confession has made several closely monitored suspects on TV.
Experts say that confessions are still being enforced regularly, regardless of the amendment to this year's law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel was found to smuggle drugs between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad.
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel of about one by one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever discovered.
A tunnel that clicks into nearly six football fields connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses, where trucks can easily be hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before the drugs could be undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also intercepted eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of convictions, they face prison sentences from 10 to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate large-scale drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which puts a problem before drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres in length equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and the Centre connect management.
They offer, for example, a common advertisement
Economia's new integrated newsroom in Prague Karlín.
Economia took the next step to transform Centrum holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and Centrum have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," commented the changes made by the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Economics and appointed CEO Kamil Čermák.
The Èermák, who will lead the single management, will be supplemented by the Executive Director of the Holdings Centre Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new joint director of the store, to whom the advertiser director of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová is subordinate.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
Vladimír Piskáček is the joint director of editorials, whose team also includes Jakub Unger, the Director for Transformation.
Adéla Pitts was entrusted with the newly established position of marketing director.
Věra Lhotská newly manages a separate branch of corporate communication.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will allow us, among other things, to enter the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the production of content of all issued titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuálně.cz, žená.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of nearly twenty other smaller websites.
Economia is a publisher of Hospodářské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly Respekt and Economia and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among the Czech publishers it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to a newly built modern space in Prague's Karlín.
CME will target the TV business.
They'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be fired.
By the end of the year, he wants to shrink by a thousand people.
He's going to cut off all the collateral, and he just wants to focus on his major business, the TV show.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4 500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates televisions in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licences for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech versions of MTV.
How much savings will touch the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the Czech TV number one TV Nova is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really can't comment," said Nova communication director Josef Koukolíček.
According to the information of MF DNES, significant redundancies of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both the new bosses of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined after longtime director Adrian Sarbu during a Wednesday conference call with analysts, spoke about their desire to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of production of its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
The cooling tower burned down in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague at night
In the industrial complex ČKD in Prague, a large-capacity reservoir burned, according to firefighters probably a cooling tower.
"Firemen started the fire on Thursday before 11:00 p.m., and they finished catching up on the fire this morning," said Pavlína Adamcová, spokesperson for Prague firemen.
The amount of pollutants in the ambient air, according to measurements, did not exceed the permitted limits.
The level of damage and the causes of the fire are still unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire from a large storage tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamcová said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the premises, so we are extinguishing by means of a transport line from tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing of the poorly functioning hydrant network complicated, so the fire department had to transport the water from elsewhere.
Fire Chief's called in a second-degree fire alarm.
There are four levels in total, the fourth is announced in the most serious situations.
The chemists set off to check the level of hazardous substances that could have been airborne during the fire.
"However, they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed the hygiene standards," said the fireman's spokesperson.
The British police have delivered an extradition notice to Assange.
Today, the British police delivered an extradition notice to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that he delivered a "notice of extradition" to a 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to the police station and that if he doesn't do so, he might be threatened with arrest.
Assange under British law exhausted his options when the Supreme Court lifted his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden due to sexual crimes charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would give him up to the US, he sought refuge on June 19 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in this South American country.
Scotland Yard “produced an extradition notice to a 40 - year - old man asking him to come to the police station on the day and hour that he was assigned to,” said the spokesman.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange is afraid of being extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to £110 miles an hour with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a cup of drinks between his thighs.
At the Colchester Howie Police Court, he confessed to the charge that he was driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie has also been ordered to pay the cost of £90 and a premium for the accused of £100.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble is bursting.
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the income tax on financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborn, who presented in the 2012 budget a fee of 7% for the transfer of real estate for buildings over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the real estate transfer charge in the housing fund in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “It is very difficult to argue that high value property is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the obsolete tax system, given the increase in the transfer of real estate to high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is undertaxed."
He added that “this step may have caused some foreign investors to hesitate to buy property in London, or that existing owners are reluctant to sell.”
The front real estate – between 5% and 10% of the housing market by price – in a rich belt dating from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded a record increase of 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London continued to grow by 5.6% year after year, but were overshadowed by a booming “home market,” in which according to a survey by the real estate agency Savills experienced Southwest, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) increments.
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Earlier research showed that happy dogs wiggle their tail more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs wave their tail mainly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movements.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “People are well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that give rise to positive or negative emotions. ”
We tried to observe the same thing with other species.
He added that, as with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs react to the asymmetric tails of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and another.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs films about dogs – whether in a natural version or in a silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and show it more to the right or left."
When the animals saw an otherwise bland dog moving his tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging his tail), she remained perfectly calm.
But when she recorded tail filming mostly to the left (again from the dog’s view of the wagging tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he doesn't think dogs communicate consciously with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what moves they must and may not be careful about.
He said: “If you encounter dogs several times and their tail movement in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and traffic movement breeds less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers understand the emotions of their animals better.
Dog Behavior Specialist John Bradshaw, a university veterinary teacher at Bristol University, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right parties were important to dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and on the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another technical treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “Doggy robot was more likely to be familiar with dogs when they were wagging their tail left than right, when they were becoming more uncertain – quite the opposite of an Italian study.”
According to him, the difference can be due to the fact that dogs in these different studies did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots entirely as dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs react to real dogs might help.
"Although there are strong evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it may not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and another to the other.
Arctic Monkeys because of Alex Turner's illness moved the gig in Glasgow
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved the gig in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
But Alex Turner's lead singer's illness forced her to move the performance.
The group’s announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday’s performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s performance in the LG arena in Birmingham and on the basis of medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys Group must postpone the performance at the Hydro in Glasgow complex scheduled for Friday, November 1.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to perform."
The gig in the LG arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th and the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21st.
All tickets to these performances remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to all those who bought tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis on February 22 was first appointed by the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope, and they are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will eventually help to select his successors.
There are now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the Pope’s election – a group thus shrinking to 120 elected cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the promotion of new cardinals, there would be a gathering of current cardinals known as the Consistory.
"The Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals is likely to fall by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a certain focus on Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose task was to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope made all his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was quite possible that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before – it is completely new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he’s naming.”
GM withdraws some new light trucks in the USA to repair seat backs
According to Friday's announcement from the US Motor Safety Authority, General Motors withdraws nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to repair the malfunction with manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may be defective.
As a result, seat backs are not in accordance with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
The announcement placed on the website of the National Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) states that “if the car gets hit from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the passenger, increasing the risk of injury”.
The downloaded models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
GM launched the delivery in June, and for this leading American car company, it is the most important placing of vehicles on the market from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the delivery of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcement to owners due to the 16-day malfunction of the government, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra’s sales, which were revised for models in 2014, increased to around 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, declared GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to USD 37.47.
Obama’s Voter’s Desperate Scream
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have thwarted the obstruction of the Republican Party.
Obstructive policy cannot justify the hardship of Obama’s health care website or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would cheer me up and restore a little hope during the gloomy days of my second year in medical school.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and took your breath away.
Elections ended with overwhelming dominance, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents kept the newspaper they got.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
Obama had 82 percent support during his entry into office in 2008.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
There have been real changes in the years after I threw in my first ballot.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the law on affordable care through the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “not to ask, not to say anything” after the death of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, public choice of health care and closure of the base in Guantanamo.
But after many situations when I defended the Obama administration from my colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The obstructions of Republicans cannot explain their consent to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or to drones that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it pursues those who expose the wrong actions of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process, or for reducing public contributions and expenses during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... of Nixon's administration".
And most recently, they cannot excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if you could expect something like that.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the elected function is not predictable, and our public talks will be shaped by opposition political parties and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have set above seem to a large extent to be the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and uncut alternative, and he seemed unable to consolidate his politics or position.
I felt that the second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we had once heard of.
Yet the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
Makes me remember that line of promises that disappeared.
This week, I read a chapter in the book on how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton in the Primaries in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign he told his staff that he had to get back to his pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are exclusively Nathaniel Morris's views.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program.
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mine tycoon, who disputes over the payment of $6 million worth of coal tax assets, made this statement as he tried to get rid of the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer’s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate that play a vital role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
"He was in a big conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave, because if either of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election of the Election Commission, Mr. Palmer was officially declared a winner in the battle for the Fairfax District in the Sunshine Coast area by winning 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget's daughters.
Should these elections be decided two months after the polls are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come up with details on the computer, vote immediately, and get results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, you can erase the results if someone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Election Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political program also covers Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job “very seriously”.
The public office is a public service.
"We seek no reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
You're washing your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands will change your mind.
98 people participated in the experiment, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an unsolvable task.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failure seemed much more optimistic than the group where they did not wash their hands.
Also, the "washed hands" group did better in the next test than the other.
Yet those who washed their hands got worse results in other tests than those who did not.
The results of the "maturated" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the test results indicate that physical cleanliness removes truly negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, but the tests need to concentrate much more in the next test.
If we were to transfer the research results to the Czechs, we would probably be most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but on the way by public transport it is already one fifth.
Most of the time, after working in the garden or in the workshop, 85 percent of people wash their hands in hygiene.
The pet caressing motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, to what extent it is necessary to wash your hands after a handshake to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I am afraid that reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," commented skin doctor Klaudia Komárková on the results of the survey.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that global investigations by the supervisory authorities regarding suspicious currency-market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with competent authorities in investigations into the largest financial market in the world, where they change owners of USD 5.3 trillion each day.
The two traders mentioned would be the first RBS employees suspended in the framework of an expanding investigation, which will respond to the LIBOR scandal (London interbank interest rate).
The bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our ongoing search continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event said that RBS had handed over records of e-mails and quick messages sent from accounts and accounts of a former trader to the British financial behavior authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Chairman of Cash Trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former Head of Currency Trading in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Neither of these traders has been charged with any offence.
Mr Usher's rapid news group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said the people in the event.
This week, UBS stated that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss supervisory authority had notified Finma that it had investigated suspicious machinations in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office – are investigating the claim that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse initiated internal investigations or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks comb through years of fast news and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that was one of the largest profit-making engines in investment banks’ closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation when they claimed that a large and highly liquid foreign currency market is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this is not necessarily true.
A high-ranking trader said that, despite the considerable volume of day-to-day trading in foreign currency, liquidity fragmentation between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, means that “you can start having an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released a trader from its share trading department this week, which had caused a loss of nearly USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have registered over a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the monitoring in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is based on the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS at the State Health Institute.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infected throughout the Czech Republic.
Immunity failure disease has already started in 396.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased every year in the last decade.
In 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009 the examination revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010 180.
Last year, however, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, in my opinion there is no doubt," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavý, who has been running the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed infection in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavtý.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1710 males and 353 females.
AIDS disease erupted in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Who really wants to meet a city, should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the cunnilingus center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the box would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves".
The cemeteries wander slowly and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what faiths they are, how large and cohesive families they belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social position, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how they care about their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama’s Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in compliance with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
With a vote of 5:4, the court decided that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they are at risk of paying a fine – does not contradict the constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
Chairman John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court of First Instance also supported the remainder of the Law on 2700 pages and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which requires States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise all financing of sickness insurance from federal sources is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises brought action to block this law.
During the 2012 primarys, each of the main Republican candidates, including the presumed candidate Mitt Romney, strongly rejected the law.
For the words "Mugabe is a limping donkey" there is no longer a prison, the court has abolished the law
Until now, Zimbabweans had to be careful how they spoke in public about the 89 - year - old Mugab who has ruled the country since the early 1980 ’ s, and since the end of 1987 he has been in charge of it.
According to paragraph 33 of the Penal Code, a fine of up to a year in prison was threatened for disrespecting the presidency.
"State representatives should not be eager to blame people who comment on the President in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines the freedom of expression.
It's likely the government will appeal the court's ruling, inform the British BBC.
The law was loudly defined by a number of damaged Zimbabweans, including Tendai Dang, who were arrested by the police two years ago for alleged insult to the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist in public, Mugabe, ended up in prison, saying "the limp ass."
In August, the prosecutor then accused a 26 - year - old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.
The court also declared the unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove false," said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who discloses false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing criminalization for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to express itself freely," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has been ruling a country with hard hands for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
She took small steps away from the dictatorship of one man of the country in 2009, when the agreement between Mugab and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the Prime Minister's seat.
Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008, the world’s highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only currencies of other countries are paid in Zimbabwe.
The impoverished economy is at the root of Mugabe's indiscreet agricultural reform.
In 2000 he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience in running the farm.
Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to enable banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It is a very sensible move," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economist of the Bank of London, Barclays.
"So far all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is no surprise to me," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the ties that began in 2007, when the international credit market first stalled.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies for anyone who needed them.
Central bankers’ decisions come at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its support program for the US economy, which could drive the price of money on the global market even higher.
A swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency is at the same time.
It can be understood as a repository of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered at Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish it, because someone who couldn't finish registering from the Internet was sitting at the branch office.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and that changed my address and my ID number.
When I wanted to finish registering later, I was told that I couldn't do it, because I have a different OP number, an address and that I just can't finish it and that I should apply for data deletion and make a new registration.
That is what I did and I wrote on technical support on 24.10.2013 that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
That's what the technical support said I should finish my registration at the branch.
Thus began the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where finally after 4th Urgance 25.10. they wrote that the personal data at my request had been erased.
So you would think that you could do the new registration and here started the problems again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it has not been deleted - it is not personal information, but eventually they also disabled this).
So I used a different user name and it came to my attention that my personal data was already stored to complete registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that claims they deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
On my question, how is it possible to write back that personal data has actually been deleted on 25.10. and to send an e-mail with the error.
That's what I did (about 15 o'clock yesterday) and I got a letter today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why I can't do it, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What is the matter with the fact that I have been contacting technical support for a week and dealing with them that I still can't?
What does it matter that if the truth is what they claim (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way, at 13.22 I actually registered, in the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number and world wonder, a page appeared to me that they sent me a link to the email to complete the registration.
But how is that possible if you cannot register in the same name and date of birth?
I guess it's because Tipsport ties the registration to an e-mail and the phone number, and he just didn't disable the data as he claims.
So again, I told this technical support that they were simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they were writing), because what they were writing was not true.
I've documented several screens that the registration problem was before 31.10. so "false" registration simply doesn't affect this.
I'm sorry, but by registering you, we can't verify your claim.
And he shut down the comms.
Respectfully, he repeats the same sentence over and over again that registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and so did not actually happen.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only didn't erase the data he claims, but he's still lying when he says otherwise.
Even worse, it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the error is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little bit in motion and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was handed over for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and warning of the same mistake).
Music plays in the metro on the Bridge
The Prague Transport Company launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where recorded instrumental music plays continuously during underground operation, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Author Michal Horáček brought not only his completely new two-CD Czech Calendar to the Hall of the Municipal House of Cologne, but mainly in the programme Between us singers Lenka Novo, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Matěj Benk.
After the opening intro and the acting etude about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded a story about the last time they played in Cologne and the theatre and the whole city went out of power.
"Otherwise, in Cologne, two types of cards were produced, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also reminded me of President Zeman's native.
"Maybe we could tour Zákolany or Dúvravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the clock, but he had no idea about ice hockey at the time, how we met in those squares and chanting, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That is also the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we will not play it here today," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this album for him a very suitable sleep in the day, sing at night and accompany himself to the guitar.
Otherwise, unless he sang, played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a bit of a push Up the hill of the heart sits down, which immediately turned the auditorium on.
"I am glad you were intrigued by the song, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," responded Michal Horáček.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, it was recognizable in the performance of František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded by a huge applause, Hana Hegerová reminded her of the song Dad liked Lída Baarová and with Horace's explanation about the communist ban and the replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the composition Sebastián, Segrado sang a beautiful composition Prague by Jarda Svoboda, Zásmucký native and former Kolíňák.
But that was the end, standing ovation and an addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
There was one more encore on the playlist, but the fans didn't clap.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole quarter sat at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with any interested parties she took a photo.
Berdycha and Štěpánek will complement Rosol and Hájek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia was nominated by the non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav Navrátil four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they are going to play on the field of the opponent to the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15th to 17th November.
The Czechs have been in the finals for the third time in five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we have to focus on our performance as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to score three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the creator of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria is supposed to look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats, and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target and came back.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire operation and are no longer expressing themselves.
The exact opposite of confused and big-mouthed, acts unsupported by Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be fooled by the media by their claims that the "Syrian base" or "deliveries for Hezbalah" have been bombed.
I recently wrote about the fact that while helping the US secular insurgents in the country remains on a rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply Syria's weapons.
And it was a fresh supply of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakija that became the target of an Israeli air raid.
It's a clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed Assad's regime, not the rebels, although according to popular Internet theories it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has decorated two members of the special forces, probably the Delta Force.
Until now, they had no idea that they were decorated during the attack on the US consulate in Bengazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city is known to me as members of a secret CIA commando, which is made up of former soldiers.
There's been a lot of speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at a CIA residence elsewhere.
It's clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has protected its offices with machine-gun nests in Libya (on one such, both SEALs died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of an American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received reports of an attack in Bengazi, they volunteered to intervene, and along with five private contractors, they shot their way to the CIA compound in Bengazi.
Obama’s administration is baffled by the fact that during the attack, the commando was not officially deployed and the whole thing and that it was simply hesitant to do.
Commandant, so without orders, they'll probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that he's working in the country not just one-off, but permanent American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And that, given that until recently, nothing has officially confessed to such a thing, and even now it is only a NATO advisory mission in Libya that is being discussed.
But it is a good thing that the US is trying half-assed to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although it would take much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost sang Iranian air force for prosecuting U.S. drones.
But little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that Iran's F-4 Phantom plane was chasing an American drone in international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He fell under Phantoma to optically verify his armor without Phantom registering it on radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared with him and challenged the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without murmuring.
It's no wonder that Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but he remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful in the last few days, defenseman or midfielder Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral is in the form that brought him back to the team after a year.
He also succeeds in shooting women, debauchery, after the procedure he was given a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached out in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end she took one point from these two duels.
Francis Rajtoral believes that his team will break the unpleasant series in a match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the North Koreans who play offensive football.
Everything goes towards the game with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video game analysis of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," attracts Czech fans to the Doosan Arena stands.
The last matches did not work out the way she wanted, but the word of the crisis is rejected by defenseman Victoria.
That's how football works, sometimes you're in good shape, and sometimes worse.
But there's no way I'd be talking about a crisis.
"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," means Western defender.
The Victoria team will once again rely on support from fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans, who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
- Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, it's a big leap - a jump a few years back, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and wash dishes, vacuum and do homework.
Although these "obligations" were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running from school, throwing the bag in a corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump a shot.
Then during the series Helena and her boys embroider a ceremonial tablecloth with chain stitch for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings finally wash the dishes, vacuum, in winter carry wood into tiled stoves and do tasks after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of writing love verses addressed to school love).
To eat homemade strawberry jam in the morning (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, whose contents were not even laid next to strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mother and I liked to collect so much.
I also remember those magical nights where the silence of the grave was in the room when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio to the tapes that were shooting loudly in the old tape recorder of my mom.
And then we rewinded the tapes on our pencils and played the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and they toasted it with a siphon.
Or we were on the phone over the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were on the phone to hear ourselves better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, then the cleaner was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live with it so that nothing was missing.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
The clothes were passed down from generation to generation and the best "thread" in the closet was a batified homemade T-shirt with the help of SAVA.
From electronics we were satisfied with the mentioned mom's tape recorder and at most Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we only used on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said, "just" go out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure my parents saved it for a long time, but unfortunately it wasn't warmed up for a long time.
My little sister shoved a strudel into him, said he was eating those tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if he could eat a strudel.
Unfortunately, he did, but it was his last bite.
Well, she still has that story, poor thing, on her dad's plate.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put a strudel in a video and thought that she would play the recipe and not play it, which is why she still can't bake it.
I remember how we could all communicate, communicate without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I agreed on holidays with my grandmother's granddaughter, when we will meet again next summer at Grandma's - and so it was, so it was.
We met.
Do you promise to see someone next year?!
I also remember the winter when we were running around with the whole village, building snowmen, riding a snowy hill near the church on bags of stuffed hay.
Then we had dinner together with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear that notorious phrase before every dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have any soap tied to the tap in your lemon net.
After dinner, when my dad worked in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, leaned our feet against the tiled stove, opened the door and watched the flame and listened to the crackling of wood pouring from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through various chats, text messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I complete these memories by looking at albums that are neatly glued to black horns by black and white photos.
And in case I don't know how old I was back then, pictures are always written a year of taking a picture.
I see that even though the cuts according to the pot didn't suit us and we had our cousin's pants two times bigger, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back that step forward - into reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting to see what the modern times will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me for a young teenage generation are at least "hundred years behind monkeys" now, and I think they're missing out a lot, that they won't be able to experience this "pre-ape" time either.
I wish they could!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
On Thursday, a group that owns thousands of patents for the disappearance of Nortel filed a patent infringement suit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that was relicited during the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which purchased Nortel’s USD 4.5 billion patents, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies at the US District Court in Texas for patent violations.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps link Internet search terms with the advertising, and it mentions the lawsuit, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reach.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on Google Android's operating system that strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting bid of USD 900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to 4.4 billion USD.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel patents, Google won Motorola Mobility for USD 12.5 billion, which was partly motivated by a group of Motorola patents.
"Despite the failure to obtain in the auction patents which are the subject of the dispute, Google violated and continued to violate the patents," the complaint states.
Rockstar seeks increased compensation from Google because it claims that Google intentionally infringes the patent, as claimed by the prosecution.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came from outside, from 4 degrees Fahrenheit, which we're not used to yet.
First, she put off her smile, the one that kept showing off as a defense against the wannabe friendly surroundings.
She was so relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was only honest at home on the days when she was grandmother and had her grandchildren Elinka or Adiek around.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered very well the lesson from endless courses in business skills.
Now they're finally really useful.
So she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a masquerade costume.
November, or another month, can't do that miracle to make her smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt puts the first freely elected president in office
Muhammad Morsi took an inauguration oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised “new Egypt” when he was solemnly put into office as the first freely elected president of that country, after Husni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
On his entry into office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black gowns in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and the other Republic," Morsi said at the ceremony broadcast live on national television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most 84 years since it was founded as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small motorcade shortly after 11 p.m., hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak’s period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the motorcade could pass through the usually busy route connecting the city centre with the suburbs in the south.
Morsi's personal prestige, mockingly referred to as the non-charismatic "reservative tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also to all those who want to bring an end to the revolt against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said in a blue social suit with a red tie to a wooden chamber judge, where he took an oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to give an inauguration speech.
While standing at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
Military commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chanting of the “armies and the people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the University.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a bastion of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a revolution was born last year that ended Mubarak's authoritarian government, and he solemnly promised to take back the presidential powers taken away from his office by the military council, which took them over from the banished leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before a court, rather than before a parliament, as is customary, he has yielded to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll probably be police specialists in the ghettos to ease the tension.
Police specialists should work in ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from slums and local residents.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior is counting on this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would be mainly "accelerated security of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 slums and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, especially Romani people.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families depended on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It was usury.
According to the experts of the problem localities, it has increased by a hundred.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are intensifying.
In several places, anti-Romani marches took place.
Extremists were also joined by people in the area.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
It is said that the 'continuous application of equal access to law enforcement' is a fundamental condition.
However, it is said that this cannot be achieved without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he'd keep an eye on order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
"Thanks to established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of infringements," the insider said.
Specialists in ghettos would get extras, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into troubled areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (about CZK 15,5 million now).
The Czech Republic pays 15% of the sum, 85% of the funds.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors reported.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the design of the project, the selected police officers first completed an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should pass this training each year.
They'll make the most suitable candidates.
There should also be a special education for police officers who will operate in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It is said to motivate and lead to integration.
According to interior ideas, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be to meet the hostel with specific rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to comply with an integration plan that social workers would have drawn up with them.
They would have to follow the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would advance to a higher standard of housing.
The permeable housing system should work for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation grows "in a pro-integration-motivated environment".
The social housing model is prepared by local development and work departments.
They're supposed to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were here at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, on the top of the Uhlířské vrch is a striking white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church was not preserved.
Shortly after the completion of the church was planted an alley from four rows of lip, about 1 km long.
The cross road on Uhlířské vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 lasted only until 2004.
On 15 stops there are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver František Nedemlel.
He used various species of wood from the area of Low Jeseník.
Similarly, the bases from the rocks in the area form an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop includes the name of the sponsor.
The coal hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from the radiometric measurements of age vary somewhat, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is thus younger than the Great Roudný (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venus’s volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
In it, she threw out a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the subsoil, which by burning got a reddish - brown color.
At the end of this phase the lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption ejected red, brown and red and black tufs in places.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the quarry wall.
In the tubes there are noticeable volcanic bombs up to 1 meter long. The second eruption was ended by lava discharge.
At the end of the activity from the volcano flowed lava, which today makes up to 50 m a powerful layer of slag basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate the discharge of volcanic ash with lava discharges are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name stratovulkans.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subject to erosion.
However, he was threatened by mining rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tufy was added to concrete, which was lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under pressure from both experts and the public, mining managed to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and small cohesion of rocks, which are rapidly weathering, falling apart and sliding down the slope.
The quarry disappears quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach the Uhlířský Hill on the green tourist trail from Bruntál or Slezský Kočov.
Automakers can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the lime alley, where the short educational trail begins.
From the villa, she moved to the building.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment house with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas on Ořechovce.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance package.
Ivana quickly sought replacement housing for herself and her then older mother.
From her friends she got a tip on apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first, it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the large forest park and the dam excited me on the other hand," Ivana recalls the first impression.
At first, I thought it'd be a makeshift for, like, three years.
"Today we have lived here for more than 13 years and not only for a gradual reconstruction, I would not change it," the owner adds.
Mother and daughter then moved from a 120-meter apartment to a smaller flat with a surface of 62 m2 and distributed almost all equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting doors or changing windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most bothered by an impractical and unnecessarily large hall, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used plasterboard to define individual zones and break down the drywall room, which enabled the new location of the lights.
The first intervention she decided to make after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the apartment layout to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improve the standard was replacing PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn't know what to do with the bathroom.
For years, I took magazines about living and looked for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On the recommendation, I contacted young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the available hall.
The architect connected the toilet and bathroom space and replaced two doors with opening wings with one sliding, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in addition there is a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower next to the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doudárova continued.
As part of the "How to Build a Dream" program, the living room was transformed quickly but fundamentally, including architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping into the space, which was created by connecting two smaller rooms, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, such as half-crosses or Japanese walls.
"This would, as a result, violate the openness and uniformity of space," explains the architect.
The sleeping and living parts were originally separated.
All you had to do was turn your back on two couches and put a tailor-made duvet box between them.
The dining area is defined by shades of floor and paint.
On the kitchen floor and dining area, the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived with a patterned wallpaper.
The kitchenette covers sliding panels with wallpaper if necessary.
The new floor from antiallergic marmoleum has many advantages compared to the previous one from laminate: softer non-slippery surface and better sound insulation.
The system of alcoves and ceilings from plasterboard highlighted by color is an example of how you can work with the space in the panel.
I left the colors to the architects, I wished it was happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The compress from the graphoglass with the motif of the blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
The small apartment managed to store books, among other things, in the space under window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
In the remodeled interior works excellent contrast of the new one with the older one, for example with a ten-year-old crystal chandelier and quality objects of art that Ivana collects all her life.
The kitchen came last.
The cabinets were once placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took down their number and rearranged their deployment.
The furniture in simple design is custom made, the white surface softens the slightly pearly surface.
They fit into a small space thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the whole glass wall covering above the worktop.
The unique graphoglass with digitally printed motif is attractive, plus it is perfectly maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers to remind her of her favorite neighborhood she lived in for years.
Now she seems satisfied here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and sink, into the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from a given environment in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
We united the interior materially and in color and tried to make its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of everyday items," adds Kamila Doudírová.
The Supreme Court ruled: Time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former members of the ODS of Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the contrary, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they waived their term of office last November, said spokesperson of the Supreme Court Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the Court rejected the motion of prosecutor Iva Ištnut, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative positions in state companies for giving up their mandates and not making problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, they can continue to prosecute the former Prime Minister, who offered them these posts.
The Anti-corruption Police officer was also arrested with Vít Bartá
Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of members of the VV, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter too, but I cannot comment on this with regard to the protection of classified facts."
According to information rights the case is solved by the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Barta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police President Petr Lessy, whom he allegedly sought to appoint as Bart.
However, the latest information Rights show that the detention of Vít Barta has nothing to do with Peter Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, spokesperson for the Police Presidium, refused to comment on the fact that the case was dealt with by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová told the Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague on Friday.
It is the prosecutor who oversees Bart’s case there, and her words thus indirectly indicate that the file or criminal proceedings are kept under cover.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Barta Kateřina Klasnova in the morning before their residence in Prague's Klaárov.
She was just loading her bags in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement Tomio Okamura commented on Bart’s detention.
According to his words, he has no idea what's going on in the case.
"Vít Barta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was neither a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement Tomio Okamura in the past premature elections to the House in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corrupt case of bribery by members of the Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was illegally sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Then the sentence was changed, and Bart was acquitted.
Sleep: I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospěša, the family was always the first, so at the age of 38, they want to fully submit to it.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or hockey is definitely over.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I look forward to it very much," says the hockey player, who is still in vain waiting for the offer.
Despite the fact that he's a well-known worker who never cheats anything.
Despite leaving his heart on the ice every time, he can take down his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me still is," she says.
Maybe he'll find out, he's supposedly wanted by the New York Rangers, who didn't make it to the season, and they've got two wounded supporters - Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan's attackers.
What's it look like coming to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that I should be signed, but that's it.
There was no such thing as being delivered.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
You haven't heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
That's where the deal really comes in.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it and the team doesn't step.
There are a lot of different factors that need to come together to get the contract.
But in New York, that's what happens, isn't it?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are injured, and the team didn't make it to the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The other thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that is the reality in which I have to live.
You're leaving for America on Friday, expecting something to work?
I've had those expectations since July 5th, when the free player market opened up in the NHL, and there's still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and everything depends on that.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna do the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
On Sunday Vasik has two hockey games, it is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in quotes full-time?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 knee-surgery games.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
One day it gets to a stage where all the goals, wins, and passes don't make up for what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
Whatever job you have.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, first place - apart from family - is also a sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's where family life comes from.
My children, sorry, our children - mine and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would love for them to continue this trend.
Because whatever we tell each other, in America, there are possibilities somewhere else.
That's a chance we should offer them.
So are you planning on staying in America permanently?
We're going to practice this as we have done before.
This means that in summer we will be in Bohemia in Hluboká and in the surroundings of České Budějovice.
And in winter, back in Tampa or wherever our steps lead us.
It's perfect to stay warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it took a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to do this so they can choose what they're going to do and how they're going to live.
How long will you have the will to work, train hard at your age, and wait for an offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it's gonna stay there.
You can't plan that.
So you could say you'd wait this season to see how it turns out and then you'd decide what to do next?
I'm in a phase where I go day by day.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th block of Temelín power plant was postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and approving Contracts of Difference by the government.
These are the reasons CEZ's current management tries to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should give a shareholder a recommendation, not hide behind it.
Government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his YES movement will not have time to learn the political trade in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one.
The chairman of the YES admitted this in an interview for the Law that will be published tomorrow.
Business and marketing SkoFIN is run by Abraham
Its competences include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Luděk Shantora in his capacity.
Abraham has linked his professional career to the automotive sector for the past 14 years.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealer for seven years.
His last assignment was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
SkoFIN was founded in 1992.
Police evacuated a portion of Los Angeles airport for shooting.
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly terminal three.
Reuters, with reference to the California media, claims that the lawmen were shot with a gun from an armed man.
With reference to the police, the Los Angeles Times reported that there was a shootout that injured between two and three members of the Transport Security Administration.
How many people have been injured in total and whether there are any victims but it is still not clear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian rockets for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakiya on Thursday.
With reference to an unnamed US government official, CNN reported it.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli army, when asked by CNN, refused to comment on the raid.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
According to the U.S. government source, the target of the Israeli air raid was missiles and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
AP, with reference to another U.S. security officer, reported that the Israeli raid on Syrian territory was targeted by Russian rockets SA-125.
Israel’s second channel reported that the attack was allegedly aimed at a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, but according to DPA, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Nova missiles.
In addition, they reportedly saw the batteries of the SA-3 missiles, including the command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to Israel’s television report, the recorded missiles reach a range of 35 kilometers and could carry 70 kilograms of warheads.
Israel has reportedly bombed shipments of missiles inside Syria at least twice this year, reported CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed that it will intervene in any supply of weapons designated by Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated the estimate of annual profits and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain.
The Agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to be between USD 325 million and USD 340 million, compared to USD 305 to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12- to 17-percent increase in relation to a record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year, and the second half began to grow sharply mainly in Australian and British travel away from business trips.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards a record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
Australia and the United Kingdom belong here, which are traditionally our greatest profit makers.
During the second half of Australia’s recreational activity business has recovered, which compensates for the slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients were spending less.
America’s trade recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year, and is expected to generate a third year’s profit in a row.
The shares of Flight Centre were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia were transported to St Petersburg
Ecological activists detained in Russia since September due to a protest against planned oil extraction in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St Petersburg.
AFP informed about this today with an appeal to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She also claims that the original charges against her pirates have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil platform were transported from Murmansk Correctional Facility to a prison in St Petersburg," the organization announced.
The reasons for the relocation of detainees are unclear; according to DPA, this was a planned transfer.
The environmental authorities first accused them of piracy, for which they were facing up to 15 years in prison in the event of conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace this charge with milder disorderly conduct, for which there is a lower sentence with a maximum of seven years in prison.
But in today's statement, Greenpeace pointed out that the charges of piracy have not yet been dropped by the authorities, as promised.
They say that means the detainees are now charged with two counts of crime.
The mighty Committee of Investigation last week announced that the charge of piracy would be replaced by a charge of disorderly conduct.
But when 30 prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, new accusations have been brought against everyone," AFP quoted from Greenpeace's statement.
In mid-September, the Russians arrested three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries at Gazprom oil rig.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they've all been held in custody, against whom they have filed an appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
Ecologists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
Today, according to AFP, the CEO of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo said that moving to St Petersburg would facilitate meetings with families and consular staff.
But there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they may be worse," he pointed out.
One of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen asked King Willem-Alexandro of the Netherlands to help.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch was invited to discuss their situation in a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Maliki has a large share in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the struggles in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied in English literature.
The test will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to take a language exam, and they will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should publish a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
Other major subjects are expected to change next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, who oversees graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus on whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain trust in society” and that we need to insist that the graduation test be “more demanding, more ambitious and stricter”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
To compare schools in Australia, they spend an average of 143 hours a year in mathematics and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive math exam – along with more emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards – will probably encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “the real world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in ČSSD
Before the elections, a long-smoldering dispute between two wings fought for influence inside the Ostrava ČSSD was fully lit up.
Everything culminated when Mayor Petr Kajinar turned to the court for the undemocratic compilation of candidates.
However, the actors of the case did not want to comment too much on this, so that the party would not be harmed even more before the elections.
But now the votes of the voters are numbered.
The management of the Ostrava ČSSD immediately on Monday evening called on the Mayor of Ostrava to step aside, and he will probably push to lose his job.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on and who's on whose side he described in an exclusive interview for the Journal.
How do you feel about the outcome of the election?
The ČSSD was definitely counting on a much better result.
Was it damaging to us that before the elections, media disputes within the party were resolved?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now in.
It's a party that has internal problems, it's internally ill, and people feel it's not all right in it.
They made that very clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of ČSSD?
I think ODS has been going through decline for some time now, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy.
It is the fact that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, have moved on to the people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.
Then it has to do with the fact that police are walking around the offices of the Ostrava City Hall collecting computers.
This shows that the ČSSD is not just made up of people who would want the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their good.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps even in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between the Haskovites and the Sobotkovites.
But that too has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foretaste of what is now happening in Prague.
Haškov's wing gradually occupied positions so that after the election it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
A person is in a political situation where he sometimes has to accept compromises.
But everyone has an internal line where they can't compromise anymore, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get on the regional candidate so that as mayor of Ostrava, I would strengthen Sobotka's wing.
But Hasko's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on Bohuslav Sobotka's side and not Michal Hasek's?
I think Sobotka is a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and to some extent about visions for the party and for this country.
I'll admit I didn't hear anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can start calling off the party's chairman.
This is a power struggle regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek did in Prague now ended his political career.
How you perceived that the Ostrava ČSSD leadership did not approve you of the candidate.
Political parties are based on a competition to see who will be both of their members placed.
This competition should be largely based on program visions and the ability of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are people who do not have the ability or vision, but for them, the political party is an elevator for money that they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start to come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruples, they break the party's statutes.
By their practices they make of political parties mafia and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic as well.
It is more important for me to draw attention to this problem than for me to consider whether there is a political future for Kajinar.
It is important that the parties respect the statutes.
Therefore, before the elections, did you apply to the court for a preliminary measure against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of ČSSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by canceling organizations that do not comply with it, purposefully establishing new organizations, gradually throwing away uncomfortable party members.
One example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarík from the council club, but he filed an action against it and they then closed the order on his exclusion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party's statutes through the courts is the last option, but at the time that the other ways and control authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The aim of the leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD, led by Adam Rykala, is to remove you from your position as mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruba Lumir Palyza has a crush on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they gain votes, and then they consolidate their power in the party for the votes.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazala stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could call me a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
Meanwhile, the city bought assets that are strategically of great value to it.
So how do you feel about your continuing as mayor?
The District Committee already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our stay at the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Catch the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy initiating and promoting, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so much development, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a science-technological park.
Still, everything's getting uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than to get in the way of other people to get to the places they want.
Are you still going to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is going to work well, then political parties have to work well.
It's hard to believe that any party will be able to run the state effectively if they can't even drive themselves.
So I'm not thinking about leaving the ČSSD now, because I don't think I'm the one who's causing this party's cancer, but these people are trying to scare me out.
Olomouc will open in the historical centre of the public rink
The organizer of Olomouc's Christmas markets and winter skating said that the preparatory work on the rink started on 26 October and the ice production aggregate has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Both skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stands.
"We have expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire floor area is covered so that the skaters can comfortably change their shoes," he described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the coming Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square to repair the Dolní náměstí.
Repair of Lower Square was completed at the end of summer, so the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right outside the town hall in 2009, when the rink was open from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched on the Upper Square one month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín will be remedied by the Regional Court
The Regional Court acquitted the prosecutions of 25-year-old Slovak and 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men turned down the blame.
They're looking at 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesperson Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court annulled the regional decision and returned the matter to him again for consideration.
He refused to comment on the grounds which led to this from the judge that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the prosecution, the young men attacked a 27-year-old man in his house.
Senior died an agonizing death.
According to the prosecution, he was strangled, beaten, and dug all over his body, and he also had a metal object, probably a gas gun, planted about three dozen blows to the head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures to the cranial bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding to the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
Youngsters allegedly took some 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth some 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, they were only circumstantial evidence against the defendants' scent tracks, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Although the smell marks from the crime scene and other matters coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as factual and not scented clues.
Moreover, there was some error in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
Neither did the emergency services doctor called alert to violent deaths.
So it was only after a few days that criminologists contacted Olomouc doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with any trace of the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
No DNA was found at the scene of the defendants.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary.
Now he is serving 8,5 years, which was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths responsible for the robbery of a jewelry store.
Robbery took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopný.
Younger accused of murdering a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
The reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo at the beginning of November.
On Thursday, the stadium was occupied by builders who will perform the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week of Autumn Strings
Saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will do the end next Wednesday after the 18th Annual Festival of the Autumn String.
Shorter will perform on November 6 at the Lucerna Grand Hall together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžák.
In Shorter's editing for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Autumn Strings will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music over 60 years ago.
The list of artists he worked with goes from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he met Czech musician Miroslav Vituš and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade they indicated the direction of a new style of fusion.
He's been performing especially with Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past 13 years.
Some afterparty after the festival will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on 9th November at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the local audience will be presented with the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which will bring the electro-jazz form Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The ladies say they forbid UEFA from publishing sentences for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chair of the Czech Football Association's Arbitration Commission, stopped publishing sentences for judges.
The UEFA rules forbid it, which she said in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, it is said that the FACR would be in danger of being punished.
Damková also refused to take sides in her role as football players from Pilsen, where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to the criticism that has been raging since Plzeň recently played twice as much penalty as other league teams.
Thus, although in recent months the FACR has stopped publishing sentences for referees, Damková assures that judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever match it was," Damková said.
The reason why penalties are not published is, according to Damek, a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes violations."
"We're very suspicious here, and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop this, there will be harsh sanctions," said Damková.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If it continues to publish information, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we couldn't be filling the program to raise referees," added Damková.
The capture of Barta is related to Janoušek and Bem: Is he behind the wiretap leak?
On Thursday, police arrested the Chairman of Public Affairs Vít Barta.
Along with him, Jan Petržílek, head of the Department of Analysts and Informatics of Anti-corruption Police, was arrested.
The detention is related to eavesdropping by lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
News server.cz confirmed the information about the reports, with which news server News.cz, to the Czech Press Office a reliable source.
The wiretaped phone calls of Janouška and Béma, published last March by the daily Mladá Fronta Dnes, in which both men address each other as "Mazánek" and "Kolibřík", show Janoušek's influence on the actions of the city under Béma's leadership.
The journal then stated that in 2007 it was acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the ABL Security Agency.
That's the one Bart owned back then.
News server.cz pointed out that the arrested criminalist Petržílek worked for BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was supervising the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the impending effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act as of 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the companies’ representatives questioned said that they had not dealt with matters related to both key codes in their society.
It follows from the survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In connection with the approaching date of effectiveness of the two key codes, at the last moment, a number of managers are only beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the laination of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether revolutionary changes will eventually take place or not.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to new law for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of the companies intensively involved in the new codex, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to prepare them in time.
Furthermore, 35 % of companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, every fifth firm has not yet dealt with recodification, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that the issues of recodification have not yet been dealt with.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent) for the largest number of companies questioned, followed by the solution of business conditions (16 per cent) and changes in the cadastre of real estate and liability for damage (ten per cent).
One of the most important innovations of the whole recodification will take place in contracts, namely the unification of contract regulation only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercial Code will cease, resulting in a more transparent state of contract law for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom of relationship arrangement," explained attorney Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Podán.
In connection with the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
Next, the topics relating to changes in the assembly and the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent) follow.
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and potential impacts for statutory bodies, especially when the company is in danger of bankruptcy or gets into it.
"In practice this means that if board members and executives of companies do not act with the care of a proper economy and do not avert the imminent decline of the company, they may lose the benefits gained for the performance of their duties for the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to develop Cartier style as a living language
It is my job to maintain tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explaining in an interview for HN its position as Pierre Rainero, director of Cartier style.
This French luxury house was founded in 1847.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team will treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the CNN Heroes Award of 2013.
In the CNN Heroes of the Year 2013 competition, you can vote for him or any of the other ten main candidates.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital in 1981.
At first, he was treated with only a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he created a hematoma that caused him problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years delivering his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, where he received such a treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to get there first, but you're not.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon per 5,000 inhabitants.
Just to compare, the ratio in the United States is one doctor to 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could visit a doctor, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of their health expenditure in that country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy life with poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a surgeon for a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded ASCOVIME, a nonprofit organization whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people cram into vans, attach themselves to the roofs of medical supplies, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: reception, singing and dancing and the best accommodations the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his broad smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in local cheers.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or gifted glasses or birth certificate for free – a document required by the school, but which many destitute families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, at a town hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to a recovery site to make room for another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and sanitary equipment Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay awake and continue working, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said that after hernia surgery, he'd be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his nonprofit activities; the rest covers private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't have obtained at home.
"We thoroughly washed hands and removed blood stains or held his instruments," says O'Malley.
You'll never experience that as a second-year med student in America.
Students volunteers usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive at Yaounde, food, transportation and study provide them with Bwelle.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life, and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
It's not a burden for Bwelle to have a constant struggle.
Helping others to live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain - that's why I'm doing it.

Minister Holcát has renewed the position of Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 000.
"I consider it essential for this function to be clearly defined and formalized, so that the nurses have a representative within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they can always turn, if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that he deserves to be given proper attention by the Ministry.
It takes not only high professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will gladly and with all responsibility try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients to carry out their calling with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the public's eyes," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Senior Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová also stated on the occasion of her entry into office that she wants to deal with various aspects of the job position of a nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educational professionals, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I do not want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but I do see them standing next to each other, each having their own responsibilities and, together with other healthcare professionals, forming a coordinated working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks are unnecessarily burdened by nurses and are taking away the time they could and should devote to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas that he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve cooperation in the team and with health service providers’ management, regulating competences, as well as employment law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code, or not overloading nurses with their insufficient number of times and places.
We often hear anonymous homesickness, which, for fear of possible sanctions, are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the Czech Head Nurse could serve as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and having a specific case examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nursery (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursery - pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been head of the department of nursing and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at a bed in the internal department, also as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the main sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several specialized textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
♪ So I don't hate myself ♪
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After long years of reading, he lived but did not write, he publishes a new novel called Wind, Darkness, Presence.
The number of pages comparable to his most famous work, Houstina (Petrov, 2001) suggests that this will not be a thin volume.
For Salon Kahuda confessed another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't hate myself.
To see the new and new clones of this foolish human pettyness, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavor.
I don't even talk about us elders, faces ruined by powerless lusts, vassal souls, and opposite-soldering ideologists, who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a small selling whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jurodic friends, weirdos, and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of life on this planet.
I like to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamppost at night.
You're talking about feeling wasted, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break came a long time ago, about ten years old.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, that's when I lived.
But there's still a quiet boy in there that's surprised.
I see other lone trainers, everyone in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved from writing books.
I'm taking part in this giant, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The vast, breath-taking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, when the way of trial-a mistake arises another and the next generation of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artistic intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self - speaking, or rather, a dialogue that is conducted by the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
As the periods of peace are crossed by silently asleep metastases of wars, which may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt a silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day it'll quietly overwhelm me.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and lays down to layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness".
The neocortex, the gray cortex, asks older evolutionary formations, goes to ancient year-rounds of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heavens above me.
Eventually, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you speak metaphorically of ego - can you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to a constantly variable presence, in an ongoing effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there's overload disorder.
Analogically - as if you had "falled down" PC, from the speech emulator program and translator from foreign languages you would get confused first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarts ended up in a dark green flashing Bios screen, in a basic system that controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For someone who has not yet understood what we're talking about, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
Do you mention her often - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling, and behavior, a breach appears.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He gazed into the abyss so long that the abyss looked into it."
A pure feeling - that man is lost, if all hope disappears, mentally "died" and a new quality begins.
And why do I care in person?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once one fell into the pool and drowned, days, months and years ran, he kept drowning and reading, and the books taught him how to swim - to live.
He's become a diver.
Perhaps a sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal's texts once did to me.
To what extent do you think about the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best described by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the speech and sentence formulation process."
From early youth he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine Captain Nemo, ran through the Shadows in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branching of the authors and their messages, it reads: "The sun of the bright worlds of other Karl Hynek Mácha".
And when the book's out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On a retro-reflective reflection that gets to you through people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read 500 pages of the text.
And then, years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult life decision.
Books are actually "life" or rather "worlds".
They're coded into letters, bearing experience, the history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them to life, we let their sentences flow to their brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, you - as it happens - await a chain of authorial readings.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you going to jump back in again with joy, or do you feel different after years?
Today, I prefer to just tell the story.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they're inconspicuous, they don't draw attention to each other, they have friendly radiations, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give you an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec lived was (and I hope he is still alive) one curly bookshop (it's called conveniently Červenka), a cheerful fellow and a good girl's bull.
At one drinker, he introduced me to the individual articles of the strings of readers of my book "Houstina."
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a shredded, read copy of my book.
In embarrassment, I put down the jerry and wept briefly malely.
We all stood there silently, swaying and crying intoxicating.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't stand it, and with a roar he jumped headfirst out the window into a snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night country, and the happy rabies of the sensitive, sore soul of the compatriots, and the sadness of the lost patriots - howled and pampered like werewolves until morning.
Each one of your books is formally and materially different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, darkness, present?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts the words of an old Russian myth in the mouth of the folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog on it, a gray box.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
We may have been devils in hell a long time ago, drawing lots - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let that flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, influences our desire from such depths and in such a breadth that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, with absolute certainty, we do exactly in the depths of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with influx of dopamine, mixtures of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes it becomes a disorder and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various faults, standing on the ocean coast unconscious, and into a leaky tarp made of dirty handkerchief catches the influx of watery wind.
I have to write to be human.
Obama Retreats From Health Care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama stepped away from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With hundreds of thousands of statements from Republican providers in recent days, the President has been accused of being deceived by the American public.
Yesterday, Obama bailed on his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called "disturbing in the media" about the statements, Obama called on Americans who received these announcements to look for new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive healthcare program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You will get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the people who have purchased insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Available Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans straight: you deserve better," said Sebelius in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Available Care Act, said that the launch of the Internet market has been "poor" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Irritating Sebelius said this sentence, which was captured by the microphone on, yesterday in the direction of a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee meeting, which took place after a heated exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, on whether she herself had to participate in Obama's care program.
More than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly asked why the “architect” of the Available Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and he did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you gonna be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the meeting and according to various sources from the agencies and from backstage is said to be in hand.
The transaction notice should come in November, probably before the start of the auction frequency for LTE networks, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the brand Sazka Telecommunications launched the auction frequencies for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, the company's taste in telecommunications was not discussed.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecom boy Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing manager of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and lastly he ran the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to transfer existing customers to its network from its own virtual operator.
This would probably not normally like Vodafone, but according to the information of Hospodářské noviny, this could be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender on the LTE network (as a newcomer it can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone may not be auctioned at all or will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Saza.
Vodafone will release Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend the saved money on some fixed Internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) obtained immediately a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, he's a big pier waiting to be restructured.
At auction Kellner would have acquired the LTE network under O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
From next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech Television ever be able to do without signing events?
As President Zeman’s era entered the legendary ashtray scene, it is not difficult to listen to complaints that collect evidence of the castle’s company’s prosecuting.
In the past, no one has documented the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Třitík in this way, let alone sign it.
That's right, the editors stood up for the management.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where some journalists are attracted to the Zemans - whether this is a direct order response or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathic accommodation.
And since we assume general depravity, we cannot forgive the question of whether the change in circumstances on television are not sought by other, no less unscrupulous, powerless interests that have not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth is that those who say that there are no hard attempts to intervene politicians in the media in developed countries.
But the truth is also that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
Complainers do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticise what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this situation is not with us.
Yet, in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about evil politicians and good journalists may also be more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of an unclear situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings comes upon themselves.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of power
It is almost a rule that, at key moments in the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to fulfil its state duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential term and the events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could have flown across the border, heavy weapons could have been destroyed, and the government could have fled to London right away and not fought hard for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, that capitulation wouldn't make a nation hungover to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman, and in Munich he was still in shape, but during the war it started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
If he was any better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Ho.
He was elected "the president will not get into a situation of decision-making".
But he had to, although the big decision with the knife on his neck at Hitler's chancellorship probably wasn't.
Until the last days of March 1939, František Moravec, the intelligence officer, told us what should be done to ensure that the occupation he knew about for the day did not go so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, both they did not believe him, and they were afraid.
The human ruin of Gottwald had his aged comrades executed, as Moscow commanded.
Ludvík Svoboda definitely made it impossible to participate in normalization and they had to decompose him, already completely senile.
That Husák was powerless and sick depressive old man things in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only positive thing.
Havel was lucky they hadn't met him in office in the last few years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his achievements give the impression that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
Head of State and Chief of Armed Forces looks what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic right now.
Or maybe it's a threat, just not to be seen.
Then the question is whether exceptionally it is not a good thing (from a historical point of view) that the President is not fully strong.
It's not normal.
Couldn't we have elected president in this country once again, someone with acceptable thinking and acceptable health?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasizing about alien life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter throws lightly.
In the conception of his quartet, which will conclude this year's Strings of Autumn festival on 6 November in the large hall of Prague's Lucerna, everything is related to everything.
Wayne Shorter's partite of the jazz saxophonist quartet is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber matter and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is a newly 80-year-old Shorter - extraordinary composer, holder of nine Grammys, former teammate of Miles Davis and today's probably the biggest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain.
He does not talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I found it best to be surprised at life.
"Too many people plan everything and then are disappointed when things turn out differently," Shorter says.
As insects from Thailand picked up the sales of the Paris bar
You may sneer at insects, and you have no idea that you eat about a pound of them voluntarily each year.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and a unique experience you also have taken care of.
He placed the insect offer first in Paris on the menu of his business at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, the cook and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, whose title was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, would be found in a fashionable 18th district near Montmartre, a widely visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can taste not only different larvae, locusts or water beetles, even scorpions can taste here.
Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (to prevent insects from damaging their wings, from hurting their feet or from damaging their eyes) send Davirons all the way from Thailand.
Europe is still learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris bar, with a pioneer menu, presents several reasons for eating insects.
The first is an ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron said to Reuters Station.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant a pleasure, a feeling of sin and an atmosphere of environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would probably be thrilled by the idea of eating a bug decorated with pesto, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
They say even skeptics will eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest bites and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these degustation plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the state’s interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measure, save substantial amounts for heating, but also for building companies and construction materials producers.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of state fiscal policy, there are significant leverage and multiplier effects, and it is also one of the most important growth measures.
The Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore strongly disagrees with the Government's resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps to enable further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be announced within it.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lány.
What kind of health is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the US defense stance on his surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented confession, he said that in some cases, espionage “has gone too far.”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for treating the NSA as an “autopilot” in the face of the aggravating revelations about the NSA spy activity that emerged thanks to informant Edward Snowden.
The published information has caused a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Through a video-link to an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have been going on since there was this possibility, referring to World War II, the difficult Cold War period, and then, of course, September 11."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the border, but he emphasized that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far. ”
And the President is determined to try to explain and clarify this to people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA organization strive for good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are struggling with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to killing and blowing people up and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented planes from crashing, buildings from blowing up, and people from being executed, because we know how to learn about these plans in advance.
On Thursday, the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that US legislators are going to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that they still need to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disillusioned by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Indeed, it is important for the US's national security interests that Europe should stay on board with us, in view of its joint efforts to combat terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the presiding Senate subcommittee on foreign relations for European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programmes.
News in the media that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstood metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States,
Another revelation quoted Snowden’s documents that NSA was tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone and 34 other world leaders.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended allied espionage as necessary and said that it was a common matter from both sides.
In the midst of Murphy's turmoil, he said that his office was planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, hoping that members of both parties and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to engage are to be published.
He said there was still work on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the trip was to help correct relations, he added that “well-meaning educational measures” would be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spy programs that they have been using for years.
"While we are modifying our monitoring programs to better protect European rights, they must also recognize the fact that we are not the only ones who conduct espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland as planned this weekend to respond to the hostility that the US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran have triggered, as well as American surveillance activities.
Aussies appealed to stay in Thai prison
A 21 - year - old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 - day prison on Phuket Island, falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with perjury on the island of Phuket on June 15 when she told the Thai police that a taxi driver, along with two other men allegedly holding her, attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, the footage of the industrial television later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket Island police conducted interviews with Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low security facility on the periphery in Phuket instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra in his daughter's case.
Tunks told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about her daughter’s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is certainly a difficult time, but we hope that they will return to us safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime she had spent her vacation in the holiday area Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in an adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to correct a damaged picture for tourists, which may well have been behind the liberating verdict.
Jigger joked, "Breakout Goal"?
He got a puck in the defense zone, and no one caught him.
Moreover, the escape transformed after a quick forhend loop.
Jaromír Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night 119. winning goal in the NHL commented on the Facebook social network.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svoboda heard from the Czech Railways Director and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" he wrote at the beginning with the exaggeration Jagr.
They say we're a lot alike.
I guess I'll have to quit night training so I don't go any faster.
"I am afraid that the Minister of Defence will then contact us and want to advertise the jets!" added the emojis.
Plus, New Jersey scored a second win in a row.
"And most importantly, you have noticed - Marie Rottrov's treatment is working," said Jagr.
Post-election tenderloin post-election goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a lot of losers.
It is not only the parties that have not even made it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of its internal split.
Politicians served us a post-election goulash this weekend instead of a holiday candle.
Andrei Babiš, who promised voters to change the political style of government.
The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and the split in the winning party record the political (from)will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even vote for the party that President Zeman publicly supported in the Chamber of Deputies.
While the President has lost his strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to get it back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While ČSSD's chances of getting the Prime Minister's seat in my eyes are getting further away, Andrei Babiš's businessmen are getting closer.
The post-election development is still a mile away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the left-wing scenario of the ČSSD government supported by the Communists, this development is better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Given the loud resistance of YES to get together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the coalition ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 Members).
Due to the division in the ČSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak parterre in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations can be quite depressing for the ČSSD.
Minority government of ČSSD, consisting of "nezemanovci" at the Castle, probably will not pass.
Moreover, any government that the ČSSD will participate in will be threatened by the unsatisfying ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further division in the party.
So I ask myself, "Do we not succeed in the next premature election?"
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the YES movement.
The ČSSD plans for introducing sectoral taxes, increasing income taxes more significantly or building a state bank hopefully fell below the table.
On the contrary, the parties to the ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Dawn agree, for example, to promote business, moderate fiscal policy (the government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The friction surfaces are most common in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
YES now has the upper hand, so the program so far most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would rather lean to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better result than the left-wing tax program on everything that is still moving in the economy.
