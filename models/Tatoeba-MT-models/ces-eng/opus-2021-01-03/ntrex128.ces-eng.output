Members of the Welsh Assembly fear that they will “look like Muppets ”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are dissented by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal are plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name might cause ridicule.
One member behind the Labourist Party said that his group fears that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
Member of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was not "happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said that his group approached a change in the name “with an open mind,” but noted that MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, said: “The final decision on what members of the Welsh Assembly will, of course, be on the members themselves.”
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on proposals where broad support was given to call the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in the public debate.
The members of the Assembly apparently propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can bring concern to President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation within a few weeks.
The Reform Laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and a proposal for a system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will vote on the question of their title in the context of the discussion of the new legislation.
The Macedonians will vote on a change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether the name of their country will be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
All people's votes should resolve a decade-long dispute with a neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of a northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek territory, and repeatedly protesting the country's membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes plebiscite about changing the name, said he would not follow the vote.
But referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be quiet because the churches in Harlem are struggling to survive.
"The old people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr Adams.
"There's neither today."
He thinks the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are seeing each other in a different way today," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
With regard to churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such types of people who will not be much help to the remaining shrines in the district.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and so soon the day will come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who will move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose religious activities were held nearby.
St. Martin took over the black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the retailer boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
The fire damaged the building in 1939, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered the chimes.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the chimes of the poor.
The expert who played the chimes in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a bigger bell game in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says he wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, the complicated story of architects and builders has been taking place at St. Martin's, some of which were called by lay church officials, others by episcopal diocese.
The Council of Elders – the head of the parish, consisting of lay officials – sent a letter to the diocese in July expressing his concern that the diocese would “try to pass the costs” to the council of elders, although it did not participate in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark wounded a 13 - year - old boy in California diving for lobsters
According to official report, a shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy who was diving for lobsters on the day of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7am near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy call for help, and then paddled to him with the whole group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first considered the call to be a joy of a lobster catch, but then “he realized that he was shouting ‘ Bite me!
He bit me!"
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had torn the entire area of the collarbone. ”
“I shouted for everyone to go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It is unknown what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles at the press conference said the shark was spotted in this area weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities for investigation and security have closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to face the Boots, Superdrog and Debenhams chains with beauty alleys in the style of a department store where specialist salesmen will be available.
As part of the strong accession to the UK cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household goods are declining, the cosmetics lanes will be tested in 11 stores across the country. In case of success, they will then spread to other stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to supermarkets’ efforts to find applications for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves, and household supplies.
Sainsbury's reports that it will double the range of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and first mention brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also be given to the existing range from brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to brand places similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket also redistributes its range of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers increasingly require.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the franchise of the Fragrance Shop perfume retailer. The first such shop was opened last week in Croydon, south London and another one will be created this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and moving towards buying small amounts of food everyday in local shops means that supermarkets have to try harder to attract people.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will look more and more like department stores because the supermarket chain is trying to better offer services and non-food products to combat discount sellers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened up the Argos branches in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of departments of Habitat, which are the chains that he bought two years ago. This has made food sales more profitable and acquisitions are even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to redecorate the department with cosmetic and pharmaceutical assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after an argument about the distribution of drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds drug chain.
Lloyds is supposed to play his part by adding to four stores an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The business director of Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the cosmetic alleys to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and tempting environments and convenient location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is "angry" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the 11 million-pound contract.
The star of Dragons Day Peter Jones is "angry" after television host Holly Willoughby resigned from a $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand so she can focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to Goop by actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
Thirty-seven-year-old host of the show announced she'd left on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged Dragons Day star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was “angrying” when the TV star, at a tense Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of new contracts – worth up to £1.5 million – would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of home clothes and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared to Goop by actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the fortune of moderator Willoughby at an estimated value of £11 million.
When 37 - year - old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly’s brand, Jones left Britain for one of his summer homes.
An unnamed source states: “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would secure her for decades.
Her decision to leave was completely shocking to everyone involved.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sale goods at Marlow Central."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to a large investment in pillow and candle products to clothing and home clothing and a possible further delay in branding.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as Chairman of the Board of Directors in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin in the I'm A Celebrity ITV mode.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
Difficult behavior "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism that he would get from journalists as a remark that some consider “unworthy president” and how he speaks positively of North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump answered with his mocking "vote" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in June Trump appreciated it as a big step towards denuclearizing North Korea, Kim was interested in another meeting.
But the nuclear-weapons negotiations are deadlocked.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a prominent North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “corresponding response” to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
According to him, his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results – ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about relations with Kim.
"It is so easy to act like a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people from outside to this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and pointed to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami wave and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, in the situation following the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs have learned that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been expelled from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit difficult," says Mrs Sumbung.
The Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work here.
The spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, Mr Sutupo, said that Indonesian workers are evaluating the situation in Paul to see if it will be possible for international organisations to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the earth is still woefully unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not common at all on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens in Paul’s warning against the tsunami, even though a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
Even in the best time travel among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that docked in Lombok and helped earthquake victims is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
Improving poor Indonesian infrastructure was President Joko Widodo’s campaign’s main point, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year, he will seek re-election, but his government is plagued by funding outages.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of faith.
Street struggles between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of over 1,000 people, and tens of thousands have driven them out of their homes.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in 89 minutes on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters outside Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball on his left and fired at a remote stick.
The bullet flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually jumped the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as fast as possible, so I wanted to buy as much time as possible.” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach me, so I didn't think about it much, and he fired at one touch."
Chelsea in half-time led 1-0 after goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The assailant Blues sent the passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted halfway across Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball.
Then he sent the ball down the beautiful aisle to Hazard in the lime.
He escaped defense and ended up with a left to the remote pole next to Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15 o'clock, Liverpool will compete with the local team in the Champions League group at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will be playing in London on Thursday at 3 p.m. with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of the tsunami wave in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Authority stated on Sunday morning, the number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis climbed to 832.
The 7.5 degree earthquake struck on Friday, sparked waves of up to 6 meters high and imprisoned many people in the ruins of collapsed buildings, said Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesperson at a press conference.
The city of Paul, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old male suspected of stabbing a woman.
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on people in the neighborhood who saw or heard something to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan says: “The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation,"
The police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the crime scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
The police said there was an investigation going on, and now they're informing the victim's relatives.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't speak.
The residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to return home.
One person was told by a police officer that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, "That's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape, and another was waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the closed area who monitor the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and give code 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament has recently become a hit over an argument about "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical puritanical followers in the Taliban style destroying a host of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history."
The chairman of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, comments: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character would become one of the targets in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconoclasm in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th-century view and part of the history of the figure that many still think deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although a little less than at the end of the 19th century today, to be a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig tore up Chinese farmers
According to local media information, a pig farmer was attacked and killed on the market in Southeast China.
As the South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man whose only surname “Yuan” is mentioned was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a pigsty on the Liou-pchan-shui market in Kuizhou Province.
The pig breeder is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Si-ning, China, Qing-chai Province.
Supposedly, on Wednesday he arrived with his cousin from the next province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next pigsty was open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on his mouth.
According to the forensics, it was confirmed that a 250-pound pig tore the farmers apart.
"My brother's legs were all bloody and torn," Guiyang Evening News quotes a cousin named "Wu".
The security footage shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
The manager of the marketplace told Evening News that the pig was closed so no one else would think of it when the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reported to be negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but they have happened in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically injured a man.
Ten years earlier, a 300kg pig pushed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and drove him away until the farmer's wife.
After eating his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "starter".
“They’re just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring heavy rain to the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecasting to weaken and move above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, it will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
At 5 o’clock in the morning of Eastern time, Rosa reached wind speeds of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure furrow is forming and moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, she will take the form of a tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture northwards into the southwestern part of the US.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday.
Tropical humidity, approaching the low-pressure furrow in the following days, will cause heavy rains in the southwest of the US.
Precipitation between 25 and 100 mm locally will cause dangerous floods, debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity causes rainfalls to be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Some places in the southwest of the USA, especially above most Arizona, are expected to have 50 to 100 mm of rainfall.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, floods may occur.
Given the dangers of tropical rainfall, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
Strong rain can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and storms bring local shock winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure furrow will bring strong local rainfall on some parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation over 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller debris currents and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, unique tropical showers begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays, the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Horns and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes throughout the US, because the Arctic will begin to cool, but it will still be quite warm in the tropical zone.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the US on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few today, they will try to re-extend the continual summer heat.
In most territories in the middle and east of the US, a warm start is expected to be in October with temperatures of around 27 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeast of the US.
In New York City, on Tuesday, it could be 27 degrees, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview was followed by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's eye-catching statements from the candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and announcers interrupted routine programs with news of a sudden Friday's twist: an agreement brokered by Senator Jeff Flake for Arizona, about the FBI conducting a one-week investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching her drunk at a high school party and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his aroused statement that he was 100% sure it hadn't happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen were watching the event.
The company counted average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations that broadcast statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at offices.
For comparison, it's a similar number of viewers who watch football matches in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest ratings of all stations when, according to Nielsen, an average of 5.69 million spectators watched him during a full-day hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
Interest persisted even after the end of the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After this moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS recorded on Friday morning how protesters shouted at him when he was about to take the elevator to a court committee meeting.
CNN was streaming live as he stood with his eyes down for a few minutes and let himself be called names.
One woman said: “I am standing right here in front of you. ”
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are helpless. ”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added more to the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the court committee was to vote on the submission of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and some other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that, without an investigation, Republicans wouldn't have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "politics" about Brexit.
In an interview for the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politics" over Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the Prime Minister on the front page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect their duties against each other was “absolutely senseless.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the death of an LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a case of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to Sims police, he lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel belonging to CBS, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson, according to the police, admitted to shooting Wayde after the interrogation.
According to the attorney, bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
Sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked local police for "sanding for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
Last season he had a mean of 5.6 points and a 2.6 jump to the game.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said that Wayde's death had "shaked" the team and "shocked" him.
"This is what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ashes on Mexico City
The ashes that roll from the Popcatépetle volcano hit the southern district of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcanic activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a series of rumbles and tremors.
Images of car windscreens covered with a thin layer of ash in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, have appeared on social networks.
Geophysics recorded an increase in volcano activity, located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital city. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a power of 7.1 degrees.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters for independence met with the police and thousands were involved in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence, which was divided by Catalonia.
Orderly police have blocked a group of masked separatists throwing eggs and powdery paint at them, who have created dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Later, too, there were skirmishes that police had to use batons to calm them down.
In a matter of hours, groups supporting independence sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of the protesting supporters of the Union who called "Live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, tensions in a region seeking independence remain high.
Voters voted largely for independence, but participation in elections was low because opponents of seclusion boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to put an end to voting in electoral rooms in violent clashes throughout the region.
The independence groups stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
The 68 - year - old electrician Narciss Termes, who and his wife participated in a separatist protest, said he was no longer hoping for independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we are at an impasse," he said.
Despite the important, albeit close victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence-enhancing parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their best-known leaders either went into exile themselves or waited in custody for their contribution to the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old fitter Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting in prison for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will be running for European Parliament next year.
"The candidateship in European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and repression that we are witnessing by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after the car hit the house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were imprisoned after driving repeatedly into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone fired a crossbow at the car.
Meng's hit secured Livingston's 1-0 victory over the Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured the victory
Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and only awarded Steven Gerrard a second defeat of 18 games in the role of manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to be crucial when Gary Holt's team made it to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team doesn't yet have a victory in the Premiership League on the guest field, and next Sunday, the first Hearts will stand on which they lose eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has expanded a series of undefeated games in the division to six games, so the head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, hasn't been beaten yet.
Livingston didn't take the chance against the bland guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he failed at the gate, then Alan Lithgow just missed Craig Halkett's head just before the goal.
All the landlords had to do was watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could trouble the guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers was ordered a free kick and Livingston created a loophole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent out Menga, who the ball in the middle of the penalty zone flowed and scored.
At this stage the Rangers dominated in possession of the ball, but the home defense for them was impenetrable and goaltender Liam Kelly mostly did not have much work.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow missed another standard situation in Livingston.
Two penalty kicks – after Halkett’s attack on alternate Glenn Middleton and another by the hand – continued to fly into the penalty area of Livingston.
“Finomen” from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and continue to overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves great commendation for how he has stirred up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, he led a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert the whole time.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't reach these standards anymore.
Their endgame was weak – only once penetrated the home side – and it should be a wake-up call for the Rangers because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan had a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the sky was blue and everyone smiled.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to correct relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this city, the largest Turkish population is outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting outside the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them Kurds – were protesters against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Opposing protests reflect the controversy of a visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Accident in Deptford: The cyclist died after a car collision
A cyclist died in London after a car crash.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with busy Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death occurred only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the site of Saturday’s tragedy in the accident on Childers Street when the driver drove away.
The Metropolitan Police said that police are now trying to identify the men and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, buses travel on alternate routes, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in the riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in a male high security prison riot.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still last.
To cope with the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialized guards from the Tornado team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on site.
A prison - service spokesman said: “In order to handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison workers were deployed.
Six staff members have been treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer time behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden ended up in the hospital after the prisoner was attacked.
And last October, police forces were called to prison for serious riots in which the staff was attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (the area where there is drought can benefit)
It is not usual for a tropical low-pressure wake to hit Arizona, but this is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and risks flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning on Mondays and Tuesdays from West Arizona for South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix, Twitter, said that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or pressure below within 320 km of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict rainfalls of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona with up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the centre of the Rockies and the Great Pan, it is likely to fall from 25 to 50 mm, with local aggregates of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the area has been affected by drought.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these rainfalls may even help, because the Southwest of the United States has just hit drought.
Weather.com reports that according to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona experience at least “extreme drought”, which is the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa’s journey will lead first to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still on the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific, and thus loses its strength.
They're expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfalls will be strong, a great risk of flooding.
"In the area from Baja California to northwest Sonor total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected, with the potential to occur up to 250 mm," reports weather.com.
Rosa then travels like a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and arrives on Tuesday morning at the Arizona border, then passes through Arizona and enters South Utah late Tuesday night.
"It is expected that the main risk of Rosa or her remains will be very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and desert southwest of the USA," the National Center for Hurricanes informs.
These rains are expected to cause fatally dangerous floods and debris streams in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area at Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As the police of Avon and Somerset informed, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Cops are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “experienced wickedness and rage” Democratic Party
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the unscrupulous and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "experienced wickedness and rage" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he decidedly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing on her charge, Ford testified.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the Americans witnessed Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage.”
He said to his supporters from West Virginia that "the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with excellent public service."
The President was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it was for Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats chose "resistance and obstruction".
The Republican Party's leadership advisor told CNN Station that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor is expected on Friday at the latest.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people, and the number of victims is still growing.
The authorities announced on Saturday that after large earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesian island Sulawesi, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which swept away the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people met on the beach in Palo on Friday. At dusk, however, the coast hit up to six metres of waves that killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people continued their activities on the beaches and did not run away immediately, so the waves fell as a victim," said the spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave didn't go alone, it took cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave on the open sea spread at a speed of 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city even on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released by Friday’s strong shocks was about 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb that was dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could increase the tsunami wave even further.
Nugro described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found wedged under the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugro reported that the amount of casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palo, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, communication was "absolutely crippled without any information" from Donggaly.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected sites.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement says.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not inform that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
The amateur footage shared on social media shows how a man on the upper floor of a building with a desperate scream warns people on the street of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the coast will hit the water wall that carries buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the alert immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Pal, so the authorities could hardly coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palo evacuation center on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggaly arrived in the city of Paul, where employees were hiding in a cell shelter built in the yard of an office building, they saw images of destruction, says Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began their sad disaster relief activities, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies, and personnel from abroad can only start to flow to the site of calamities when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," says the spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross, Aulia Arriani.
"Once the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start international aid, but this is not the state of affairs yet."
When the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paul, friends and relatives of those still missing, they kept hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday the paramedics freed a woman who was trapped under the wreckage next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon described how, in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages through WhatsApp to contestants from Palo who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means that messages have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling up the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning in addition to the ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
When he did, another man “run out from behind Brink's employee” and stole a bag of money that was to be put into an ATM.
According to the press release, the Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Report any information on the identity of suspects to the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West is changing his name – to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: “The existence formally known as Kanye West. ”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and he used the pseudonym as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
Change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album Yandhi.
The show will be replaced by Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", as stated by the creator of the show.
West had previously said that, in addition to shortening the current professional name, the word has a religious meaning.
"In my opinion, "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," West let himself be heard at the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with the Big Boy radio host.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
It has changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to a mere Ye - as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
Many other famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known at different times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love (Love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West's co-worker, JAY-Z, also alternately wrote his name with and without the link and with large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the approaching 50th anniversary of the blood attack against students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatellolco Plaza that he would “never use his army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements were spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968, began shooting people at peaceful demonstrations in the square and killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who are studying and by opening other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education drag young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published the AI announcement, even though the US as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced a plan last year to be the AI innovation leader by 2030.
"A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are much further than the US and are looking for another breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the AI area would be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “Superpower AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that surpassed the best American player in Othello, and later he was a research executive at Microsoft and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated previous US government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge, and asked when he would be next to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic tops don't do China, they do corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been employing the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, the United States, changes in immigration policy could also help to improve efforts in the AI area.
"In my opinion, the holders of a doctorate in AI should automatically be offered green cards," he says.
The Council of State of China issued the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Council and other government organizations handing out money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, says Lee.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to engage partners in the industry and academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of a Selection Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF Foundation is concerned, it now invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
But US legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a few decades-old dispute with Greece, which blocks applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour is entitled to its territory and therefore vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of the electorate would come along to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the successor countries of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the roof of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no problems were reported within 13 hours.
However, voting attendance was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters eventually cast their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the Macedonian referendum on a change of name that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls out chairs in front of tents built by people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the door for the servants," Kavadarkov says.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he voted.
According to him, the result of "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a referendum could take place between 30 and 43 percent of voters – less than the required turnout.
Another survey organized by the Telma TV station in Macedonia revealed that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, 50 percent plus one voter must participate.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since its onset last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came for a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took out Brighton's defenses on Saturday to secure Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguer's presentation, his goal looked ridiculously easy in 65 minutes.
It all started with a pass that Argentina's attacker got in the middle of the field.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and got into open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's fine territory, one defenseman got around and a few others got ahead of him.
Next pass to the left, he found Sterling.
The English attacker put the ball back in the penalty zone to Aguer, who, with his right hand, beat Brighton Mathew Ryan with a bullet to the right side of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," the City Pep Guardiola manager announced to reporters.
“We thought he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky he scored in that moment."
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League game was arranged by Sterling.
This goal fell at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to the remote pole.
The attacker Sky Blues dropped the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there were not many reasons to re-embark.
But the forever competitive Scherzer hopes to take the place of a pitcher in a game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday – but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one match over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have a chance at the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least play a game, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I will experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are supposedly inclined to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
It would be the 34th start for Scherzer. On Thursday, he trained and pitched on Sundays, when he usually has the day off.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has 18-7 statistics this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump appeared at a meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly commented on the situation surrounding his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he talked about how important it was for Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
“In November everything we have done will be at stake.
We have five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones - I'm not running, but we're still on the move and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power with whatever means necessary, you see the wickedness, the repulsiveness.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they have to beat to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not gonna give it to them."
According to him, democrats have opted for "resistance and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying, "the Democrats are angry and evil and repulsive and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to the loud mooing of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse opinion stream.
He is intolerant of those who express their views
When the Momentists in my local party voted in favour of my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs to be told that they are not welcome – because they have sincerely expressed their views.
My fellow Parliamentary officer, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in a reminder that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday’s Labour Party meeting at Nottingham East said that “we want meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years that I was a local member of parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today do not take place, and the promise of a "kinder, kinder" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is assessed as to whether they are acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, who I thought we had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and hold positions that I would otherwise not agree with – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then there is a tirade of swearing on social networks, calling for my appeal, condemning Wednesday's policy and telling me I shouldn't be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because comments pointing at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face every day a rush of sexist or racist insults, but will never give in.
One aspect of this era of politics, from which I am most disappointed, is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse current of opinion, and with every proposal to censure or change the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I've been advised to stay away, not to answer so much, and then "I'll be fine".
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since 32 years ago as a student of the school I joined the Labour Party, provoked by the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who literally let my class of general school fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who need it most – whether as local councilor or minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is opening up to Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not addressed to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting on what I think is the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late fives distorted the final result a little, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
Now they're at the forefront of the table, the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of the chances that helped the home to win, and Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"In our fights we passed great tests and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All the honor of Ayra, they took a better chance than we do. ”
Grant Anderson's five at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numbers and Jason Baggot won the unaltered five.
Climo raised Ayru's lead penalty and then scored at exactly halftime and turned solo, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the other half well, and Patrick Anderson's five, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground on a stretcher, and when the game started again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowall he turned Climo.
Acting Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card and Melrose again used the extra player thanks to the unaltered five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
The landlords returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clim without a ball, MacPherson from the penalty lineup laid the ball behind the advancing maul of Ayru.
Climo turned, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing to pick up the fifth home cook.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry, and it has been found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show that he writes and in which he plays along with Greg Hemphill's longtime comedy partner.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last series of the series, and it seems Kiernanan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the extract from the official register, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the report, but the source of the daily Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to engage in a “prosperous business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol outside the naval headquarters of La Paz, which is decorated with rope.
Above public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the motto: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It's our duty to get it."
In all inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country lost in favor of Chile in the bloody war on resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to renegotiate the Pacific Ocean.
These desires may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court to decide, which should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and calm and, of course, expects a positive result," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of MSD on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after many decades of interrupted talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate that Bolivia will give sovereign access to the sea.
The charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle ahead of him about re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely for the court to rule in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, power would not change.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the latest arguments have been made shows that the case was “not complicated,” as Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, says.
And for the past four years, not only have they not supported the Bolivian cause, but perhaps they have slowed it down.
"The current Bolivian government seized the question of access to the sea," Zarate says.
He adds that Morales’ offensive rhetoric weakened all remaining goodwill to Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will act again one day, but this will make it extremely difficult to have discussions.
Both countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia a “exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused to use the question of the sea as a political crutch – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the US can be trusted.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to make promises made to the summit of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it seems that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to reboot a nuclear diplomacy that has been at a dead end for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a “flame of hope” that the ongoing US sanctions and objections to the Korean War-end declaration could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about consenting to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris shows show that your fashion shops are about to arrive with the latest trend of huge headcovers
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a number of crazy giant head covers for their spring/summer 2019 collections at a fashion week show that captivated everyone.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the piers.
The exhibition piece by Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge resembling feathers that flooded model heads.
Other oversized accessories were adorned with melons, a witch hat, and even pineapple – but they are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment with snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with great fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge caps could even arrive at fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come after the "La Bomb", a straw with a half-metre wide cremation, which was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the runways – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as a swimsuit model carrying it.
The dark orange rafio bag lined with rafio fringes and equipped with white leather handles was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus at the Paris Week of Fashion.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the next summer – given that the designer was so successful with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for excessively large additions.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have had a number of academic achievements, and this continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities underline this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) has more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, representing them with the best possible service levels for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart."
It is an important observation that if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year's exams show that languages are at the top of the tables, while independent schools have the highest degree of success.
A total of 68 percent of pupils learning a foreign language achieved the best grades A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students reached the highest grade A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects chosen by pupils are as weighted in the study plans of independent and other schools as are STEM courses (sciences, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the lack of language skills is due to the reasons given by employers as problems in job vacancies.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaking more languages automatically gains an advantage over competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 between 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, being French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have several languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing educational environments that children prepare and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may be.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will introduce himself in the Lakers jersey for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time are about to arrive.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday opening game of the San Diego preseason against the Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes it'll take.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play for a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
"I don't need preseason matches at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is about to launch a wave of campaigning in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November elections.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight, and how can you track him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below via live YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearing the candidate for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court this week, and he was very tense about the allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it's expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be postponed for a week before the FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help the Republicans pick up the pace before the November elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers President Trumpa say that these five meetings next week aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
"Control over the Senate is so important for his agenda that the president will go as many states as possible during this busy season," said the spokesperson for Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could come to the Wesbanco Arena meeting in Wheeling and be watched by the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month Trump visited West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morriseye that the president has to come to help him in his surveys," says a political scientist from West Virginia University Simon Haeder, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team has shown that it has the stomach to fight to keep hope from Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday’s couples can be just what Ryder Cup needed.
A swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where does the pendulum go now?
"They took six points and now it's four, so we take it that the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of leading by four points, and there are still twelve left.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly when he went from batting to green, and he's an example.
Celebratory screams intensified in the sequel of his round when he mastered the key heel to win the whole game when he and Tomas were two holes behind.
His putt, who won them a game of 15 holes, met with a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder cup.
The strange, but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four, and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but missed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning."
The course and way in which the energy flows towards both the turbulent audience and from it confirms that these are players destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sundown over Le Golf Naitional there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both on a different hole at the same time.
But talk of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning game of four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The hole and two doubles on the front nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in the abyss from which they no longer climbed.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of it.
Two pair games on two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow interaction by people in pairs, advice they give themselves, advice they don't give themselves, and the way strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the last day, but this game of two couples has also shown that the US team has a stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
By the final day of Ryder Cup Europe leads by scoring 10-6 points
Europe will get a healthy advantage by the last day of Ryder Cup then from Saturday’s games pairs to two balls came out with a head start of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly almost won twice over the wrestling Tiger Woods, decided to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games on two balls with the American side that failed in the 3-1 series.
The US showed more resistance in four, won two matches, but couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend got nicknamed "Molliwood", are only the second couple to win four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game of two balls even then smoothly beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5&4.
Woods, who ran through two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in a pair of two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after playing two balls in the morning, went back to partner Henrik Stenson in a pair game on 2-1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world ranking.
But Europe did not have it on this pleasant, fresh day, southwest of Paris, won across the line.
The three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two ball game and returned later to beat the pair Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a pair game, despite losing the two first holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a double game, although as the defending Furyk's party only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, the Sunday counterattack seems to be behind them.
North Korea says that “no way” will be disarmed unilaterally and without trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said that continued UN sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States, and in such circumstances, the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm itself unilaterally."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “progressive” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step of the way, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization simply because Pyongyang had been through it in the past.
Ri mentioned the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 when Kim undertook to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea’s security.
North Korea is pursuing a formal end to the 1950-53 conflict, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to release severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on “denuclearization first” and increases the pressure on sanctions to force its targets and even object to the “declaration of the end of the war”, said Ri.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions increase our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader emphasized at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were to be a party to this issue of denuclearization and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on US territory was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which threatened "total destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take action to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea was completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this, he said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: “The enforcement of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without ceasing until we are fully aware of the complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suppress the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly party, and Pompeo declared that next month he would visit Pyongyang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made just to make North Korea say within hours that he was making “gangster demands.”
North Korea has committed to meeting Moon this month to dismantle the missile site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He stated that Kim had announced to him that the “corresponding measures” in which he hoped were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and was heading towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course to teach them enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University forced all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho studies all night long, when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics found that students at the world’s most famous university are often clueless when it comes to the basics of self - care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and the female hospital, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to begin the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's medical services, said that the university decided to set a course after finding out that students were seriously ill during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student dormitories where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another part, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "studying all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation switches the brain into a hunger mode, so one is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes attended last year during her first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push on the course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended students to consider setting the alarm for the time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that may upset your circadian rhythm, leading to falling asleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal sunk Gerrard's man
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox party tried to record its first victory from 4 to 1 February of the triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team only caused Gerrard’s second defeat in 18 games as manager to abandon his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the line-up of the Rangers seemed uninhibited and determined to settle.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston is climbing to third and right behind the Hibernian team, as opposed to one goal.
And there could be other Rangers problems after the bar judge Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that swept around Ayr into the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who took the Hearts point last week and would be happy to see his well-trained team stifling their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have taken possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after Meng first let Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the backup guy buried his big chance.
A far-off kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only have tried in the back post.
The Rangers took control, but in the last period there seemed to be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a penalty for a quarter-hour lead when he and Steven Lawless collided, but ref Steven Thomson took the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots to target in the first half, but former goaltender Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the header from Lassana Coulibala and tame shot Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener after 34 minutes could've been against running the game, no one could deny they deserved it for the hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga to an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost an immediate result when the wing collapsed into Morelosa, but impressive Kelly fought his way from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game of exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkettt hit one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran off the corner.
Alternate Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to punishment when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and is still growing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
At that time, Geiger Counter became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", the leading role of those seemingly improbable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What on earth is this? ”
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of the atoms in the minerals.
Evans: “Oh, yeah, he's really cracking up right now! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and then rivet again injected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect dangerous cells, disappeared ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so that they can “see” the protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-injected into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we've developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “controls the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were collected from patients and “leucaemia” were“ taught” to focus on cancer cells, was already promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in pro-Trump sermons, in his maga cap, after his performance on the SNL.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live after a confused performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, wearing a make America Great Again cap, he started spitting at the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, “How can you like Trump? He’s a racist?”
If I were into racism, I wouldn't be in America anymore," he said.
SNL started a show of parody with Matt Damon in the lead role in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's rape charge.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's theatrical speech footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to the audience that he had been able to eat his head ornament behind the scenes.
“Behind the scenes, I was bullied.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the wrong place?” and added that he would “put on his superman suit, because that means you can’t say what to do.”
Try love."
His comments have only earned the buzz of the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL looked offended, embarrassed, says Variety, and one person even said, "The whole studio has gone silent."
West was invited as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing a song I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR CONSTRUCTING THE DAVA."
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was just who he was, and that is absolutely amazing.”
“But I DON’T WANT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’), which I believe represents and sends out to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us," she said.
Before the show rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly named Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was killed on Friday at a restaurant in East Belfast.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant should stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The charges filed will be examined by the state's attorney's office.
The game Thrones Star Kit Harington has embarked on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
The actor, 31 years old, however, stepped out of the stereotype of macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to earn respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit told journalists that he believed that “something is wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was “really strong” on this issue.
"At this moment I personally feel, quite strongly - what happened so bad with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we are seeing here?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of male toxicity due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do guys learn on TV, on the streets, they make them feel like they need every man to have a side like that?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because a young man has certainly changed for the worse.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel Game of Thrones after completing the series, because he had had had enough "fights and horses".
As of November, Kit will be playing in the restored Right West of Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set, so he gave me my future family and my whole life after that," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy show award-winning Emmy.
A couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official numbers, over 820,000 people are affected by this virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, reported by Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people year on year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be still widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would let the GOP Senators' data slip away, lashing out the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, American MEP Maxine Waters denounced the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three Republican US senators to the wikistránka of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were supported by "ultra-right" scientists and websites.
"Lie, lie and other despicable lies," Waters said in her Twitter statement.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on sexual abuse charges by candidate Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which sources contributions, is linked to the Waters office and has published information on Waters staff members, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - was by no means responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including the one from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests he doesn't have the temper to be a member of Congress."
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They must not be defiant.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and not get excited."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to democrat criticism towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had warned “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with British tendencies, which seems to be the case of this reviving of Johnny English in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this insolent satire be on the subject of how obviously a bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this bulging, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to screw things up again in a whole new way - that name more than anything else by signaling that there is a broad comical work intended for a non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
Of course, he's the stupid undercover agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean, and a big piece of that guy who took a single note in the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 Olympic Ceremonial opening ceremony in London.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man who was once played by Atkinson in forgotten TV commercials by Barclaycard, who left chaos behind him.
In this last edition of JE there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blade was briefly clinking about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite undersized and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more as if it were intended for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy tramps are as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's person.
Permanently, the current assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret spy web network and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of an agent on duty - far too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and biased figure who already suffers from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this wannabe Theresa May character as best as possible, but there is nothing much in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that once her every active spy is compromised, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director at some luxury facility, is also giving a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to School of Rock.
English went back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering partner Bough, who was played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a sub commander, an affected figure that Vicki Pepperdine may even be a little wasted on.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in the packing of Her Majesty's Secret Service assignments, meeting the beautiful femme fatale of Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the ominous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their Odyssey full of frenzied misfits: masked as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when smuggled aboard Volt's luxury yachts; and English triggers pure anarchy when they try using virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
I'm sure all the aces are ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and turbulent it is, it has something in it from the children's television.
It's kind of a moderate thing.
And just like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't imagine: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour deny that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week and get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the heads of the company to pass on savings to workers that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they'd still take the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would be "favourable" to the party's economic agenda and plan to turn the country to the benefit of its workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to use changing economies.
A long - term Labour member said for the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits the party's attitudes towards balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not our party's policy and does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has stated that he is committed to returning energy from "anonymous directors" and "experts" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return to their overall share, because the Labour Government could carry out "aggressions" on the basis of perceived wrongdoing.
It also confirmed the plans to put workers on the board of directors of companies and to create own-ownership funds, which will transfer 10% of private equity to employees who are entitled to receive annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh might have changed their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could swing some Republican senators into dragging their support.
In an interview from Sunday's "60 Minutes," correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to a hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charges came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
But Graham's decision is unshakable.
"I have already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh, and it would mean an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival music event will be held in New York, offering a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, email to the world’s leader, phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way they convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of "clicktivism" - people who feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet will make a difference?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by his supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures of over $37 billion to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the hedged funds still have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and realists who committed themselves to “help children grow to their full potential,” promising Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as yourself, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history," Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions that called for U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website, asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and the anti-partheid movement, we will succeed before us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the performers of this year's New York year's Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy for a "blockade" that would prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may “if necessary” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zince, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our navy, to make sure that the maritime routes are open and blocked if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not directed to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the event organized by the consumer energy alliance, a non-profit group that is regarded in the US as the "voice of the energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they were practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or the replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-purpose" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration is coming because the Trump administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin “the hostages” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a position from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the third state interfering with our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to look closely at the presidential candidacy in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the mid-term election, she would "closely look" at the presidential candidacy.
During the Holyoke City Hall meeting, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the top female position," said The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take a closer look at the presidential candidacy."
Warren mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
"I fear to the core what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open to her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-ranking democratic names mentioned in connection with the potential candidacy by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin to meet Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after his return may concern other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries with which our soldiers are returning," she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “a elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that“ they return a little different, return toughening, return and ask if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the army, gives their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with a domestic assault on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a drunk weapon, reported Dan Bennett, spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal call for new US government measures that deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts on Friday in Washington, Washington, issued a short report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, according to NBC.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Organization against Federal Policy in August, was not revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of a violent gang” abused her, but US officials refused her a request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s advocates described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing ubiquitous gang problems and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the US reversed the decision of the Board of Appeal for Immigrants in 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Prosecutor General Karl Racine of D.C. stated in Friday's statement that the new measures "ignored decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers further briefly argued that a policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the US economy and says that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work”.
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
"Azyl is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or because of political opinion," he said in his statement of June 11.
Asylum never intended to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the number of victims has already doubled, race to find survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish little boy at the evacuation center in the parched city of Pal.
“Every minute the ambulance will bring more bodies.
Pure water is rare."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, choosing through drenched things, trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were paralyzed.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture to the spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside for continued severe subsequent tremors.
Tears filled his eyes when he described the feeling that a violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page ad in the American daily devoted to the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump mentioned a China Daily bonus paid in the Des Moines registry - the state of the biggest sales paper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere with the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the American elections marked what US officials said that Reuters was a new phase of the Washington escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, which is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
Chinese retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's valuable tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast to the newspaper stand on Beijing street, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic path, given that the media belongs to the company “Chinese Communist Party”, he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish the offer” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans are leaving their voters before the election for the Kavanaugh debacle, warning analysts
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaug, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming mid-term elections they would see a response, especially from women.
The emotions around this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record are already saying they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be put back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute to pursue an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “The November is coming!” at a demonstration in the hall of the Senate, where Republicans who are in charge of the judicial commission decided to name Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's been a long time, that's true."
However, it could be higher, especially among reluctant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her charges of sexual assault against a high court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, resistance might follow.
"It was a confusing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in committee or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, head of US priorities, a group that helps vote for democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in the opinion of whom to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the second appointed.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Ford testified in front of the senate court committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had drunkly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web network plans to start a new internet and to outrun Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the objective of the Inrupt project was "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all simultaneously.
What is unique about a personal online data repository is that it is up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
Society calls it "personal authority through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to the CEO of John Bruce, to bring resources, processes and corresponding skills to help Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some of the employees working on the project cooperated on the project and community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his paper on the media published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The cleric’s celebration that was given to Victoria’s Cross during World War I
Celebrations of a hundred years have taken place since the only spiritual Church of England won Victoria’s cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never found out that he received the highest British military award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone to him on Saturday at the Rushden parade, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “geniusly symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victorious act.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Lt Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very thick fog and strong shooting of field guns and machine guns."
Later he got to the front line and with the "highest courage" led the line forward before he threw himself into the firing field and knocked out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that was humiliating.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the parade led by the youth group Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that “he felt a great honor to participate in the parade, ” adding that“ the trepidity of a true hero is manifested by the support provided by many people. ”
The MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206 instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the bloated Bellator 206 just to deny you the main event.
The San José receipt included 13 points, including six on the main card, and live broadcasts took place all night in Great Britain at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, audiences in Great Britain were amazed when the news turned into a show about Peppa the pig.
Some remained unexcited after waking up to early morning hours for a fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the change in the show for children as “a certain form of bad joke.”
"According to government regulations, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and children's programmes must be broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of the Bellator after being asked for this transmission.
"Peppa the Pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they will work on the program so that in the future the audience in the UK will be involved.
"I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it," Cooker said.
“But there is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not make it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when that program changed, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried with all our strength to keep the promise given to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less valuable" because of sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to follow success.
A 24-year - old athlete said that he didn’t realize that “not all are like him ” until he entered high school.
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke out about gay rights to give others “hopes.”
He also said that his ability to become a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-term show Kirsty Young had a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared to be a survivor in Laverne's first program, said that he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him, because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: “Up until now these feelings of inferiority and otherwise were real things that gave me strength and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone", said not to disappoint anyone who would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Bronze Olympic Medal has become a high profile LGBT rights fighter and has used his presence on this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he heard from him because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and to give others hope.
This three-time world champion said that he was falling in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “he caught him off guard.”
Daley took the Oscar holder, 20 years older, last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said that it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, a couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley said that his whole point of view had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been all “I want to get a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't agree to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front lines.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about it my whole life – jumping in front of our domestics at the Olympic Games, I don't know how to feel better," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song – Heather Small’s stream – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and kept giving him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on a bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson would have made a record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup, but he would have to tune up the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played every two years on the record of the 12th, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench on Saturday's hurballs and hursoms.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the U.S., a five-time main winner spent his day alternately between cheerleaders and working on a line of games he hoped to correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, not even at the top of his career, so he is not the ideal choice for a narrow course Le Golf National, where long rugged terrain routinely punishes stray missiles.
And if the golf course isn't disturbing enough in itself, Mickelson faces the exact British Open Francescu Molinari champion, who won all four of his games this week on the rookie Tommy Fleetwood team.
If Americans, who had four points less, had launched 12 separate swords, had escaped the rapid onset, Mickelson's machine could have proved to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and gave nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, pats me on the back, puts his hand around my shoulders and says he will be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“They trust each other so much.
He's a member of the Hall of Straw, and in the past and this week he's been so helpful to these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine him playing two machos.
I imagined more, but that's how it evolved, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Fald's record in most of the Ryder Cup Wests played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of Ryder Cup's career, which has never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson achieved 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence as a team brought some intangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people, and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the fun of going to see him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the great lead to the singles of the last days in Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dan debuted at a game in Valderram in 1997, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they made it to the finish line with a very tight 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
"You must keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only close," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching them win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6 in 2018.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it wasn't over.
Tomorrow you'll be bored out of your mind.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have a target, and that's to try to get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased with how his players did on a complex golf course, added: “I could never do it on my own.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
They're preparing individual performances tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with your partner when it's going well, but when you're supposed to be there on your own, your golfer's capacity is fully verified.
That's the message you need to give to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will take care to make his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big twists when he was part of the winning team in Brooklin to end up defeated when Europe reached "The Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 captain, encouraged his players to head to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklin, as in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts considerable pressure on the middle matches.
That's how we set up our routine and made the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to be doing magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to counter-attack Rory McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I went with that group of boys in that order, because I think it covers the whole trip, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
The German new warship has been postponed again.
The latest German naval frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one more year due to faulty systems and snowy coasts, reported by local media.
According to Die Zeit, the leader of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, a brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigate, was now postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was to become part of the navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after delivery made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will serve as replacement for the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the top ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time they were put into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate got into the newspaper last year, when the German navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy ever returned the ship to the manufacturer after the handover.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of major "software faults and faults on metal elements" defects that would make the warship useless when deployed to the fight.
Software malfunctions were particularly significant, as Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will operate a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the staff needed at the Bremen class frigates.
It has also shown that the ship has a considerable excess weight, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as the class-like ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides defects in metal elements, the cost of the whole project – including crew training – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price has risen to a staggering 3.1 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates have become significant, especially in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, confirmed that the naval army was really "run out of ships capable of deploying."
This representative stated that the problems were constantly being packed because the old ships had been decommissioned, but no replacements had been provided.
Lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's frigates were capable of becoming part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
There is a new research on the habitat of bats in the Highlands in Scotland to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt food.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help manage future activities to preserve this species.
A study conducted by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by bats whistling and smallest and brown long and watery in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas in this bat settlement to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings detects the frequency of calling bats and what individual species do.
Subsequently, a map of the habitat and a report will be released to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are the most important to bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of working on habitat management, such as creating meadows, and best practice in maintaining wooded areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain are largely declining in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials, as well as cat attacks, may also pose a risk.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful in hunting prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, colony controls and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reservation in the Three in Dumfries and Galloway housing estate, home to eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson, the housing manager, says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Three we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and best habitats.
But there is still too much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us understand better what they need to survive."
It emphasizes the importance of controlling bats before the start of maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that unconscious destruction of one mother's nesting site can kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to join in and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many species that we do not know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape charges "false reports" and said that people "want to make themselves visible" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who reported these charges.
This Portuguese and assailant for Juventus was accused of raping an American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Supposedly, he subsequently paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, to inform Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the press release of the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers, calling information "false news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time gold ball winner for the camera.
“They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I am happy and I am fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to charge Der Spiegel with unfounded accusations that they have described as "unacceptable reports of suspicion in the private area".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will claim compensation for “moral damage equivalent to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations of recent times.”
The alleged incident was to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suite and in the casino in Las Vegas.
When they met at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the arcade, where, according to the documentation filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, they reportedly raped her anally.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" of a "knave" and failed to "one percent".
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed he paid for sex, but he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "feared of retaliation" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking retrial because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronald at the time of the charge of attack one step away from the transfer to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer he was bought by the famous Italian Club Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain “will regret forever” if Brexit loses its world leader status in car manufacturing, said Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“A deal is necessary,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of a delay at the border in the absence of a Brexit agreement could cost jobs.
At a plant in Burnaston, where cars Auris and Avensis are manufactured by Toyota – they produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have noticed a halt to production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other car companies, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW reports that it will close its mini car factory in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers refer to as risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on the basis of deliveries “just in time”, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU delivered for cars produced on order within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be borderline disruption, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plans for reviving future relations with the EU are “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We need an agreement. We want the best trade that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the grasp of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The proof not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run it warns that added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is chairman of the trade unions in the race, said that the members of the trade union are becoming increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places have disappeared, they will never return.
The government spokesman said: “We have set up a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, reports the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with General Rod Rosenstein's acting attorney could be "decommissioned for another week" because he continues to fight for the position of Supreme Judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the special council of Robert Mueller, who examines the interventions in the Russian elections, the ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible court obstructions by the President.
Whether Trump releases the acting general agent and threatens Mueller's independence, Washington gossip has been feeding on it for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed so that she wouldn't interfere with hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee where they gave testimony to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, thus delaying the Senate's full vote again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox Channel news on Sunday.
When asked to meet Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, perhaps it will be necessary to move another week with regard to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always communicate the current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by an aversion to "theatrical" television reporters, even though she said: "I disagree with the fact that they will perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before," she added, without providing evidence. "We looked at the numbers."
The conference will continue, said Sanders, but “if the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly have been better than talking to me.
We've been trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks, and there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with attending senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
The health minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to avoid fear of Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to SMEs less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to settling the costs of requests for the state of settlement of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer the negotiations between Great Britain and the EU continue to take a stand, and they are heading for the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible scenario of distance without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reassure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial for the patients and communities we provide services to.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our fervent wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie progresses emergency surgery after head injury
Deployed defenseman Tigers from Tennessee Christion Abercrombie advanced an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 by rival Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics put oxygen on Abercrombie's sideline and then put it on a stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
A functionary from Tennessee State told Chrisz Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the type/range of injuries” are yet available and that the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, sophomore in red T-shirt, takes the first season for Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday he had five total procedures, which means a total of 18 surgeries in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher real estate tax when purchasing real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher real estate tax if they buy real estate in the UK, while the extra money will be used to help homeless people in the new Tory plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's move to attract young voters
The increase in the obligation of higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
Expecting an increase in the Treasury by £120 million a year – to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy a real estate in the UK, while the extra money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May announces today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and a focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in real estate purchase tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while money will also strengthen the government’s efforts to fight sleeping without a roof over their heads.
The surcharge, which is an addendum to the current property purchase tax obligation, including the higher levels introduced two years ago by other houses and the purchase for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury is expected to increase the funds by up to £120 million a year.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London are purchased by 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, driving out prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the ladder.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spirit cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the property purchase tax to help more young people to their own first house.
He accused large construction firms of holding real estate prices high by taking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to correct the “disfavor of home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced an engaging series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the termination of the 'negligible' evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime ministers to restoring the British dream – so that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and shape life.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to be able to buy houses as well as hard-working UK residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too distant and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to control Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that it is his "highest ambition" to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
42-year-old Scots enjoy the challenge of restoring the Northeast Club, which currently holds a third position in the First League, only three degrees below the summit.
This summer he went to the Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B rank and it was," said Ross on BBC Scotland's Sportsound Channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that pulls me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club."
Ross’ predecessors as Sunderland’s managers were Dick Advocate, David Moyas, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety about the succession of such established names in such a big club when he had previously refused foreplays from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success would be measured for me at that time by the question of whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment in this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I'd probably feel successful if I could just put the club back."
Ross has only been in the lead for three years, before being assistant boss at Dumarton, and spent 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Club Alloa recover from descent into the third group and transformed St. Mirren from beginning decline into the winner of the title of champions in the following season.
And Ross says he's got a much better feeling now than he's ever had in his career players in the clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably real intersections," he recalls when Allo took over.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than acting.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money and enjoying reasonable heights.
But acting can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I keep going through them from the point of view of the stress and the pressure of the job, but I just feel good about being in charge.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel like I feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life."

Research found that the perfect time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the incomes of British pubs struggling with difficulties, but has increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s consulting firm, who produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened even further in July.
Up until now, pubs and drinking bars have done as badly as the restaurants have offended themselves.
Pubs, whose main sales are from food, also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 percent per month, while the sale of food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the analytical company of leisure activities and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has lasted since the end of April.
The weather and influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual drop in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing pressures on costs.
The long hot summer cannot be a worse time for food business operators, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much needed relief."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the British sector of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an established industrial benchmark in the industry.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that hides from their parents.
One in five children – only 11 years of age – has a secret social media account that hides from parents and teachers, showing research
Research among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “false Instagram sites”
News has raised fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the pupils said they had a “main” account that parents knew about.
One in five children – at the age of only 11 years – creates accounts in social networks that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “false Instagram accounts” in which they share photographs.
Reports point to the concern that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the pupils reported that they had an embellished “main” account that parents knew about, while they had a private account.
One mother who stumbled onto her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website found out that her teenage girl was encouraging others to “rape her. ”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headstresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, while half admits to keeping private accounts.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an inefficient director at the annual Steering Committee General Meeting.
Doyle is the most prized light athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of sports like those for whom her far-reaching international experience will be useful over the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland to be a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes, and I hope to be truly beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who won a total of four gold medals at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, won a total of 200 and 400 metres, and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell me if I was going to get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've done a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing exercise!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
The milk-sucking apparition of mothers to cows divides opinions online
A company engaged in the production of suctions divided online opinion by advertising, which compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of the launch of the "first silent absorber in the world", Envi's consumer technology company released a music video with exaggeration that shows the freedom that the new suction gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn full of hay with cows for a song saying, "Yes, I'll eat, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed I don't have udders, my breasts are here."
The choir continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, drink my lovely milk. ”
However, the advertising that was posted on the company’s Facebook page triggered controversial online reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of which reported that it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
Elvie suction is applied discreetly to breast-feeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added: “The commercial is completely off. ”
There were also those who defended advertising, while one woman admitted that she considered the composition “infectious”.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breast-feeding.
Suction makes me feel just like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's for the record.
It is a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another said: “It’s a fun advertisement focused on mothers who suck their milk (often at work or on toilets) and feel like “cows.”
It is not an advertisement to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet suctions hidden under their bras.
The campaign concept is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's suction tube is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and hides beautifully in a breast-feeding bra, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold a child and even walk while suctioning.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added a comment: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and milking cows, we wanted to point out the milk extraction and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable incredible feeling of freedom that the new suction will ensure.
It's not the first time Elvie's suction got in the sun.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers, designer Marta Jakubowski, appeared on the pier, who was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp on the Texas border
In spite of the fact that the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of migrants arrested has increased sharply, especially because hard rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the companions were traditionally made up of immigrants without documents who were afraid of endangering the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the Agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for the status of escorting single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household are illegally in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," said Mr.Albence.
According to asylum workers, representatives have introduced new rules in order to process child matters more quickly, requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of being detained, instead of earlier standard 60 days.
A lot of them appear through a videoconferencing call instead of personally declaring their case legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who, according to the report, are not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely he is to develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbursts of rage or attempts to escape, claims asylum workers, and reports from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say that these concerns are raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are indications that the child is suffering, more likely not to be noticed, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or farewell to friends could cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria announced that US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” should immediately withdraw
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called after the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the eighth year of war is already underway in the country.
Moual, who is also the acting prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that “it will be handled accordingly.”
"He must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moual insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria was almost over,” with more than 360,000 people perished since 2011, and millions of others lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present foreigners" were removed.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria that are mainly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of a war-torn country.
When giving up refugees by Moualem, he declared that there were good conditions for them to return and accused “some Western countries” of spreading “unrational fears” that caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have approached international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no help for Syria to recover until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last refuge of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward in political debates.
Russia-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces shielded by Russia on the province where three million people live.
But Moualem pointed out that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military intervention would be directed at jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters, with ties to Al-Qaed, who would “be exterminated.”
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition, will soon take place to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to “checking the articles of the existing constitution” and issued a warning against intervention.
Why Trump will win in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won the next elections in 2020, if, as many liberal observers are probably hoping, the prosecution and scandals would not have ended his office as president prematurely.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, ratings in prime time have more than doubled to 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average audience of 2.4 million in prime time, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased the ratings on cable TV to 3.5 million watching the main night news.
"It's a heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of "Designed Survivor" on ABC drama about the Cabinet Secretary, who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
Why? she asked
"He said, "Because he's funny," Mrs Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of having fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story of Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether the immigrant families can reconnect and benefit the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you're an informed citizen when you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses the "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's ostrich leather jacket worth USD 15,000 ("dressing arrogance" as Washington Post said) and the consequences of Mr Trump Storm Daniels' disgusting depiction of "anatomy."
Among other things, I'm not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, out on the north shore of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in question.
"I remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money flows to the tightest home races in the medium-term elections
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a financial inflow thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which generated two holders of office in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the reconstruction of the suburban district of Pittsburgh by District Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who acquired another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is heavily overlapping with the new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans, the maps were redrawed.
The race in the new 17th district started with a fierce financial dispute between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump won by 20 points in the precinct.
Politicians give democrats a slight head start.
America is considering fine Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners judicially evicted Trump's organizational team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to call off the US director of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “unfortunate decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore,” said Minister Heather Nauert’s spokesperson in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the fines were only considered against Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including funds to control narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial assistance and focusing on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading for the US.
But by mid-September, the leaders explained that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively complete any fines considered for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal the administration puts on the meeting, said diplomats.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without having any new unwavering news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst close to government executives and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible obstruction of Mr Trump's law enforcement, which is now in public records, could be the definitive nail in the coffin.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller is said to have turned to whether Mr Trump's campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If there were an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have to take responsibility to this institution, just as he is preparing to re-embark before the voters, and in the end he would probably be expected by a jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of 'if', and I do not want to say that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable - as with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how much longer the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to hold a coup against Hitler, all they had to do was get the Western powers to stand up to him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
The Americans are now faced with several similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been on edge since the report announced that he had secretly proposed to record the president last year and speculated that he was in no state of health to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote in mid-term for Congress, which will place Mr Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, democracy will have a long dark night ahead.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on a swastika table.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Rapide Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians would give them a great deal of hope for the G Group of the European League after an impressive draw in Spain on the Villarreal course earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented backup Graham Dorrans from showing up on the field for the first time in the season until 2-2 with Villarreal. However, he believes that the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to a game with faith that we could grab something, and we took a point.
We may have been able to multiply it at the end, but overall, the tie was probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half, but we got better at the second half, and we were better at it.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard, because they played a good result in the last game, but with the spectators behind our back, I'm sure we can push and it's going to be fine.
Last year was pretty hard, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong, and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training is good, too.
I hope we can get back to it now, get over it last season and be successful."
Women are worried about their pension savings
Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people in the national study said that they were discussing the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said she talked to her kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not willing to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how to take care, as these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: A consultant can help you find a way to cover these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed by traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance, which will help you pay for these expenses or by own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles while you can.
Choose a healthcare representative, who will be a trustworthy person to supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you cannot communicate on your own.
Also consider writing up a power of attorney for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your accounts in case you are not qualified to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent urgently needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Put these details in the written plan to be prepared.
"There are not only finances in the game, but for example what are the names of treating physicians?" asks Martin.
“Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan ready at hand."

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
As communication is out of order, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the regency of Donggal, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
After the outbreak of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, and its population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The regency, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economics of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also significant, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggal several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Tsunami struck west of Donggaly even in 1996, when she claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and earthquakes regularly occur here.
Here's a list of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 degree earthquake hit the south of the Indonesian most populous island of Java and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake hit one of Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic because it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami has formed, but more than 100 have died because of falling buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when his female friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took Pal's phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, reports KTUU.
According to a network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, claiming that he felt “definitely innocent ” when he was asked to comment.
Palin faces three class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with class B infraction punishable by a one-day prison and a fine of USD 2000.
It's not the first time Palin has to face criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged assault on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently before the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics related to the incident.
Allegedly, he punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by war veteran groups in 2016 when her son’s violent behavior was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
An Earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electrical and communication networks are down and the numbers of victims are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck directly at the friction of a part of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there was a video depicting a moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding an exceptional death penalty for a suspect from a terrorist attack in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died – an exceptional punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly launched an attack on a bicycle trail along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan with a rented Home Depot truck that was swept away by pedestrians and cyclists.
To defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries – this is how the terms of the intention to grant the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the court documents, both figures would mean the possibility of granting the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipo of 22 crimes, including murder charges for extortion, which federal prosecutors normally use in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” claims the prosecutors, describing the way Saipov carried out the act, as he was abominable, cruel and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," he says.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court last issued the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York City in 1953, when a married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who were proved to be a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal remorse according to court documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching Islamic State videos on his phone.
The police also announced that they also requested the flag of the Islamic State to be posted in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “obviously disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of being released will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
A team of Saipov's defense attorneys had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
According to the Conservative Party, he should be entrusted with the Brexit negotiations of NIGEL FARAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party conference, Nigel Farage committed himself to mobilizing the people's army.
Former UK Independence Party leader said that politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own members suggested, he should be conducting negotiations with the EU.
On the march in Birmingham, a conservative MEP Peter Bone said that Britain would be out if Mr Farage were to be secretary for Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in appeasement of her ranks, where there is a deep division, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting to stay in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her compromise plan from the Chequers running under the attacks of the Brexit supporters, the proponents of staying in the Union and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group will gather in Solihull, where he wanted to "screw the Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would already be out today," he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: "I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to ditch the Chequers."
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to have to listen.
In our own country we want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone has rejected the proposals that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to remain is completely wrong'.
Conservative supporter Brexit Andrea Jenkynsová, who also attended the march, told reporters: "Simply I say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and our party members do not like him or our activists who are currently filling the streets to get elected.
Forget about the Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says: 'Minister chairmen will keep their place when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said that conservative politicians must 'get into an awkward situation' if they wanted to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we stand here today to say to them, "We will not let you do that."
In his report he added to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
"Now we are mobilizing an army of the people of this country that has secured us a victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain that rules itself."
Meanwhile, proponents in the Union marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners to the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend opening of this party's operation.
Labour MP Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for problems with the party's security application after the conference was opened.
"These are people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"The whole thing is a farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit,” he added.
Warren's planning on thinking about running for president.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren declared that after the November election, she would “think carefully about running for president.”
Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts has spoken about her future on Saturday at the city hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting November's re-election against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could confront Trump in 2020.
The event at Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come “for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, including a woman in the highest place. ”
He was arrested by a suspect in the shooting of Sims from LSU.
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that she apprehended a suspect from shooting a basketball player at the LSU Wayd Sims team on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 AM of the ET News Conference.
A video was released from Friday's shooting requesting identification of a man caught on tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which was incompatible with life," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media via 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to moving around the scene, had a gun, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was wiped out without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
6 feet and 6 inches tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, 10 of which were last season, and the average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion’s title when the team directed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished his Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team director would play a big part in the race.
From the field position, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two corners he defended his position and challenged Vettel to attack the team's partner.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with cars circling the tail of the group, which should be crucial.
The Mercedes rider drove to the depot later and after the exit he was ranked behind Vettel. However Hamilton went forward and in a close fight the Ferrari driver had to reluctantly leave the inner runway free to defend himself in the third turn after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen set off from the rear row of the driving field and at the end of the first round he was in the lead on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race because he kept the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he drove to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer raise the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two jobs," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting for insisting that she hadn't published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the testimony given to Ford before the Senate Judicial Commission, instead he stated that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and repulsive and lying.”
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's been happening in Senar these last days, when you see the anger, when you see these people being angry and evil and disgusting and lying," he said.
“If you look at the release and publication and they say, "Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you responsible for the leak?
Remember her answer... did you post the document - oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't. "
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, we didn't," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and information leaked in early September – but Feinstein refused to let her office escape.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, nor did I disclose information about the case," said Klomis Feinstein, who informed The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, her words appear to be unbelievable to the president who commented on the case at the meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's definitely the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for a Supreme Court judge accused by three women of sexual harassment and indicated that the Democrats were using these charges for their own ends.
“They are determined to take back the power by any means available.
You see the depravity, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample into the country to get back to power and the helm," Mediaite quoted the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's rematch in Dundee, which ended at 5-3.
The Giants soon took the lead on the two-man lead through the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to make up for the landlord before Dwyer brought the Giants back to lead.
Francois Bouchard then straightened out for Dundee, then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the team Adam Keefe, who managed to beat 2-1 on Friday in Belfast Dundee.
Both teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous matches dominated by Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., under the assistance of Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford scored the assist on Beauvilleier's second goal four minutes later.
The first period was wild when Sullivan got the landlord back in the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquartt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared it at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first break in the lead after he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The landlords regrouped, and Bouchard managed to re-balancing the score from the power play at 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen, later in the second period, for the first time in the game, to take the lead on Dundee’s side, and the same player secured the leadership of his team in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic manager died to allow hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
The air traffic manager in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died while overseeing the flight with hundreds of people on board safely take off.
Over 800 people were killed, and many are missing after the great earthquake that caused the tsunami rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks flooded the area, and many remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Pal.
But even though colleagues of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in a wildly raving control tower at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought he was sliding down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for air traffic control, told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We've prepared a transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was taken to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for dealing with the disaster stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase because many bodies still remain unscathed under the wreck and many of them still have not been reached by rescuers," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesperson.
The waves in the devastated Palu reached a height of up to 20 feet [6 m]. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring assistance and supplies to the affected sites.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies in.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small stores are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already tragic, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military forces: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" said CNN Station.
Indonesia was hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
The plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that after the plane crash in the lagoon, one person is missing.
An airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the micronesian islands in the Pacific has now stated that one person is missing, indicating in the beginning that all passengers and crew of 47 have safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported in a press release that she was unable to find a traveling man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in search of a missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests to provide details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped in the rescue of other passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials claimed that a total of seven persons had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the treatment on Saturday and they were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had run over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that along with the others he managed to get deep water to the emergency exits of a sinking plane.
He also stated that the on-board staff panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who worked nearby to adjust the dock helped to rescue using an inflatable boat to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades a total of 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents, but no accident has occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution ended its speech on Saturday in this case, in which a man is repeatedly tried to burn a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett has been testifying for several hours and providing expert reports in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst sketched out the script he used on the cell phone of the 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was at Chambers's on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous statement, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data from the cell phone showed that he had spent the evening with Chambers, he noted that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford was court-martialed on Saturday, testifying that the day in question was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that “he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night. ”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
However, cell phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin their closing argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected to see the case before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative views on this genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed band from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved on from its early days with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have already seen a revival in the recent past thanks to such artists as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?
A New York governess sues a couple for her firing after a "racist" text message
The New York governess sues a couple for their discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong text message from the mother in which she was described as "another black woman" text message.
The couple refused to be racist and compared the lawsuit to "the blackmail."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when, on the first day of her work in 2016, she found out that the new governess of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
"NEEEÉÉÉÉ, OTHER MONETARY," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs Maurice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice and stated that her currently leaving governess, who was African-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting Filipino instead, said the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for compensation for being fired and asking for compensation of USD 350 per day of six-month engagement for which they were initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not done," the Post reported this Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the couple struck back with the fact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, because they feared that they could no longer trust her after the insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco, Post.
"But would you place your child in the hands of someone you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened a lawsuit to "extortion" and stated that his wife only cared for a child two months old and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Would you be riding someone like that?
That is not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Although the lawsuit still persists, the social media jury denounced the couple very quickly for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of stories about Paddington the bear feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, showing the latest news
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, told the rapporteur: “It is difficult to empathize with someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
But it's very funny to know now that we know the great success of Paddington the bear."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, she added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of a book that became a "sweet-bitten" dot after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of her family, ” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, never boastful," she said.
“But since Paddington was such a real figure for him, it was like you had a child who achieved something that you could really be proud of.
I believe he was looking at Paddington's success with that perspective.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his achievements only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that she did not expect to get out of it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, “Tash, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs given to her by the doctors to keep her heart running slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was shut down.
I just had to sit around and wait, and I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in myself."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers without showing what a difficult test she is going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head down, tears flowed down my cheeks all the time.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight that I felt an overwhelming understanding of Nado.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can look for support on.
Tyler's son, Mrs. Davis, was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and as a result, he took his own life when he was 18.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up every room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his sibling’s still body after taking his own life.
Davis says: “I am constantly worried about how this will affect his life. ”
Mrs Davis suggested postcards “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are friends.
Do not sit silent - you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is an old friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his behavior.
It was the worst thing on Christmas Eve - when the kids opened the presents and didn't look at them, nothing."
She said that her partner’s death was a huge trauma to them, but that they must gradually get over it: “This thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It ripped us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought we could get something he was actually asking for – an investigation in time of restriction, with limited scope – we could bring in a little unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "break apart" because both sides would bury themselves in conquered positions after partisanism.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away from us, November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to do badly, this will lead to a major weakening in their attempts to enforce their required man for office at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and through him met with his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI draws up their report?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm in the Supreme Court.
The numbers of refugees from North Korea have fallen for Kim.
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the start of Kim Jong-Un's government seven years ago, claims the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that there have been 1127 escapes in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that more stringent controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates required by smugglers at the border were behind this.
Pyongyang made no public statement.
Today, the vast majority of refugees from the North receive an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relations between North and South – which are still technically in a state of war – have improved markedly in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on halted denuclearization negotiations.
This was the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions for cooperation in nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Jong-ho, accused the US of making no progress on sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way for us to be unilaterally disarmed," Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that because of her temperament, she was unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if any woman had ever performed such a theatre, they would have called it “hysterical,” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday statement before the Senate Judicial Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still teenagers.
during his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and suffocating in dealing with his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats in committee and stated that their accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated attack” by liberals who failed to get past Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because she showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi answered negatively about whether she would have sought Kavanaugh's appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had acquired the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will tell you this - if he is not telling Congress the truth, then she is not only eligible for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court she is currently working on," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the potential returns of Kavanaugh in the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because she was considered a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reverse any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to just say, "Oh, my, it's beautiful," said Pelosi.
And women have to rule it.
After verbal attacks, months and years of resentment, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who was a principal somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued to do so.
And I think it's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from the first job I worked in an office where men dominated. I once expressed my inexpressible anger by crying. But the older, always cold manager, who I was always a little worried about, grabbed my neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illegitimate affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she told me laughing after 30 years.
“Seven other candidates have already run, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
But since the campaign had been running for a long time, she couldn't keep up with the donations, so she pledged not to go to the game unless she got $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does she think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, with frustration with a system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on the electorate rather than on delegates and anger over sexism, that she was completely suffocating with anger.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press reacted to her.
“And you might think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were gonna write on my headstone.
"Was she crying?"
Why Can the Chinese-American Trade War Be Good for Beijing
The initial salvo trade war between the US and China was deafening and, although the battle is far from being fought, according to experts between being a crack between countries in the long term beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, provided the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, saw the light of day this week, when new tariffs were announced on goods worth USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion), which basically means taxing half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of American goods.
China tried to repay the US with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy would kneel on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to get back on track, it would mean giving in to his demands, but public submission to American demands would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Jinping.
Even so, experts believe that if Beijing could play his cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
“The fact is that the rapid political decisions of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic corkscrew in both countries. This is far more dangerous than the observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, research associate, who focuses on Asia in the Think Tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, claims the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
At the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate terrorist-ravaged areas into normal condition.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives, are now met.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored insurgents.
Europe responded decisively to the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the USA team with a final score of 16,5 to 10.5 on the field of Le Golf National on the edge of trouble in France.
The US has now lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil, so it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
The star of the United States, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then blew the ball into the water at 3 par 16th hole and let Francesco Molinari win.
Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Top rated world player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who apparently completed his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia has become overall the best European player with 25,5 points earned in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy to get the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I am glad that I could help," said Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won the 14 greatest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend trying to find fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
After the unsatisfying results of his team, US captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of those boys, they really fought.
We really warmed Europe up this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could be their captain.
I really have to get out of here.
You played us."
Update on the red tide: Concentrations are reduced in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to the overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, flowering water stains are now reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts – this suggests a decreasing concentration.
The flowering red tide water ranges about 130 miles from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
Blurs were observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but last week it was already relatively fewer places.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, mean concentrations were reported off the coast or on the high seas at Pinellas County. Low to high concentrations, lowest to high concentrations in Manatee County, lowest to high concentrations in Sarasota County, lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, lowest to high concentrations off the coast or on the high seas at Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County were observed in Hillsborough County.
Respiratory irritations continue to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
