What will he do? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new city councillors from the ČSSD will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the council.
Journal Aktuálně.cz "Tested" members of the new Board of ČSSD, as they know the notoriously established slang, which was established at the City Hall during the last years when Prague's current coalition partners ruled.
The coded dictionary introduced by the Prague political elite during the previous era by Mayor Pavel Bém describes some of the most famous characters, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councillors do not understand well - known concepts.
That's what they're saying.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more of a rookie in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký responded to the test of the "Komotrovy" vocabulary of the town councillor for culture.
And as a political veteran, so did Councilman Karel Brezina.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you give me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I generally don't recognize slang."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz this June before the ODS election congress, the editors selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously linked to the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists should explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "the bull's neck", "the betrayal of the capital" and "creat".
The trio of councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head the school in Prague in the future - first promised the interview, but later he did not answer the phone.
Fifth Alderman Petr Dolínek refused the test straight away.
"I don't do these things at all, and I'm not going to judge how the citizens' democrats are having fun."
"I am now dealing with how we will understand each other in our programmes," he responded.
As has already been said, councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not have known in the headline above that it is a talk of an influential businessman and friend of expressor Bém Roman Janoušek.
The "Voldemort" to Kaucké tells him nothing, and the only term he correctly estimated in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, adding, "But I know that more from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
As the Blanka tunnel, the golf hole is decrypted not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachý is familiar with where to find this character - he knows the meaning of the word "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague company," is Shy close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
Consistent with Březina, he recalls that he drew knowledge from the newspaper rather than using such a dictionary.
In a social democracy, according to the spectators of the test, there is no similar common vocabulary of slang expressions.
"I've consulted my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call ourselves by names, sometimes acronyms and compounds of names are used," says the president of Prague's ČSSD Petr Hulínský, whose parties call Huld.
"At school they called me Bříža, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," he admits to his own nickname Karel Březina.
Journal Aktuálně.cz tried the name and works.
Alderman Weinert is for the party Dědek or less friendly Dědek, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the election fraud during party sponsorship, has the nickname "Igráček" in some colleagues.
Aliases are also the only thing the Social Democrats admit in intra-party language.
Hulínský says he does not like hearing Huldu, but the journal Aktuálně.cz also recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of baton law" is said to recall that Petr Hulínský won his degree as JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", published a brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common characters.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, cannot engage in work, for example, for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who "becomes a witch" is sent to isolation to avoid endangering the rest of the village.
"It's very rare for a man to have this fate."
"Neither young healthy women are moving away because they help with work and give birth to children," describes the order nurse who in the capital of the West African State Burkina Faso takes care of more than a hundred women in a special home who have been expelled from their ranks by their community.
The local government has now decided to take action against an unusual "social measure".
She published an information booklet that should help limit the witch hunt.
But there's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," said Die Standard.
Charges of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring with Burkina Faso, last week, 75 - year - old Ammy Hemmah died after being tortured by three women and two men, poured kerosene on and set on fire.
The BBC server reported the case.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was ignited by oil used for ritual anointing.
They said he was on fire after the group wanted to drive the evil spirit out of a woman.
People support the isolation of "witches" regardless of the level of education achieved.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the witch hunt is trying to moderate the government, in Gambia last year the president himself took part in it.
"Gambi President Jammí, after the death of his aunt, unleashed a large witch hunt, which allegedly should have contributed to her death and sought to kill the president himself using black magic."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers, as well as personal security of the president, violently took randomly selected men and women from Gambi villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in her report.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a potion from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakal's tenant: He's drowning in the stove, he's signed higher rent
The older stocked man stepped out of the door of the RPG client center Apartments "uhlobarona" Zdenek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it new lease contracts to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of punishment.
All three of them just got their rent up.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for the apartment 2+1 next year.
"And that's not hot water, and it's got to be a petrama," shows the man in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has the power of attorney.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease terms "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December to publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man is just waving his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year, most of the flats, which still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic, are waiting.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The rpg waiting room is one of four in Ostrava, and it's already full at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
Right next to the door is security detail from the security agency, and it's got a device on it.
"Hire 2011", the special button on its touch screen is lit.
One tap, and a numbered piece of paper comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your cipher is already beeping on the big screen below the waiting room ceiling.
You're up in half a second.
An older married couple comes to ask about the rent after a while, but apparently the rush in the waiting room has nothing to do with the new rents.
Most people came to deal with common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance events, etc.
Letters with new lease contracts are received by tenants of most of the 44,000 flats of the RPG portfolio in Ostrava from around mid-November.
RPG Flats suggests an increase in rent of 15 to 38 percent in letters.
A special counter for new rents was opened at the client center on 18 November.
"It's been going on over a week, so it's only in the process," the worker behind the counter responds after a while of hesitation when the client introduces herself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining flats are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, he was taken by the Vice-President of Parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and even now the local newspaper is full of him.
"For twenty years, I've been asking them for a new floor."
"They didn't even change the toilet board," said the man in the introduction.
Most of the workers say that seniors are coming to see if they can get a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as the RPG promises in the special offer.
Half discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The Havířská "deregulation" partition but the questions are certainly not overwhelmed.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, there were only about 40 to 50 people here for rent for 2011, "they estimate workers behind the counter.
At the same time, RPG designs individual contracts on the web and its walls where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about a possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," warns RPG on its website.
"There will be no trial here," thinks one of the RPG workers Flats and the man on the street outside the client center partially gives her the right.
"I have 13,000 pensions, and I have $5,000 left to eat, and I don't have what it takes to sue," he says.
After all, the worker will be in a state of disquiet.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
Rent regulation ends in the majority of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Flats their increase is an economic necessity.
"The remaining rent still does not reach even the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of RPG Byty's residential portfolio, that the very angry tenant accused of neglecting the housing fund, according to homeowners, is the main reason for the increase in rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest in flats four billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the waiting room repeats several red highlighted information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 flats, that is more than 90% of RPG flats."
"And it will always be at most 7.50 CZK per square metre and a month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 flats from the RPG portfolio will increase rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," warns RPG.
For 2,600 flats next year, the rent will remain the same.
RPG Apartments promises that deregulation will not drive out rents by jump, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see chart) will be put back into flats, mainly into thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
Preferably, they're to be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices include kindergarten, architects understood
The Avriopoint administration building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect him to hide a mini-school girl with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year she can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
Arch.Design, the design-architectonic company, whose studios produced a number of important Brno buildings, has been counting on the space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of babyboom, and she cared so that women designers and architects could return to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of abbreviated work, kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with child care.
Arch.Design employees invented the mini-school and managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs with the support of management.
The corporate mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant financing (subsidisation of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operation for two years.
After the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design has an obligation to operate a mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and with the request for a subsidy was significantly helped by Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the children are looked after daily by the nurse and teacher of the school, so children can attend kindergarten without age limit, yet most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "minimum school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more can be replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme is comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic recognition to preparation to school benches, the English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their children at any time, and stress situations with delayed picking up children from preschools away from their parents ’ workplaces are falling away.
Thus, parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal relationship between an employee and an employer.
Arch.Design thus joined Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones fascinates after 100 years. Check the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the Casa Batlló house in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house has earned its nickname House of Bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all of which are typical of Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The façade of the house plays dream lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
The detailed observation shows geometry, rhythm, and precise order.
At night, the whole facade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is lit so that the impression of the gloss of the colors is enhanced.
The winding and twisting of shapes appear equally in interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, eyes and rails.
The Batlló House, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43, was rebuilt in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one, soon accepted Gaudí's idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the apartment house Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade were created on his design board.
Many other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on Casa Batlló's designs started with successful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Park Güell, where there are other Gaudí's works.
From the locals, the house soon after its completion was earned thanks to its organic shapes the nickname "House of Bones".
Others began to call it a "deep house" because of a specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs include other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys for his time.
Bizarre may seem to be their 45 - degree inclination.
In the creation of Gaudí, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of that time and did not allow them to bind him.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the figures about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when finishing, the city council was destroyed and asked for correction.
The councillors, for example, resented the fact that the construction also interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, only 15 days after the challenge of the city district, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to lower floors.
The gallery on the second floor was a social salon and on the third floor a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The whole six-story house crosses the staircase, which can be climbed to the roof terrace itself.
The fundamental elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and the larger society can communicate comfortably without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudí's reconstruction also gained unusual roofing and two additional floors in addition to the new facade.
Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which is lined with inner courtyard, and skylights, is also impressive.
The game of two colors gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
Casa Batlló, which was placed in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and luxurious apartment made available to the public.
The owners decided on this step only in 2002, on the occasion of celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed at the tours because they found that it was a very advantageous business and, moreover, they extended the tours with common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is EUR 16.50 and students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have a 20% discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you must quickly become friends with one of the residents and visit it directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate: Women have different requirements than men
Not a fancy bed frame, but the quality of the flooring area, i.e. the mattress and grate, give the foundation of a really good bed.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented to suit a particular user.
Many things, from weight, height, age, state of health and gender of the owner, decide when choosing.
The type of interior into which mattresses and grates are taken is also important.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages where they do not heat regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they are slower "heated".
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
In doing so, it is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid board, they're holding the humidity: mold could even appear under them.
The custom also decides when choosing.
Who has spent longer time abroad, where they often use a very high mattress with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel comfortable on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"For their battered shoulders, heel and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misrepresent "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
For many hockey players, but also for other customers years ago she was looking for a mattress with lazy foam.
"Today it's okay, suitable mattresses have Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be the NHL guy to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracles" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
There's nothing pushing you, you won't turn around at night like you did after a tough game.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
Lazy foam also works as protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, so 180 cm in total.
For single beds, such as singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when laying on your back you should have hands comfortably slightly bent in your elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the headmaster of the Cechu upholstery and decorators, who has been devoted to the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures at vocational schools.
With double beds, each needs its own grate and mattress, but watch your purchase to match the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left to do but install grates in different heights, but you may not succeed at each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, types with a spring frame of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres should be counted on the forming and rolling layer.
"When you touch your hands or touch the mattress, you must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Full beds where mattresses and bedrocks are like twin siamese twines have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are bad ventilation, they cannot be washed, which is common today.
And since we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress begins to resemble one large (and blocked) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses for up to 25 years or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its own buts.
Therefore, advice from dealers from practice: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up the washable coating, but rather add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Even though mattress covers are commonly made today with slides all over the circuit, so that after opening we get two parts (very important for washing and washing size!), still handling in larger types (and in one person) while shooting could resemble a light weight match in the ring with a heavy one.
Do you have a hard plate in your bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum bed for one night visits.
However, touch the plate (if it no longer has it) with ventilation holes and use a spring frame mattress with a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it. Taschenfedern) and a fluctuating layer.
The polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a base.
A latex or sandwich mattress (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-positioning lamellar grates with 14 to 18 lamellas, but you will always pay off for more lamellas, 28 or more, where the lamellas in the lumbar area are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
A mattress with a spring frame does not belong on the positioning grids, because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to setting the rigidity of the lamellas, you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of lamellas, which allows you to push or even tilt the lamella so that the shoulder sleeps nicely "deep".
For men who have "arms over their backs", it's definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers who started using the softening zone in the area of the shoulders in "gentlemen".
Women also remember - they are given a softer surface in hip places.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate grates with so-called multitorsion suspension.
Pressure decomposes into more points and reduces voltage.
However, be careful, once you use the wrong pillow (big and "sucky") on the right mattress and grate, most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and tip only to reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
50 x 60 cm is recommended as a suitable size, which they prefer in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance the height of the shoulder (with the shoulder cradle of the grate or softened zone in the mattress) of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with original straws filled with grass.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is just organic for mattresses.
Oil raw materials from which polyurethane foam is produced are replaced by natural oils, such as e.g. from a slipper and soya.
It's soy that all known manufacturers use.
"Bio at mattresses means that the core is made of purely natural material," explains Petr Vasíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules to release fresh scents of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men "cool" birch plant extract to absorb heat and cool the body, women "heat" covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (with larger pores with broken cell structure, is thus more breathable than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining various rigid cold foams and "lazy" foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, shoulders and heel should be.
You will pay for a quality mattress from about 7,000 crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters have a lower VAT rate are considered as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first to reach this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving money for a mattress and a grate isn't easy.
Sometimes it is possible to take advantage of the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattress with memory foam sewn into the cover for CZK 11,990.
The second can be bought for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foam with open cell structure and high density started Tempur material.
It was originally created as NASA material because at launch, astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
Tempur in the heat is soft, in the cold it is firming.
It thus perfectly adapts to the warm human body and decomposes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedsores, but also to increase comfort while sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which relieve the foot and venous system.
Domestic producers use, for example, Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver foam and so on.
People watching machines want more and more parents, so they want to keep their children safe.
Fear for their own child brings more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system originally designed for the search for cars can also track the movement of people and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of 9-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it can only be the size of a watch.
A lot of people got scared of the missing Anička case and started looking for means to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices may be misused, such as when they are put in a bag to someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the box and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like this, she'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose things when they don't want to be controlled."
"Great expectations had previously been triggered by mobile phones in parents, but they can be turned off just like these tracking devices," Bočková said.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such equipment would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the kidnapping is concerned, the perpetrator will virtually always ensure that the child has no electronics on him that might reveal his location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will be looking for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that a similar device may help in the event of an emergency attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech, from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if there is immediate destruction of the tracking device after the attack, its presence can help.
"The device can be set for regular positioning after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The other devices have built-in tiltometers, so even if one slips and stays still, the device will send a warning immediately with a positioning," says Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service can be taken by smart mobile phones with navigation, where you can also upload special software.
The problem with current surveillance units is that they are either devices similar to matchbox size pendants or smaller mobile phones.
It's always a threat to their loss.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why the device now looks like a normal digital watch.
"It will have the greatest advantage that a possible aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he won't recognize them until after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology that is used for car-sitting.
It is a combination of GPS tracking (which uses common self-navigation) and mobile phone functions that report the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would wrap the Czech Republic.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of cords to detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometers of cords to the warehouses.
The army has a supply for 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the cords is two or four years, tops.
The army bought incendiary cords from the STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
The general staff wrote back in order to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of incendiary lines MF DNES that soldiers use 60 kilometers of fuses a year in training.
However, it follows from the calculations of military pyrotechnics, which were addressed by MF DNES, that all generals, officers in command of the army, secretary or cleaning woman would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Minister of Defense Alexander Vondra and military commander Vlastimil Pick, including.
It's the only way to justify an army's annual consumption of 60 kilometers of firecrackers.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, military supplies would be enough for more than ten years.
On the other hand, if it were true that two metres of incendiary cord, as experts say, is enough to train every new professional, the military has provided fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of engineering or special units - of supplies for the said 225 years.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to Minister Vondrovi personally that they had almost no ammunition for handguns, so shootings are also limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I can't help but wonder that they're buying so many matches from us over and over again."
"But it's their decision, and I'm sure they know what it's for."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we are trying to accommodate as traders," says the sales manager of the STV Group, Jan Děcý.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometres of purchased line, even that the army will have supplies of this "municipal" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, only talks about the four-year life of the incendiary and police or military pyrotechnics even about two years.
"With the perfect storage, it could be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish a name because of the military's criticism.
After the end of life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a quantitative discount of 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"We got 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," says Pejšek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence's buyers.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of police pyrotechnics firing lines, which dispose of ammunition from World War II or after the Soviet army, has not been more than 1,500 metres.
And the police order only enough to use this ammunition before the end of life.
It has proved to her for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also gain more flexibility in gaining more modern and therefore more reliable types of lines.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable problems with the destruction of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the 2000-thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing for the campaign on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnics, addressed by MF DNES, is facing the same problem in a few years: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old incendiaries, which today "cheap" buys.
To this day, I draw from the contacts that I got thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Živnostník of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in selling the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's competition Živnostník of the year was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using bank credit he bought a semi-drained house with five apartments.
That was a lot of courage for him to be a third year student back then.
"The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation with us at the time did not allow me to try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to rent to foreign workers.
All the profit invested back into the house, which gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has gradually managed to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently a four-star Baggins design hotel.
This year, however, he added another, of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov near Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties about the franchise of hotels Pytloun is reporting," says last year's tradesman number one.
"And in this sale of the license to operate the hotel, it was precisely the victory in the Trader of the Year competition," Pytloun said.
The victory brought him more familiarity and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me even more, and I must say it was pleasant," he recalls.
It certainly recommends participation in the competition to all who are trying to do something.
There's no need to win, any visibility is good.
He says that he still draws on contacts and connections that he may not even otherwise reach.
"Some of the people I've met since the competition, I've started to do business regularly."
The fame associated with success, according to him, fell a little on every employee.
And he's got, like, 70s.
"I see more loyalty and pride in their involvement in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is placed in the foreground," says Luke Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
However, Farmet has had worse times because of the winner’s determination.
Last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, came for the prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Competition.
The jury appreciated the effort, through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers from a small tool shop in Česká Skalica.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my coworkers and increased our confidence in the competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered the father of Karel Žďárský a small workshop to rent as compensation for Communist seized property, he did not hesitate long, refused his career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father founded a company on plastic baths.
Soon afterward, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Even among the unprofessional public, the company got more awareness after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to perceive Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate their cooperation with a company that achieved greater success in its country," says Karel Žďárský.
The past year, however, was not just in Farmet as a sign of euphoria from the triumphs.
The award was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the hardest year for the sale of engineering goods.
It culminated in a crisis that had not yet affected citizens, but companies had already stopped their investment projects and began to restrict the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"Of course, this situation has not been avoided by us either."
"The market has fallen by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and we have had to layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company has to be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, even if less than before the crisis.
But what Farmet did not reduce is investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from subsidies, strengthened the presentation at international trade fairs, won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is over.
Sales are growing again and so are the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A Survey to Eliminate Senseless Regulations
The report on the Absurdity of the Year is the fourth part of the business competition.
Some senseless regulations have already been abolished.
The infamous winner of the next Absurdita of the Year poll was the obligation to carry documents which are also accessible online to officials.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voters have decided.
For example, social security management required a paper statement from the Commercial Register, even if the official can get it by two clicks of the mouse.
The poll's gonna change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a statement from the Commercial Register for checks on insurance payers," said the spokesperson for ČSSZ Jana Burananová.
To shine a light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and to cancel them is the purpose of the Absurdita of the Year competition.
This is the fourth part of the business competition organized by Hospodářské noviny and is increasingly popular among the public.
Last year, if some 3,000 people voted, there were nearly 4,000 of them.
And no wonder, the various legal obligations that only serve to delay business are still enough and enough.
"We are at the top of the world in the number of tax returns," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, the simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments.
However, the situation is not particularly improving in the Czech Republic compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed 74th position in terms of conditions for business, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdita of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can sign up for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the deadline for the competition is.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used to log in.The organizer will then select seven candidates for the "anticene" and will have the public voting on it over the Internet during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations lacking meaning, have been entered into this year's poll.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition there was, for example, a requirement for motorways and expressway maintenance vehicles to pay tolls, or for businessmen with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven designs is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which takes place always at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning which regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted this year.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws sticks at entrepreneurs, which is why I aim to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which make business more difficult today," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break down pointless regulations doesn't sound empty.
In 2007 people were most upset by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office at the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by the amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report the employment office for its foreign employee on a business trip for up to 30 days, was removed by the Green Card Act.
And third time's the charm.
The absurdity of 2009 became the regulation of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two extra weights in the office.
This was eased this year by the decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
New in this year's fifth edition of Hospodářské noviny competitions is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a sensible and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the event of a rebel contest of the year.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of 2010 has signed up companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish on a separate article.
Although the object of their activities differs diametrically from each other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, for example, it concerns disabled people and others, such as personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports, found herself among the 14 national finalists.
Another example of the responsible company from the Pardubice Region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the fund sponsoring handicapped children for 17 years.
The paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent, takes care of its disabled employees and therefore won the title Responsible company of the Central Bohemia Region and in the Vodafone Competition, the Company of the Year was the third in the region.
The company MiRyz Soft won Olomouc, which introduced flexible working hours, even lowered to an average 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The title was awarded by the jury for buying from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration can have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region is thinking about the health of its employees and for each laptop it has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the company Praní and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to its employees in the form of premium bonuses for their pension insurance.
"In our country we give contributions to food, transport, improvement of qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Competition of the Year were automatically entered into the category Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizers by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrectly completed or incomplete questionnaire replies were then removed from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to enter this competition alone, because it is a sub-category of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose organizing agency.
Police arrested the Land Fund in Pilsen during a public tender
Anti-corruption police have been arresting the Land Fund building in Pilsen in recent days.
Detectives put the handcuffs on a local businessman in the media sector and a realtor Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public tender to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would obtain specific candidates.
Luboš G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for it.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police prosecute one person for misdemeanors in public procurement and public competition," said the Attorney General of Pilsen, Antonia Zelená, who said that further details cannot be provided with regard to the ongoing investigation.
Forty-six-year-old businessman, police officers released after 24 hours.
In view of the minimum of official information, there is only speculation as to how he could have influenced the competition.
Speaker of the Lubomír Černá Land Fund on the question Rights said that police officers actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to Černá, the public competition has the correct name "Call for the submission of land transfer rights under the Land Act" and takes place when more eligible applicants are interested in the offered land.
"These persons, in the context of the call, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the rights offered, the order of the purchasers is determined and the Land Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest claims," the spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. probably had information about who entered the call, and since he is also a legitimate person, since he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered to the interested party that he would not participate in the competition.
He probably paid severance payments for that.
That would explain that he had such a large amount of money in custody.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts to the PF in Pilsen in the past.
He worked in case of former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in a replacement restitution, on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access road was to be built to the industrial zone of Borská Fields.
Later it was very advantageously traded with the Magistrate for a house in the historic centre of the city itself, which was worth much more.
At the time, the town hall had to accept it, because otherwise, blocking the land would put the building at risk.
Housing households will pay hundreds a month
Households will have to pay extra for all kinds of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heat supplies and rents will increase from January onwards.
Families will have to pull up hundreds more crowns a month from January than they do now.
Electricity will increase by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay extra for supplies of water and will often subside the supply of central heat.
Electricity generation should cost households a hundred crowns a year more than it is now.
The prices of power electricity have been reduced by all major suppliers, so there is a significant increase in support of the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
The gas will increase slightly, but at a time when people are drowning the most and have the highest consumption.
They must therefore also count on hundreds of extra crowns each year.
While electricity and gas will increase across the country, the change in central heating prices is different from that of the country.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about CZK 50 extra per month for central heating from January onwards, more than CZK 1000 per year for families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague are at risk of increasing their rent from infrastructure by more than 9 percent of their water and sewerage costs.
If the rent doesn't change, they'll pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be in the national comparison between the lower ones.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it is supposed to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices in 450 thousand rental apartments, where regulation has ended since January, can significantly increase.
For example, CPI Flats, which owns about 2500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase rents by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who don't agree to the new rent rate, he's going to put the company on trial.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300,000 flats could increase by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, an exceptionally better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that most often end up in the care of doctors by drunkards who were not even 15 years old.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from the monkey in the hospital.
This is apparent from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the incomes of children’s wards of hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Trendem is definitely a hard drink," said Mr.Pelikán, the Chief of Children's Department of Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"If they can pull a bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's whiskey, but it's the fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into their juice and not feeling so much," explained the chief.
And for the truth, the spokesperson for Motol University Hospital Eva Jurinová also gives him the right answer.
"It's most often fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice brought from home," Jurinová said.
According to Chief Pelican, 13 or 14 - year - old drinkers in hospital intake are a relatively common phenomenon.
In front of Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked at pediatrics in Motol for ten years, where ambulances carry subjugated schoolchildren from around.
"There was a girl in my house about four times."
"She started her career when she was 12 years old, when she was brought to us with 3.5 extra alcohol in her blood, combined with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the fairground in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief surprised.
It is the parents who do not care, or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring, that is to say, the main cause of growing child drinking.
However, according to experts, addiction in the true sense cannot be discussed in children.
"The term alcoholic refers to several years of chronic addiction to alcohol with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that is not in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more typical of a failed family-social background," explained Chief Pelikán.
According to Jurinová, roughly 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motole by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children's drunks, who take their parents after outpatient treatment, or the police bring them home, do not count.
Except when children sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, according to Pelican, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: witch, New Year’s Eve, and the end of the school year.
"They either drink grief from a bad report card, or they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course, I have experienced seven children's drunkards at the same time," said Pelikán.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at the advantage of the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will prevent the irrigation infusion with glucose and nutrients missing from the body.
"They're actually better off because they have a good evening's experience and a good awakening, and nothing hurts them."
"They are only confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, saying that he sometimes spoils the patient's pleasant mood by at least the cost of their treatment.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a means of education, when I was directly calculating on the kids' rounds how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to earn for that one party," Pelikán added.
According to him, however, health insurance companies do not accept regression procedures in which parents would recover the cost of treatment, in the case of children’s drunkards.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Sevilla, Spain, where the manufacturer Casa - EADS is based on Tuesday.
It is the first time machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they've only been abroad on exercise or demonstration flights.
It is a two-digit version of L-159T1 which has been operated by the Czech army and which have been able to fly.
The remaining three machines are single-digit L-159.
They are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and a business broker - Omnipol company - took over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek from the Defence Press Department, it is not yet known when the aircraft are physically dispatched from Vodochod.
"One-digit L-159 aeroplanes for the shift have been set aside from long-term stored aeroplanes, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry Department."
"The two-digit L-159T1s were changed in the current state and form," he said to the Law of Pejšek.
He added that the army would not remain without two-digit aircraft, because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth CZK 200 million to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-digit machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS has committed to deploying aircraft into the armaments of an alliance country.
"It is clearly stated in the contract that the customer of L-159 aircraft is EADS and will serve to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter of the customer how he will implement this matter," Pejšek said.
Hospodarske noviny stated some time ago that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
In exchange for five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three additional aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not put out a tender for the purchase and addressed the EADS directly.
Back then, defense management argued that it would support future exports of L-159 abroad in exchange.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aer and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
Buying Casa planes will probably have a court case.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it should have chosen aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at the Prague airport of Kbely within a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger indicates lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than a ring finger are at less risk of becoming ill with prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Magazine.
Could be related to the levels of male testosterone hormone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under 60," said Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burdens, added Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and over three thousand healthy men followed with colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the study participants had a index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring finger.
They had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those who had an index finger longer than a ring finger, the risk decreased by 33 percent, even 87 percent for men under the age of 60.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - seems to reflect the various levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone matches the longer index finger.
Early research has shown that testosterone is supporting growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes told the Czech Press Agency that he knew about this study, but he does not seem to believe that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "fully proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and pedestrians lie mostly drifted snow, roadmen in many places drove all night long.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89th and 93th kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of freight and passenger cars and also stands at D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was told by dispatcher of the Central Motor Club (ÚAMK).
There was a truck crash at 1 9 miles, two trucks hit at 1 9 miles, an accident sustained injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 kilometres in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno at 190 km or drive through Brno and then drive at 182 km on Kývalka.
They're forming a multi-mile column.
Also on the D11 motorway there is an accident, right at the arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a multicentimeter layer of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are formed on Prosek, which is also blocked by Štěrboholská.
The surest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Náměstí Míru.
At 8:00 a.m., the Prague crisis crew is scheduled to re-assemble.
Railways and airports also face problems.
České dráhy already had to cancel seven express trains due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already mobile, but only with caution.
In Vyškovsko there are three impassable side roads, in Brno there are snow tongues and in Blansko there are necessary snow chains to overcome some roads in the above places.
The most affected areas were Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed paths: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
The cutters will need to be put into their stretching.
We can't estimate when they'll be bypassed.
Caution should be exercised in the area of White Carpathians in Hodoninsk.
On roads that are only kept there for nature conservation by inert sprinklers, there is up to five centimetres of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimetres of snow fell, the most falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowing in the Czech Republic gradually ceases.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only as XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a small super-accurate cannon.
Its projectiles guide the laser to a range of meters.
Special .25mm caliber bullets, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, effectively operate as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic pathway.
So they can be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, and if the murderous rain of steel shrapnel falls on it, it can take it out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry using "smart" technology.
"In principle, the soldier treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, thus obtaining a specified point of intent, adjusting the scale and pressing the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon will charge and detonate the missile at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," said Audette.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their job in July next year from the current office building to Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Fujitsu Group of Japan will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field specialized in computers and their maintenance said on Wednesday, in July next year 400 men and women will move their jobs from the existing office building to Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyon Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to Fujist’s spokesman, another 100 of the group’s jobs, which are still divided in the region, should be moved there in the near future.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and large space offices in Astro Park are more suited to the working manner of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
A competent executive named Bernd Wagner said, "we found a central seat in Frankfurt-Niederrad with excellent infrastructure".
An excellent airport connection is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important business within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointments to the losers yesterday.
Head of Economic Officer in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this managed to win the "global players".
It's said to be a fantastic expression of confidence in this location.
Fujitsu is supposed to suit the city, settling in is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi, regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was reportedly informed in time by the management of the company of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
But friendly contacts could not change the problems of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property to Marienbader-square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding the long unoccupied in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The Rathaus-square house, which until now used Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale", together with the other buildings on Marienbader-square were among the most discussed building intentions of the spa town.
Between the railway station and the town hall, a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called city street was created, which was criticized both for the massive construction of areas that had previously served as a parking lot and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001, Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer who was still connected to Siemens, moved into the homes.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chanten-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and were sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid after a year.
The Fujitsu-Concern of Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but the most employees of Fujitsu is in Munich.
From Bad Homburg is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions, the other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square metres were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the complex - its name draws attention to a stellar ground plan, which is twenty years old, is also located among others the central association of the electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon’s Internet service has shut down the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened on political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now searching for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol's watch list, is to be held by one newspaper post in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free", the activists announced by Twitter's short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Amazon withdrew Wikileaks documents from its servers shortly before.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic dispatches to handle a large number of access to documents.
Using Twitter, he explained Wikileaks to this step: "Okay - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "then they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its Wikileaks servers after Senator Joe Lieberman’s coworkers conducted a search, and released CNN TV stations based on information from Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to have taken this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks", said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called on other countries to avoid a platform in the use of servers.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, indecently and recklessly, and thus our national security is at risk and thus endangers life on the entire planet", said a statement by an impartial senator.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks expand stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol watch list.
Based on a report in London's newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The Internet activist has always referred to investigations in Sweden as intrigues of his opponents.
Speaker Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"Even there were calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is right to fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the person responsible for the Wikileaks publication be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an advisor to the government manager Stephen Harper said on TV - probably ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use "target aircraft".
Meanwhile, there was a verbal shootout between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "stupid and absurd" that Assange demanded Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's resignation if she was responsible for recently published intelligence calls for diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now examining extensively the security of its data banks.
The Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Center, Russell Travers, has been appointed as Special Instructor to the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure", which are necessary after the publication of news from the Embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger for publication on Wikileaks.
"We have taken everything we can to get in touch with them," said spokesperson for the State Department Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice cream university
The "Gelato University" at Bologna is preparing ice cream cookies for a better season.
The basic course for future ice creammakers, which lasts for three days, is of great interest and visitors arrive from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream coming from, anyway?
Gelatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech a bit obsolete ice cream maker, produces cream according to all rules of Italian ice cream artist.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooler, wipes it in the wafer and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But those who want to know more about ice cream will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, he set up an ice cream machine manufacturer at an ice cream university in order to match the high Italian ideals of ice cream from his machines.
The basic course for the future of Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors arriving from all over the world.
However, special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in our own ice cream factory are also available for several days.
Some in their Midlife-Crisis yearning for a new career, others dare on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream factory in Kairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste but also silky softness and good consistency that is decisive.
Luciano will not forget the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a great deal of romance."
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then cools it to four degrees.
Then he turns on the machine with a tap and flows pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the professor is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilizers - mostly natural products such as guar flour from guar seeds.
Of course it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it collides and the customer eats ice grains.
Certain variations of basic matter are allowed.
It'll be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the taste of ice cream and the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"Contributors will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbettes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with white-based ice cream that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa into a base for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now the participating course for ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnut.
The most popular kiwi ice cream produces a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture enhances the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach purée with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
You need extra sugar for lemon ice cream.
Luciano removes the apparatus by which it determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winegrowers measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Ice cream production no longer requires as much physical exertion as it used to be.
It does not only help the machine for automatic production of basic matter.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream into the cream at the same time and cools to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo soils himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when he gets out of control with a huge blender.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in Double Light
The European Food Authority, Ephsa, is linked to an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts from Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the estimation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," said Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, on Wednesday in Munich.
Leader of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genologically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another expert on Efsa have had a contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for several years.
It is financed by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated decisively in the control regulations of Ephsa for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
The rules of Ephsa are said to be consistent with the Ilsi documents and thus bear the manuscript of the industry, which should be checked by the office in Parma, Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, the high executive from Ephsa went without additions or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed EU-office personnel links for control with the industrial lobby, which has aroused interest both in the Environment Ministry and EU Members.
Meanwhile, Ephsa can't identify a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for Ephsa are not required to have contact with industry.
But they have to be documented.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It itself is referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a contract by lobbyists.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental effects is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what the genetically modified corn in the field will do," says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not prove reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, then how could they be found?", Then asks.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
A scientist has been researching gennics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University in Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is now attempting to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
That's why there's almost no scientists who aren't connected to corporations anymore.
Most studies that are critical to society are not published.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Stone Track
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing outside a train station in Stuttgart, a tuba on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the diggers arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar train stop.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken to 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft coarse stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It melts down: "The cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When he cut one, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former French Army ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were made during the car crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they broke into gravel or disappeared into a depot," he says in his office, a wooden box that used to be a watch house.
He reports that he was called names and threatened when in September all the newspapers said he bought the remains of the northern wing from a company that was doing demolition.
But he's been talking to S-21's opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he wasn't responsible for the demolition.
And when that happens, it's the most reasonable thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21-adversaries each about 80 kilos of heavy block, price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it during re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 big trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all over the place and dragged what fit into the trunk and onto the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long since turned into "backs" or like the edges of herb beds.
"This stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political entanglement."
He gets in his off-road car and rides his 20-haul kingdom.
He studied law first, stopped studying, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And a stone lover.
It's got 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow lies artistic sandstones.
"They once belonged to Marien Bridge in Dresden", he relates.
Sandman from the Elbe, yellow, gay, he's excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're on our way up through the woods.
It points to a pile: a red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
One time, those blocks belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be manually broken and transported using simple pulleys and bull carts, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were crushed."
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people and, in addition, a stonemason, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the leftovers.
He has to go to Cologne anytime soon.
That's where the rocks will be saved.
Talent Fight for High-potentials
There's a lot of people at the diner.
16 students press on salmon sandwiches, tomato soups and sweets.
The University of Technology in Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students of engineering and design to the workshop.
Together with VW developers, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW company, to succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible recruit the most talented graduates in the auditorium before they get to the labour market and are interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of the success of their students, companies try to discover and acquire exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the car group is trying to get talent the next day.
One young lady in the personal department is handing out pens, gummy bears and VW logo plates.
It tells promising young talents about training programs, student jobs, and suggests that they travel to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see advantages for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be useful as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is, they're so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh alumni will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to select their employees from long crowds of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract particularly highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates of engineering have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German Engineers VDI in October, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called lack of engineers will increase.
Roman Dykta goes to the auditing and consulting firm KPMG for talent hunting.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the US next year.
Participants can also see KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
In advance, it will decide in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested parties will fly to the USA.
Under Dykta, high potentials in colleges will be subject to increasingly harsh laws.
"We want to separate ourselves from others with our Race."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like the Talent Hunter Dykta is lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants in a similar event last year."
"Some will soon finish their studies and plan to apply for a job with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically in the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at expert exhibitions."
"Like Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, head of HR department of Solarworld.
Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
There are currently 35 posts listed on the company's website.
"At present, it's difficult to occupy vacant seats."
"It's worth a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact with professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as Freiberg University.
"Professors inform that it is possible to do practice or write a thesis in our country."
Solar specialist doesn't have any expensive promotions.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Big Groups often can't offer it," says Stübe, head of the personal department.
Money no longer plays a major role in finding a job.
Flexible working time, child care or good practice options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld took 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study at Great Place to Work.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, he asks his colleagues how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and follows the framework conditions of employees.
The head of Stübe's personal department hopes that the placement will bring her points for job seekers.
"I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about external assessments of the potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Emloyer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of a good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, that means, above all, internal action.
"The best way to make himself visible as an attractive employer is through his own employees," he says.
It is technically called internal Employer Branding, i.e. promoting an employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfactory employees are the best ambassadors."
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will themselves advertise to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game," says Kriegler.
Obama's stopping new oil wells
Over the coming years, new oil wells will not emerge outside the coast of the US-college state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued an appropriate ban, thereby finally abolishing previous plans.
Also outside the Atlantic coast, new wells are banned so far.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost 11 employees their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new wells in the East Gulf of Mexico to be pushed by opposition and industry.
Supporters are trying to reduce the US’s dependence on supplies of oil from abroad.
To date, there is no clear explanation as to who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the bay.
The center of criticism is the British energetic group BP, which is confronted with billion-dollar requests.
Obama’s commission of inquiry should present the results during December.
In October, the Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban that has been in effect since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies applied for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster through stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the audit authority is fundamentally reforming itself, drawing attention to many corruption accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil produced in the bay.
"Government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industry", is the result of an up-to-date survey in the field by consulting company BDO - before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance complains about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what will change by regulation."
Investments in new mining projects are being shifted until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People make a living stealing, corrupting, and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry", calms down the journalist environmental activist: "Today you'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who wade over the breasts with water that surrounds the smudges: the scene is almost nice in water gloss with rainbow colors.
You can't see that there are brown oil clots floating beneath the surface.
Previously there she collected enough garnel in the jars, tells Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetta river.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, large amounts of oil were poured out of a broken line into a huge, warm area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst infested areas in the world.
Along the river through mangrove swamps with lots of side tributaries, the whole range of the trigger is still noticeable.
The boat engine boils brown mash instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand into the water pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black liquorice sticks, rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves sad to hang.
In vain, we search for flocks of birds that are commonly found in damp areas: As soon as the engine on the boat dies down, it turns into an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a scary silence.
"What's happening here is environmental warfare," says the sad Celestine Akpobari, "We live in constant fear for health."
A comparison with war is justified.
Ogoni's settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe came here, where in the 1980s the first resistance was formed with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
To date, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the company mines daily from the entire delta area of three-size Switzerland with more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of lead of more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni fallow region lie too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters, steel structures like bizarre statues of "Christmas Trees" rise from the water, so they are called the heads of drilling holes too tenderly.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusted to the core.
Every now and then, the head of the drilling hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then flows a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion gallons of oil flowed into the delta in 50 years: every year as much oil flowed into the sea near Alaska in the crash of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes as to who is responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While Shell Group calls sabotage and organised oil theft more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmental protectionists refer to crackling drilling heads and leaky lines as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, accused the group in 2008 by US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only a number of failures on the lines are said to be "a few times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-soaked workshop in the open sky, it emerges from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to their necks from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by the guidance, partly freely scattered around the ground, burning fire: an illegal small refinery.
Oil warms up in a barrel over fire for several hours, explains Michael, group leader.
First, gasoline flows out of the lead into the trap pot, later drips at the end of the kerosin line and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four coworkers produce up to four barrels of 300 litres a day: "We'll make about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents use chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria only owns one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of oil can still be exceeded by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from the "bunkers" who connect to the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: experts say that at least 16 million gallons of oil are lost to the country every day in the entire Niger Delta region.
But only a negligible small part of the temporary stockpiled raw materials will be illegally refined: The largest share will be filled by organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military leaders, into tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate as to whether the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax method of production have caused a disaster is considered purely academic by the Akpobari activist.
"If oil companies weren't considered an intruder, and if they hadn't destroyed the life of fishermen so perfectly, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
But in the meantime, Ogoni's relationship to Shell is so damaged that only the exit of the group is considered: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will show up as better."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"The highest time for you to disappear", says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come at any moment."
If a special military unit finds them, they're not going to jail, they're going to have a painful bribe.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has taken our country to the bottom in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous building flaw in the A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major security malfunction.
Investigators discovered a possible building error during the search of the machine that landed in an emergency, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus were probably more fortunate in the early November landing than was known: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety defect in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns against a possible building error.
Perhaps a defect would have severe consequences: a single oil connection could cause cracks due to wear, this Thursday, in a published statement by ATSB.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It has lodged a statement of reasons for the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal measures against that company.
Chief of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and they damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce described burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out additional security tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
Security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said spokesperson ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough for all concerned to be informed.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its fleet A380 on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a security measure.
A two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall will create chaos in transport
Germany was all white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
There's chaos on many roads, trains and planes are jammed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the whole Republic fell in on Thursday night at freezing temperatures with snow - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, up to 15 centimeters of snow lies in some places.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely limited.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still on its way, but it could not handle the fresh snow.
In addition, there was a strong shock wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy flood on the Baltic Sea coast in Schlesvik-Holstein in the morning with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal.
Snow wills caused considerable problems in Saxony on motorways and state roads.
According to the bad weather control, the Meteorium was therefore the level of the purple alarm in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Partly, 30 centimetres of new snow fell there, strong and fresh winds caused wills.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major road problems.
On A2 caused wind and snow slow traffic and traffic jams.
There was trouble in Thuringia because of the snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, broken trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
Remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
In Duryn Saalfeld had to stop an ICE in Munich.
165 passengers on the train received wool blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescuers.
The snow winds are blowing across the road.
Many flights were cancelled due to snow winds at large German airports.
According to the spokesperson of the Flight Information Centre, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
According to Fraport's spokesperson, 40 flights have been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
There are few passengers left at the airport without a connection, but 400 field beds are ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in East Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road there was a similar accident near Nuremberg: also there was a truck caught on the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until morning hours.
And a 30 - year - old woman died after turning over on a slippery road at Aschaffenburg with her car.
But the weathermen have good news: snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will rise even in light gusts of wind.
But the wind is getting weaker.
Only at the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds of wind.
But it's going to be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in Frankfurt's headquarters.
The property could yield up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its group headquarters: the towers-twins in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now, apparently, the financial group wants the renovation costs back - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, as it informs "Financial Times Deutschland" with an appeal to the spokesman.
The speaker didn't name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell real estate and then rent it again," he said.
In this way, the largest credit institution in Germany once again gives up its company headquarters after a short time.
The bank only took over twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from its own fund investors and subsequently renovated them costlyly.
According to data, the energy reconstruction swallowed around 200 million euros.
Selling would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, experts in the field estimate the value of the previously renamed towers to "Greentowers" at a price of around 500 million euros.
The speaker said that it was not decided whether the building would be resold to the fund’s assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
The dead still haven't been rescued because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in a mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where there was an accident, but there was no sign of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend due to safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that the miners had no chance of surviving.
We still haven't managed to free the dead.
Now, relatives and friends honor the memory of the dead.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They've been quiet for two minutes.
29 tables were built to honor the monuments of the buried miners, on them helmets, lamps and names of miners.
Also pictures and personal items, such as clothes and surfboards found their place here.
On government buildings, the flags were flying at half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out of the "deep ground" to the surface again, said to the participants of the memorial event Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in a mine.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial event.
British and South African miners were also buried during the explosion on November 19.
Paramedics began by extinguishing the fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poisonous gases dissolve, the cooling of the high temperatures inside the mine begins, told journalism president Gary Knowles.
Damn it, warriors!
Is a horror movie good for an art theater?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to overcome the old borders again with his fighting epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience was the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn thinking of when he was filming "Walla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and in large quantities kills almost with the supernatural power of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young men looking for bloody action because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and fights his enemies even guts from the belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as he is actually called, will not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters will say at most one or two sentences or be brought to the sad, dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and revel in the dreadfully beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera footage.
It's good if the film has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically resists bringing his works either more humor to the mainstream or less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most fans of the art cinema seem to be discouraged by spraying brains and entrails everywhere.
The supporters of action films will be bored at the latest when One-Eye sets out with a group of violent Christian boat missionaries to Jerusalem for free, and will remain hung in the wind and fog for all eternity, until the team is likely to sail to America and remain silent there.
It is no wonder, then, that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not get into the cinemas and was now released only on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, some of the blood that's torn down, there's an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it is not about dialogue or a precise plot, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
And there's no escape for the audience.
Refn will not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly smother him with his chilly shots and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, especially with the indescribable hatred that bursts from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps One-Eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all the most one-eyed heroes whose motives will never be explained, who in time will become a warrior of hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil, for enemies and temporary allies.
It represents destruction, perhaps only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and admiration.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
IAEA's nuclear power office has new alerts for a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country resists expression and does not allow control.
Around midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli combat aircraft F-15 I attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of Euphrat; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The International Bureau of Nuclear Energy (IAEA) documents reveal its name when it comes to a reactor reportedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley, which is turning away from the current.
Based on a communication from the US-American CIA foreign secret service at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technique from the '50s is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation she explained where the components of the reactor could have been before the destruction, it was supposed to be a reduced copy of North Korea's model nuclear centre Yongbyon.
In addition, there were still photographs that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be short before the launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, there is not much more known than then, even the riddles grew even larger over time.
Former US-President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but basically had no evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some intelligence agents in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a 'alleged reactor', even if they consider the presentation of the CIA to be 'good faith'.
They're missing clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
On the question of how sure he is that he has a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat responded in the summer, the IAEA said that "the shortage of material to ask questions".
The structure allegedly "unused military buildings" was quickly cleared out by the Syrians and also properly leveled the terrain.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 the IAEA team was able to find traces of uranium, which was made by humans, under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the period just after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market, because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA can therefore not confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, expressed by Damascus.
But that's what the IAEA disproved after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss matters - as well as satellite images.
In addition, he banned the auditors from the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel also keeps its mouth shut.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed recently the official position of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has been dragging on since June 2008, and "is growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as admitted by the high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - this is a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty that the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three other devices to be "functional" connected to the alleged reactor to be the key to progress and, unlike it, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet mentioned, nor which equipment is involved, nor what function they have or why they are suspected.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA internally identifies it as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite images, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently, it is inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason, Syria rejects the IAEA's access to these three locations.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been sent in advance by the US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the U.S. intelligence facility.
The IAEA has backgrounds and satellite images that transported the material back and forth between these three places and the square at Euphrat.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one should be "in connection with the production of fuel".
However, there is no "documents on sensible activities", i.e. enrichment of uranium and reprocessing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where it should later be degraded into a bomb, there are only likely estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether the debris that could hide important traces are stored in these three locations.
It's as if hundreds of cargo cars have disappeared off the face of the earth, no one seems to have any information as to where the debris has gone.
Only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, and on the other side of Euphrat, the al-Tibni salt mine, which had Syria inspected as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste in 1998, considers the IAEA unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked him to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspicious locations of earthwork and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the IAEA has spent many months working on a revision plan that would allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets - only the effort shows the great interest of the revisions.
Meanwhile, Damascus rejected this proposal.
If, a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna calmed down that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why the thing is not burning, the US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the harshest means the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already talked about the "opportunity to which I lean in the future", but he is hesitant so far.
This choice poses a great risk: on the one hand, the majority of the IAEA Governors need to do so, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love in Wartime
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on the nameless first-names in the summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, it's the love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
That's all they know yet - but that's also causing unrest.
There is persistent talk that the woman who is Muslim falls in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s societies were immediately protesting, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
In the meantime, the film has finished in Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN-organization to help UNHCR Jolie refugees and asked to meet an actress, now informed Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also the UN-organization ambassador to help refugees.
It's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims reveals a lot about the script.
So her organization recommended the UN-organization to help the refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, informing the Guardian.
What kind of scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given the opportunity to read her script, allowed the filming to be done after minor moves in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author emphasizes that in her film she does not follow any political intentions, that with great effort she devoted herself to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Given the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of a film on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war began and meet again when she is a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds a lot different than "victim rape falls in love with your torturer."
The fact that Jolie really begins before the war is true.
Jolie argues that pressure is being put on her, which is "not fair and based on false information".
Now they can free her from Hollywood: By illegally publishing on the Internet her script, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening is good for the Irish again.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar at the sound of loud music, stomping their feet.
Bailey-Pub's South Korean Cork boils because the players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and they hit it.
"Beer Pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus and also tickets to Las Vegas for the World Cup in beer Pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this screamed beer game and a reticent computerist, it doesn't match very well.
Still, a 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, unresponsive from the burdensome question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, he's going on an interview in New Zealand in January.
"I have a weird feeling about this," he says.
"It's so far and I don't have a job there."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign", says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have attempted their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving: Just like the Tanners, it looks like a lot of families on the island.
100,000 Irish people leave the country in the foreseeable future, forecasting experts at the ESRI Institute for Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They even count to 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be an emigration wave similar to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After decades of rising, which has brought great prosperity to the Irish, unsatisfaction is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly upsetting young, educated Irish people, who have only experienced an increase so far.
The loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was lost.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are out of work.
There are many letters from readers in the Irish Times who complain, "In Ireland, everything is going downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"Please turn off the last one."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black, because the government is said to be deceiving and offers no future prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wage, but have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-olds.
She watches her classmates go from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out herself in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers an overall service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, work abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps in the career ranking", says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
He's known for six months about what it's like to build something else.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed together with 15 Irish construction colleagues in Germany.
They're building a fashion house at Gelsenkirchen right now.
In January he continued to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to pay off a house loan at home.
"Situation is sometimes a bit crazy," he says, for the first time in a long time, crossing the threshold of his own house.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in."
He laughs embarrassedly and walks through cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, large expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100-percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money was without many questions," he says.
He's worried it might not go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The engineer doesn't like the moaning he hears so often these days.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"For a while to work abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back again and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keep the future open and simply wait for life to evolve elsewhere.
He's also had several years of work in London, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that concerns him very much these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might go wrong for the bachelor party.
"No emotions at all," he says, and he drinks a good beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a departure party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private business.
Criminal activity raises more concern than unemployment.
And Brazil sees many regions as more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of an up - to - date Latino survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the area.
In this year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where economics recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are the democrats' convictions, which pulls down the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the area expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (Figure 3).
About 34% said they trusted the council in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same figures as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
The support was created during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again dropped to 32% in 2009.)
But the mood changes in a wide spectrum from earth to earth (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
Only the second time more respondents across Latin America have seen crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem since surveys began (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to the figure 38% from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private business and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage has increased from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has risen from 47% of last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area, as 19% mentioned (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized Options
No one expected the general elections in Haiti to be perfect on 28 November.
But they were much worse than the underdogs who were trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections meant filling urns and repetitive voting, ballots scattered around the canals, broken polls and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved because of the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of supposed forerunners, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the election to be closed.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways, these were quite good choices."
Observers from the Organization of the American States and the Caribbean said cautiously that 'they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they were, did not necessarily have to cancel the process'.
In other words, the show continues.
The election body, whose opposition votes are owed to René Préval, the unpopular resigning president and his candidate Jude Célestine, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected final match is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martella, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former First Lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is identified by the electoral commission as having achieved a decisive fight.
Because of the rampant cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there was concern that electoral participation would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
Approximately 250,000 ID cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained undivided shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a fundamental step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
It is clear, then, that the Haitians will do so themselves.
On tiptoe to the center
In the weeks when she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, has benefited from public sympathy, with her popularity increasing from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in the next year may depend on the grieving Mrs. Fernández giving up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these marks, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income as they please.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost most of it in Congress last year.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner for a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the reigning political movement Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (on which the government was slapped and accused of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, while the President will have more space to spend as much as she likes.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to be up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 1.1.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions are talking about a figure that is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina suffered economic collapse, set the priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared INDEC, a statistical agency that agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by growth in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on major devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is making it clear that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government established an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused debt restructuring, which Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now, President Fernández is facing an agreement with the creditor governments that are grouped up in the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be seen by the IMF as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index that will commemorate the introduction to INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce many of the views her husband held in politics.
Half-encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted for mayors and city councils in five city districts on 27 November, which can be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail over the mainland and have a strong commitment to business relations, including the partial free trade agreement, in the greatest reconciliation of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only close.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayor's offices, it was unable to win by a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined to more independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against the 45% KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has decreased by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP side together with KMT was in city councils.
Elections took place like most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags with savings on girls.
Part of it was even a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
The man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over the face, hurt him and killed the spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the armed man intended to hurt Mr. Lieno or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Perhaps the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the issue of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates struggled with plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also dropped the encouragement of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the reality and awareness that China’s trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma has confirmed for his party that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue with commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would certainly also like to see political integration, but first things first.
It would be better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and a supporter of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation has evolved, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been summoned as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything they can to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their actions can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a 'trustworthy alternative' to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be fighting for a choice among potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's evaluations were bad, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go on the campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
KMT's spokesman says he's reorganizing his cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Grammy Award nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
The appearance at the request of the President and people must inevitably notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who Obama chose to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is described as one of Grammy's surprise awards this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with the rules of Grammy, when the artist must not publish more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Her ambitious album from 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward and thanks to its carefree vocal style and agile hands with pop elements, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spaldingová as a success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent to the Grammys who have been looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere Grammy judges rightly appreciate the Vijay Iyer Trio "History" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing album ride that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophone player James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Thrombone Shorty, a hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber albums.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, with the knowledge of steampunk, won several well-deserved awards in the category of large ensembles, where the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bass player could have a free hand as a band leader.
Grammy Awards Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd Grammy Awards.
Head of the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California appeared Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No.4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, including orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was given to Bruckner and his Symphony No.3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" project from Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saaria and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers nominated for Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
It's called "Los Angeles" for about 30 minutes and it's dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who's trapped in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental performance by soloist with orchestra.
The L.A. composer said that he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using notes from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a phone conversation.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for the leadership of Chicago Symphony during recording works by Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nomination are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula is being approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics challenged the project to promote terrorism and lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in accordance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will recall," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"As an American citizen, I'm very proud of that."
"It means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who oppose only shout loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time it took discussions with people who were pro or against the center. These votes were evenly divided, says Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families lived in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he rented along with the manufacturer of filtration systems.
The new mosque with dimensions of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow up to 43 feet.
It should occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Arsenic-resistance microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, extends space to search for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been previously considered and fundamental.
"This organism has a dual power."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"This is a very strange fact, but it is not proof that it is a form of truly 'alien' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
For a long time, six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur - have been considered essential for life.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"You will start to wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the news.
This finding is significant for searching for life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life may look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this news, published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the discovery, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That's not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows replacing one element with another element in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, thus considering that microb, which is exposed to both elements, can be able to replace one after another.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hard to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that, like phosphorus, it doesn't work. When it gets into the organism, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing arsenic concentrations, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus, but because they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility is increased that the life form that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or on the moon, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but there was never an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used by former life forms.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four dog shows that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, reported to the sheriff of the Los Angeles area on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and a large pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, the authorities reported.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were discovered late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which location, as well as did not share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not able to comment on the case.
They were very happy when on Wednesday afternoon their two Akitas were found in a shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old male Trace and 10 month-old female Didi, were unharmed, reported by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breeds, who planned to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undetected until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were supposed to compete in other competitions scheduled the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop on almost a month's steam tour of dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside the window of the room.
They also took with them three dogs - a pup boxer, Parson Russell terrier and a Breton fireman - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke left Welsh corgis in a car that was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so the dogs would have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who leads them to missing dogs, dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
On Thursday it was not clear whether prices would be awarded.
Once again, the lion is ready to roar now that MGM’s restructuring has received final approval from the court
After 18 months of upheaval and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvency Judge of New York officially blessed the "pre-packaged" plan of creditors to settle about $5 billion of debt, thus clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy order leaves MGM with no legal obstacles to relaunching the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will be chief leaders of the shrunken studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
It is now a connection with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co., an investment bank, was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, as management fought to afford $300 million a year’s interest payments.
On August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnover expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the funds required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which collect for their services that run the company, $375,000 a month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restore production in MGM, which in this year released only one film and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will come out in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films whose draft will be the book "Hobit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debts, sought to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he was the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your gift budget in balance
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant impact on the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 bead ropes or approximately 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was in place; this year's technological toys have much more energy at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to last years.
While relatively fewer new toys with associated websites appeared, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries increases, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some references.
(All listed prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases which are marked differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, since 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
One press gives the animal a tone and the other push begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year I borrowed a 14-inch animatric doll from Elmo Live Technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with bike blocking.
Kids test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn a car ride into fun with a self-corrected, funny workbook.
If you're snooping for a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years of age) is the cheapest option with easy use, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years of age), the first significant Leapster series change from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years of age) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books and has a SD card slot that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children aged 8) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than a matchbox, each of which has a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before time runs out; it is great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented to the highest extent in toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children aged 6 to 12), which contains a coin with hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits at the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include roller skates or Puffle animals.
A little bit bigger than your toothbrush brush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years of age), the latest in a series of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny when you make a maze out of cubes and see if he can find a way out.
It's also very durable.
Ours was able to fall with the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
The introduction of a more delicate police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked across the square, strictly controlled his orders and issued orders in a semi-voiced manner with military authority.
He wanted female members - Chinese strong enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their hard interventions and a passion for violence - to convey some impression of a group of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, she whispers quietly, "What nice girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood at attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted according to the ruler.
Four headgear perfectly match the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look mediocre," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of the city’s overseers in China.
One city ordered new recruits to have a university education.
Guangdong Province has turned gray-green uniforms into supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the shaky looks for strong armor: in 2009 it was reported that 50 officers surrounded the snack cart and gazed intently at the owner until after half an hour, the door-to-door salesman packed up and left.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main picture.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women, selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would be in trouble to join secret Chinese city groups.
The critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce a city decree, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media commonly capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei beat an unattended viewer to death after using his cell phone to shoot, as they did in the intervention against the landfill protest.
Last year there was a training of police officers in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, there was a description of how to effectively beat up the perpetrators without any sign of blood.
This year, a melon peddler in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injury to the left part of the brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, lamented last year after another debate on tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly cleaned."
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised an interest in eight new female police officers in October, the editorial The Beijing Evening News discussed whether women have real responsibilities or are merely distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The county demanded female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "five face traits in the right proportion."
The adapters should have a height higher than the diameter - i.e. more than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
The functionaries say that work is mentally too demanding for women over 25 years of age.
"Their image is an important thing," said an unnamed policeman on Rednet.com, as if a government website.
"The candidates must first demonstrate the external qualities, which then determine the others, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said and added, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City Board, does not agree with this description.
But he pointed out that height requirements are common in China for other positions, both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetry of the face.
Which means the question of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow us to serve a lame or hunchy person," said Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who holds a patrol on Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years old, faces like apples and a softly shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her workmate with dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They do not object to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely to drive traders into the alleys where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, the group stands against more than ten marketers who run on foot or on wheels and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu, when the hitter started running, and for a time he left his bike with a noodle cart.
Cops describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in her free time.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the authority of their male counterparts to seize the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that is common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumors were spread that police officers had killed sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or lit.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where a police officer was patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Cops confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry all he wanted.
15 minutes away from the cops, looking angry, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator attached to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over 40 who already have only a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and smoothing image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr Li in a matter of fact.
"Most of the time, it's the public who's gonna start."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge involving his affair with a former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, who, until the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
Mr. Ensign's office said that the decision that followed almost a year's investigation was "surely pleased".
The senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the target of the investigation and that it was not intended to press further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department has refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times stated that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr Hampton and to support their views after they employed Mr Hampton to lobby for them, so much do the documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was expelled from lobbying by his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, was in conflict with the prohibition of lobbying.
From the evidence that was published "it turned out to be a clear case of preparing a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are investigated by the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for Senator Ensign's decision, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said that the Ministry was cautious about political lawsuits, after a large number of failures, including last year's decision to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens in the midst of the prosecution of state's misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a law firm that filed several complaints against Mr.
"It shows essentially that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's attorney-in-chief, told him that on Monday he was called by the D.A. of the D.A. and then the next day, and told him that the D.A. found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated on Wednesday's statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments which he had passed on to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable describing the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop an investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethical group is charging the payment of Ensign Hampton's parents to $96,000 in violation of the federal electoral law.
The election committee said that she didn't have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbyist job was NV Energy, the leading Nevada company that has long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist in the company, Mr.Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr.Hampton and told him that he was "beating" to the Home Office about the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for a lobbyist job.
When last year's news of the affair first appeared, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third Senate term.
In the report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hopes that the ethics committee will quickly follow the Justice Department and end the investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the people of Nevada," she said.
The challenge of Cheshire village turns to Twitter
There were half a dozen in the courtroom lines.
One minute later, they were sending news of a terrible witness on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter reports dealt with raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, there was a trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and was to take place an official termination with the imposition of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by major reporters - has created a "circle atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then introduced a jury in a decision in terms of public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether, with the emergence of new technologies, he would also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes' main defense attorney.
The judge of Jon C. Blue's trial of the Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claim regarding last week's yield and the fact that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases may raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the conviction of the Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that Sheppard v. Maxwell was a "carnaval atmosphere" in the media trial.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration of the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the Courts of Appeal, which reviewed Hayes' judgment half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine how to communicate from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable for Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out freely.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is only one of Mr. Hayes' many outlined lawyers who would have been able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
The defense also claims, for example, that Mr. Hayes's case may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos of terror in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors reported that they were appalled by photographs of the victims who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defenders claim that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that by his decision he wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think on the weekend.
The judges weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They objected to the verdict raised last month that the case dominated reports in Connecticut and was debated during the election campaign by candidates for governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly stirring up the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in court," wrote the lawyer, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that immediate reporting was more outrageous than the later reports, and from their point of view, the judicial police should control the field of action of further trials.
But some lawyers have demanded appeal courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adjustments to the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in Dr. Sheppard's judgment, due to the breadth of the proceedings, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is a case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was remarkable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of true cooperation between two political parties or just an illusion before returning quickly to the party fight in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and parliamentary leaders has not brought any major discoveries on the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, this was a polite discussion dealing with differences of opinion between the two sides, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
The Wednesday public meeting of the President’s deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close cooperation has built up mutual respect for several months that goes beyond the ideological gap that still divides the members.
And it's quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they are sounding each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's negotiations and its subsequent evaluation by participants were carried out with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to propose a rapid change in the conditions that have been there for the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"These are inevitable after the election.
The election stirred up the emotions of the pagers, and then they quieted down.
It's good."
On several issues, particularly those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax reduction expired at the end of the year, and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot look at how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed refuse unemployment benefits.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, you can see more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties when the 112th Congress is convened for January.
Rather, there is likely a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, said.
"After the things that must be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that courtesy will lead to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the compilation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, know that they must act according to their promises and reduce government spending and abolish the new health care law.
These support lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes, the increase of pension age and the reduction of expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their opinion, put pressure on the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore to fight to get as close as possible to this number.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the jury, who propose that we have, at least today, a small foundation or will for compromise in the case of financial issues.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will start next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans call on Obama to address the budget, taxes, and health care, when a period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What's the cause of the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the partyism of the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could be headed towards the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very closely monitoring the public's reactions.
Anyone who threatens to vote down will probably change course and seek compromise.
That can be an optimistic view.
Stranicity and direction are now greater than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there has been a greater ideological gap between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than it was with the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that came up this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
The revealed American document depicts Moscow as a refuge for corruption
City management is in the hands of the "kleptocracy", and it continues with part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to the Kremlin, the American Embassy in Russia reported in the February records.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings to help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called 'vertical office' - will take its own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
A record sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was posted on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record shall be based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor, accusing him of a large share of corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelen Baturin, who owns a prominent construction company, have been constantly denying corruption charges for many years, and he has won several lawsuits for false accusations for such accusations.
In September, at the Russian TV station, when he was asked to testify to corruption, he said, "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also outrageous that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of Moscow and its connection to the criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional' and confirm that the government operates more as kleptocracies than as a government," says the report.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'Krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Interior Ministry and the State's Attorney's Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"The Analysts have identified a three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal security services, Ministry of the Interior and militia are in the second grade."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are common criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill blanks in certain areas, as the city does not provide certain services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (preferably than organized criminal groups), because they have not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on course."
The record says that while money withdrawal is complex, protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who don't pay fast enough, their business is closed under various pretenses.
Medvedev spoke several times about combating corruption, but he admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably loaded with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats in his fight against corruption," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem research team in Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that national corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the Transparency International NGOs (the countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
Uncovering the news of the American embassy, which appeared in Moscow only in the late evening, certainly did not bring enthusiasm to the Russian government, although only to the point that Luzhkov may be accused of Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be a possibility for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin reported that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been counterfeit and responded angryly to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedov Robin.
"The truth about the matter is that it is our mutual interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethical."
The Khmer Red Veterans are forced to deal with the past
In a savings-lit concrete classroom with soiled and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, leader of the Khmer Reds Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his savagery during the Khmer Red government, the commander remains popular in this remote possession of the Khmer Reds in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Reds gave up their government, long-standing loyalty is also broken down in Anlong Vengo.
In April, victims at the Forum of Truth and Reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Khmer Reds and their former soldiers.
And in July, bring together the UN and Cambodian court the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Reds, the execution of a former leader, a notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, the unrest among the veterans of the Khmer Reds in Anlong Veng increased, which complicates the efforts to reconcile and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
"Among the former Khmera Reds is hatred and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them life among the Khmer Reds was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Red government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or starved, ill or overworked.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrowd the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and his soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary controlled guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Big groups of Red Khmer fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured in 1999 by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Red warriors have fallen into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgicly recall the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Reds maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, like unskilled farmers.
"These people only benefited from surrender," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideologies of the regime."
"They were brought up without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Reds as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Reds was good," he said.
"The Mok made a living."
"But now life is hard, because we have to take care of everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Red Court also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate Nuon Che, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Reds.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the fears of Anlong Vengo.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Red government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
A recent steamy evening with Im Chae returned from working in the field to his wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Reds.
If the court had summoned her, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there's another prosecution, there'll be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Reds in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out other suspects, although experts and historians disagreed.
"Cambodja must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"A reconciliation in Khmer conditions means sticking together broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so we can understand each other."
The center published the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Reds, has 75 pages and the name "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties about the Red Khmer.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng knew little detail about the Khmer Reds, despite the connection of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said that the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complicated and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks, and the court are starting to have influence, he said further.
The Khmer Reds still have a powerful spell here.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains, the road is covered with weeds and sprinkled with discarded plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle made of black soot covered with rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot’s resting place later, where she will bring a bundle of ripe bananas in the hope that it will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it seems to have stockpiles of uranium-based weapons
In a surprising victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would give up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of State Sergei Martynov in Belarus after the Security Summit.
For years, the US government has tried to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have stumbled upon the stone of injury last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months, a few classified operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This has paved the way for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to a subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the summit on nuclear safety2012."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their supplies of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
During the Obama summit on nuclear safety, Belarus’s President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago and showed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was slightly irradiated, announced by officials.
It was loaded on a special train, which travelled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian facility for storage and disposal, said officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, said officials.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of which on delivering less enriched uranium to the Belarusian Research Institute, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust", which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus has at least £88 of uranium available for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, endeavour to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual thawing.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and this is essential for the progress of the country and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish Government did not go too far with CIA flights
The Spanish government did not go too far with CIA flights transporting imprisoned Talibans and Al-Qaeda members to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, as the US envoy in Madrid said in his telegram.
This follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País server, which also states that Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega had requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus show that she had proper supervision of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
in June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, in which a dozen states, including Spain, were charged with complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernánndez de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "takes Zapatero's government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are "not caught unprepared", says Aguirre in one of the documents.
At the time, Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the lowest possible outlines on this matter, but by the fact that this matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as he is concerned, he did not intend to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence regarding CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating file or sensitive information", explained the Embassy after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern over the "clear coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassification of CNI or Ministry of Defence information.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly among governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba's lunch, he told the ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had already given instructions to his colleagues, "let them avoid heated comments with a view to reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - c.o.) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that Zapatero's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
Confessed mother-murderer complained on the network at the mother's "care"
A young woman spoke of a child when she was dead, and she had her blog: "Terror after Galicia"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname she had been using since she was young, communicating with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the municipality of Noia in La Coruňa, where a young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman’s emotional life that ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30 - year - old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
Before long, she found a new boyfriend.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her in Palma for a week.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she's alone in Menorca, and she says, "Alberto's upset that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just received, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where to send you the baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his home: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only staying until 19, because I have to go to work so I don't lose my job."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son in.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, me, and it'll never happen again in my life that I'll leave him with someone other than my mother", a dubious intent given her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When he taps this message, the child who arrived on the island on the first day of that month is presumed to have been murdered on the 10th is already dead.
"César is satisfied on one hand, but not satisfied on the other."
"He's with me on one side and he likes it here, but he goes to school on the other side almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Majorca.
"He'll go there (son) to summer school, so I'll save a little money for the nanny."
The 17th greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you some e-mail videos, look how he wants to meet me, sex is needed."
On the 30th, another report: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also a report about Victor, the current partner, "Gives me money."
On the Internet are Móniča's posts at the blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she used to call herself "Muki ex-inmate."
"Terror after Galician (motto)".
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she came from a detention center in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, stated that the defendant does not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before, however, she admitted to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his body in the trunk.
The defense and the D.A. are asking for a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would have won 4 seats in the House and the PSC would have lost 9 mandates
With the results of November 28, the PP party could have the lead at the town hall in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (the People's Party of Catalonia) already has the idea of universal elections, whether or not there is an increase, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually one such than the election of Catalan.
In 2008, the Catalan People’s Party won 610.473 votes in general elections, whereas in the 2006 Autonomous elections, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384.091 votes.
If this tendency of escalation, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyal voters of the PP, the analysts of this party calculated that if the elections were to take place general, the PPC could win 12 Members in the House compared to the current 8, the CiU side (Convergencia i Unió, Czech Match and Union - note of the rule) would also receive 4 mandates (now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and PSOE parties (Spain Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the peoples, the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one member - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would still have one mandate, or it would gain one more.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next meeting will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of socialist domination in the four major provincial cities as well as on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest budget envisaged - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and peoples agree that the PSC could lose the town hall in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive the majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona Council - as it is necessary to win at least 5% of the vote.
PP has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
Lidovci also gained at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
currently has PP representation at 34 city halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda.
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian who were arrested by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadi cell controlled from Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of Al-Qaeda organization, including the "Tiger Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", the second group being the author of the bombings in Mumbai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure, through the "operation Kampai", the weakening of Al-Qaeda's counterfeit apparatus at international level and "restrict its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that within two years of being active in Catalonia, this cell could send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then forged and then shipped to groups that form the criminal galaxy of the Al Qaeda organization, so that their "warriors" could travel impunityly across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations besides Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that in the following days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries like the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed in Thailand another in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsant and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were captured.
It was these men who drove from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, a part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between 25 and 45 years of age, had to be valid for several years and were free of marked visas.
The investigation documents point out that so far no facts are known that would link the detainees of Catalonia to the bombing in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should have been one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that several days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency, which were "inserted" to purchase cards on mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have already confiscated a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) is asking Maso to stop the fiscal agreement
Yesterday, President of the PPC Party (Catalan People's Party) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity to personally present her terms to Arthur Mas, on which she is willing to support his entry into office as President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is the recovery of the economy and the abandonment of risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the leaders of nationalists want to propose during their mandate.
The Chair of the Catalan People's Party has attended a meeting with Arthur Mas with the certainty of the 18 parliamentary seats received in last Sunday's elections, which is more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the candidate CiU needs at least one of the formations constituting the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that nationalists would like to hold in the House when the general elections are held, but so far, the talks that Mas is conducting these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan spirit.
With regard to the president of the PP to gain her support for putting into office, "he will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches", as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque Country - which the CiU leader even wanted to put to the vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the rampant political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Masov's entry into office will be discussed within PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised a hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalana).
The director of the Geriatric Facility assures that deaths have not been caused by a "lack of action"
The presentation of the centre of Olot does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Center of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to explain the damage caused by Joan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who, while employed here, killed at least 11 seniors in his care.
The director of this senior home, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the facility, Joan Canada's attorney, announced that "the wish of La Caritat's home would enable him to press charges against the guilty man" responsible for the killing, but "legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this trial to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it did not detect the criminal activities of caregivers in time, La Caritat now poses a major threat to La Caritat’s home for material compensation requirements, which are already being calculated by the legal representatives of the surviving families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the elderly home clients, suspecting that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased, but that, given the age and poor health of the patients, everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat, through her director yesterday, resolutely rejected this extremeness and pointed out that "the lack of action could in no way have been the cause of what had happened".
La Caritat's attorney added that "there are no indications in the case that any third party, other than their own accused, has committed misconduct".
The man now nicknamed "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 deaths yesterday and stated that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and killed the second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, death was caused by administration of too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of soothing tablets.
Director La Caritat noted that it is difficult to control the access of personnel to medical devices.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably six out of nine of the means used by this caregiver to kill patients in their efforts to relieve them of suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now taking place in the laboratory should show whether the Villa is lying and was actually looking for a less cruel death for its first victims, or killed them by lye administration, as he had already admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
in La Caritat, they don't believe in medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of deaths may be higher than the one he confessed to, and they justify their behavior in the various versions that Villa gave to the court, knowing that he had to change his actions when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to illuminate the full scope of the matter.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Investors responded sharply yesterday to yesterday's threat to President Trichet of the European Central Bank, who pointed out that 'markets should not underestimate our ability to react'.
Marginal differentials have been closed by force, and European banks' shares have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although there is a decline, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It'll take the investor some time to lose his fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow, it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan to buy out the State debt for the inefficiency and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within a period of time and to leave unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be predicted 'at least by March' and to have a three-month Licitation with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and even announce its intensification.
If they fail to meet the expectations created, they will re-create the market response from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity rate, God will be with us!
The same was true at the convention in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a market collapse - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, it was announced by the armored fist on Monday, and on Wednesday it said that it had already purchased many, causing another market collapse.
Yesterday's billing for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the auction previous.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell 30 points below, reflecting the change in mood in the market after the words of Trichet.
in Ireland the figures were published represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts represent approximately 10,000 million in short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not exposing the problem with stress tests in July, the amounts under the ancillary plan are acceptable and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need Parliament's approval and still lacks sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to prevail in Ireland.
Angela Merkel eased the tone of her speech to ease the tension on her face for the next EU summit held on 14 December, which requires a political compromise to show that we are the Union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of measures approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - four years from Vivaldi to investors' ears.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased by 4.5%, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the effect of surprise.
Today we have a key bond licitation for three years, which will be favoured by the effect of Trichet, which is why, we hope, there will be a great demand for it to help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - 40,000 million in cash in El Tesoro, three times as high as in March - and access to markets would be closed down by sine die.
However, Cesare's wife's strategy should continue to be used - "not only to be it, but also to seem it."
We can do this.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack the meeting of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in open conflict in the family of Álvarez, the owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, will not cease.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge, after he considered it "insignificant", the legal conduct of El Enebro, scheduled for the 16th of this month and requested five of its seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize themselves with the help of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesús David and María José, fine-tune the legal group for the new chapter of their dispute over the domination of a part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not seem willing to back down in his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven descendants, named forerunners during the shareholders' assembly on 18 January of this year, whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register, were removed from its administration committee.
The El Enebro trial scheduled for the 16th of this month, convened by Trade Court official number 2 in Madrid, resumed the thunderstorm in the womb of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means to guarantee the convening of the commission until the dispute is resolved.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira Álvarez's Mezquiriz is considered by David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving through court fraud and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of January 18, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this act as "totally insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who discreetly remain silent, have tried without success to call a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned alongside other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires 51% of the capital to be used.
This matter is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge in the hearing on the question of judicial assault, and the date of the hearing has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes real-time improvements in vehicles.
Since Red Bull invaded Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this new arrival team very seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, they all bet on Ferrari Fernando Alonso's triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1, a legend was born - a "secret weapon", which was placed in the hands of the multi-ethnic Siemens to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for the purpose of a very remote automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for high precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens's industrial division, explains that the use of this software device has enabled Red Bull's team to implement "in a matter of hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements during a single period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
Siemens’s manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features shall be modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical convenience is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull set up a high-tech plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "big secret".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champions Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull is the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1, no doubt.
However, other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, are hiding behind the vast technological means that the brand of energy drinks has put into its participation in racing circuits, while no one knows them.
Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was due to the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 of its own stores in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her business partner Pont Reyes opened her first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of a network of 20 80 to 100 m2 shops to be opened by this multinational company in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
Vice-President of Spanish HP Helena Herrerová presented as an example the newly rebuilt shop at Barcelona Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 sales points in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following.
Herrerová, who also runs HP personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening shops would still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
North American company advises here with exclusive design equipment stores (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of business personnel.
Helena Herrerová denied that it was franchising and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, serving, after-sales service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of a worldwide pilot pioneering programme aimed at addressing potential problems with computer devices under warranty.
Online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes that can otherwise last up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, since large companies already have a contractual service of technical assistance", Helena Herrerová emphasized yesterday.
Sabadell's betting on stealing a million clients from his competitors in three years.
More optimistic than other bosses, a delegation member of Banco Sabadell Bank Board, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it expects a reduction in interest rates, which will, however, seek to compensate for the reduction in bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to be able to acquire a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - or 700,000, if those who eventually leave the bank - because until now, the Institute has been pampering small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or one can also say sobriety, in order to reduce the costs the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare set targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for world banking.
Sabadell will close his Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the meeting held by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the journey from the crisis in Spain will be "longer".
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create employment" in two or three years' time, which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, added.
And although they believe that passive war - which reduces margins - is retreating, the price of the premium for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus compensating for the reduction in margins.
"The liquidity and financing theme is structural and will represent a pressure factor on loans".
"We haven't closed the faucet yet, but the differentials are very high", acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued orders on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking 'now is to cut commissions', but there is a 'competitive framework'.
Sabadell Bank’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required".
"The next year will not remain a stone," he assured.
It confirms that the capital needs are "much reduced" and does not preclude a Spanish institution entering the red numbers.
It points out that FROB may be in charge of collecting funds on the market before the new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, some bankers continue to pose a serious problem as predicting a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but, unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave by fusion of savings banks
The CEO of CECA rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of mergers of savings banks, and again insisted on the speed with which the sector was reorganised.
When the process of pooling Spanish savings banks started, several institutions were satisfied that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening is the conventions".
"Most are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated very well in this matter", said the director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting, Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process was taking place "at the highest possible rate and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the instalments that have appeared at the time, not now, in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank."
"Go from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus in accordance with the Basel Treaty", underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are many not very happy opinions about the slowness of the process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is a reminder that we must be in due course before the end of the year".
Yesterday, CEO of CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta assured that Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, we can 'be calm' about financial institutions and savings banks as well as a system that has mastered the 'very important' concentration process and which continues 'at the highest possible speed'.
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, regulation of private intermediary agencies, or cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed people without benefits, to privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management - c.), airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, has, on the other hand, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel because of her responsibility for triggering the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complicated redefinition process of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is supposed to be like, which is referring to the idea of observing old traditions, which is followed by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European opposition, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although it may now appear to be a science fiction, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to Germany's proposals, the reworking of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigour, fines for the guilty states, possible deferrals for some of them, and the extension of the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is now no room for spins.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a discrepancy between what Germany considered correct (the fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully extended her decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also published was strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October Merkel reappeared with a clear opinion, demanding to reform the European Union's conventions in order to enable the rescue of a Member State and at the same time allowing private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat moderate form, has been approved, and over the coming months we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has set a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures are now needed, which it seems to disagree with too much, from that date, the old operation of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which states breaking the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare deferment of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a strict path of growth with increased savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
They simply do not intend to tolerate another option based on debt and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed in the years of Spain’s growth boom.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they're asking us to do is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could get ourselves wrong.
I hope that these current turbulence will relieve more calm.
And that we'll take advantage of the opportunity they're giving us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his double statement (reforms promised after meeting with large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) makes it clear that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the way has opened up to the idea that things need to be fixed.
However, the red line that Germany has set out is there, and it does not seem to want to move it.
And leaving the euro area full of not-so-serious countries cannot be excluded from the options to be considered.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The tricks performed by Alonso and Ramos in the match with Ajax show the wit, not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League game against Ajax on November 23 caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is unsportsmanship and whether or not UEFA should punish both footballers.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (who had their team clearly won) appointed players one by one deliberately wasted time at the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfill the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in the lead - and they will be able, free of cards, to continue to the next stage.
Finally, the Disciplinary Commission of UEFA gave coach José Mourinh a two-game penalty and the guilty players were fined in cash.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, that is, rules that are unwritten, but follow each other.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was Real Madrid (who boasts generosity and honour in his anthem, and who has already fined his player for similar actions), and it seems that the drama led by Mourinhem, which thus adds another episode to his long history of comedian and provocateur.
in any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of action, which is not explicitly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is circumvention of the law in these acts; indeed, it is actions that respect sports rules, whose meaning seems to be trying to circumvent.
The type of damage such actions cause to the sports spirit is being addressed.
One aspect of sports behaviour is the physical integrity of the opponents, which was not violated in these cases, so there was no violent play.
Another of these features characterizing a clean game is to avoid allowing players to have an advantage against the team because of their offense - which also did not happen here.
So the paradoxical thing about Real Madrid players’ action is that what we normally characterise as a ruse or circumvention of the law did not occur, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should have been as obvious as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited and liked to be punished.
The next question, however, is what advantage guilty of their intentional transgressions will have.
It is necessary to state here that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position and that in the current match there is no advantage, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
The advantage is obviously that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by doing so, players will be punished, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which one card less than the first round will be eliminated.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, which includes making strategic decisions that allow maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, players did not aim to avoid the granting of punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between ingenuity and circumvention of the rules is not clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly ingenuity.
It seems to me that controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusion and because of the way in which the instructions were transmitted to provoke them from the leadership.
Damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fight offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictate concentrates this year's reserve avalanche on December 16th and 17th.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid by employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December again, there are pre-Christmas parties that still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in a fight to get clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the asked entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
In order to complete the complication of the numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) on the application for a week from 13 December, creating an avalanche of reservations for peak days (16. and 17.), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been happening since 2008, when thin years began, many companies have abolished collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To avoid abandoning traditions, many employees pay for their own expenses at parties.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of load capacity, claims the president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities at the moment dares not predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will think twice before making a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they are careful when it comes to the topic of prices," he adds.
Trades will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", says and recalls that due to the crisis customers tend to go down a degree and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
The survey at various facilities shows that the biggest strain of booking requests is on the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group reports a real reserve boom this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, which has been adjusted by the menus offered, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
In another important company, which is Andilana, which is 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the speciality of this year's calendar has brought more early reservations since the beginning of November.
"We have done both possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have seen an increase in profits since the second half and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The sources of this company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
they added Christmas menus to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they experienced a tendency to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine) compared to last year.
They have also noted that companies are already appearing to invite their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
The Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "revived", although clients "contracted to the maximum".
This impression did not give way during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan’s nuclear program produced great unrest in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a "faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of Foreign Affairs, published by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary unrest that triggers Pakistan’s nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and important details that they offer about the content of communication and ideas of North American diplomacy representatives in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security rather than increasing, "is in retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after works to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of Washington's main reasons for vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan in a report prior to the visit of the former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged diversion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of nuclear material transport".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the missile program is no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as a spreading and representing reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or missile-controlled programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian State Department at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news of the documentation published by Julian Assange’s server is the increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
The dispatches issued by the embassy in May, which qualified communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", say: "Transparence often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unresponsive or rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, states that "Despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "explain well" during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's military chief, that "the Pakistani army must put an end to silent support for terrorist groups".
Hunting for the Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking officer responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red challenge" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of facts.
Yesterday Interpol announced an "extraordinary challenge", the so-called red notice, to "localize and monitor movement" Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' attorney, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assango".
It was November 20th when the International Police Force, based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday when it received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have guidelines on the identification or localisation of Assange "in order to impose temporary ties on and release it".
However, although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person on the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notice to allow the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police component - especially if the states have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be located.
Assungge’s lawyers, who published writing yesterday, said that the thirty-nine-year-old founder of Wikileaks expressed his willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compared with the legendary Lavrentio Pavlovich Berija, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit", says the letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but she is not silent.
On Monday, Skype interviewed the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in this interview, US Secretary of State requested Hillary Clinton's resignation.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate the international conventions signed by the United States, she should withdraw," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for resignation as "stupid and absurd".
"I am not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he said to CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a high-ranking officer responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairing the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber as of January, asked the Foreign Ministry to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations "to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance to them".
Tom Flanagan, the Canadian Prime Minister's advisor Stephen Harper, went further and said that Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently had to call off.
"Obama should put a reward on him or use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for president.
"Whoever is in the government, who is responsible for leaking information, has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too mild", said Fox
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "sniffing" on the supporter of Carodo
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on their stay.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for fighting the already several internal revolts in the ranks of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia), with no result due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot be as concerned as he was with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to get new critics by blinking, which will help him to defend himself in the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to secretly speak out for his remaining in office.
By using the ballots, not by raising your hand.
If Carodo's supporters want to give the President a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid breaking up and subjugating himself.
in several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added without specifying the percentage that he would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Carodo's followers demand more than to put his office at the disposal of the President - a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercós controls the largest authority at the conventions.
But since they don't have the majority to enforce their resignation, they'll try executively to commemorate the plan from now until May.
As a result, they expect to participate in the development of a document on strategic reorientation on which management will vote on the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in exchange for promising to move the congress in autumn 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that "much loudness" harms stability, and that its goal is that once and for all, the organization should be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
in this context, it seems to be a typical article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós's ideology, this innovation consultant took it as a matter of fact that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named them five, two of whom stand out.
The first is "recomponsive" executives to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces that are from the sector inclined to Carodo.
The second target can be a big novelty.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should completely end the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes, so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by voting.
Ending the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which fought in this direction at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 cramped assembly decided that meetings had to be assessed at a special Congress on the Reforms of the Statutes.
This issue is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of this matter.
Now, without lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to re-examine the matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 murdered in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, as reported by MILENIO.
Among the murders, three women stand out and a couple of separate bodies found in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate months of the year, Mexico has a total of 390 homicides, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, then a blow from grace to the head, and her hands and legs were bound by a rope.
The next day, a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlan colony, in the Naucalpan district.
Early this morning on Thursday, November 4, cooperatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50 - year - old man was murdered by eight shots in Zahualcoyotl after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims were killed with a bullet to the head at the age of 30 in San Pedro Xalaxtoc, Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, a man shot in the forehead was found dead on a remote route in the El Naranjo colony, and a shell casing from a 25-caliber gun was found under the body.
parts of the human body were found in the sewage channel in the Playa Golondrin colony in Ecatepec.
The rescue forces did a thorough search for other parts of it, but they didn't find them.
The Tepotzotlan residents reported the body found with their hands tied back and their heads wrapped in Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in Atizapan de Zaragoza County was reported, and there were also reports of a death threat in the victims.
A day later, she was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in Los Reyes La Paz County, a cardboard box containing a human head.
In a nearby colony was found the rest of the body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in Ixtapaluca County, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, a man was found murdered wrapped in a yellowish sheet, which was provisionally identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report left by the killers at his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no life signs was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla with two wounds to the back of her head.
On the skin of the woman was discovered a tattoo of the sacred figure Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death") and also necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a corpse of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, two men were found with their heads wrapped in tape and a report was also found in Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim's report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations that said, "This is what happens to those who don't adapt."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found, bearing signs of torture and bound limbs, inside an abandoned taxi to the San Agustín Colony.
The last day of the month two men were found in Los Reyes La Paz and Zahualcoyotl districts.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancon and was wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with tape and left with a message; while the second was tortured and was found in plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Agents and a message note were found with him.
China follows its target to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of this country at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce carbon footprint, specifying that he insisted on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, a representative of this country at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to transform its industry.
He said that his country has already invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the last four years.
But he has made it clear that China will not change its objectives and continue to work on this with the international community.
He reported that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
On all these points, they have already seen progress, including last year's adoption of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
He also stressed that in China, the federal authorities cooperated in a coordinated manner with the provincial and local authorities to achieve their energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
Furthermore, as he said, various plans have been in operation or have already been completed for several years, which are financed by both the Chinese Government and other governments.
For example, as he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years, has received investments from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change is also running, the project of exchange of fluorescent lamps for energy-saving bulbs and the project of mitigation and adaptation has also been specified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert advisor for climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than they are generally thought.
For example, it described greenhouse gas emissions per capita representing 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects it to make further progress by 2020.
Exclusion of Espina: Caesar Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) stated that the former Chairman of this Party is entitled to demand its law with the National Order Commission.
The National Chairman of the PAN Party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was enacted, and that the former Chairman of the Party is entitled to refer to the National Order Commission and to claim its right.
in an interview taken prior to the statement of objection by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina is in any event a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address his case through a complaint to the National Council's Order Commission in order to make a decision made by the competent authority", he added.
He also explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that she was never at the negotiating table about the alliance’s presidency.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that PAN would come out of the internal elections held the following 4 and 5 December, in which his follower would be elected, strengthened.
"This (the alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was the intention for local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose", he said.
The chairman of the PAN said that he has been behind his party for 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition, we are benefiting from it and strengthening us", he added.
He said that the committee could without question elect the best chairman or chairman that the PAN deserves for the next three years, so it will pass the relay to the 'whom the committee will appoint'.
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of the five proudly hand over the party chairman's office".
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last elections of July would be reflected in future competitions, although "there is no time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
in this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, would represent the flag and be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and desires are put into them, and I am sure that Gabina will live up to these expectations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institution Party, Republik.)) due to his speeches within the four years he reigned, Caesar Nava called on PRI members to think about six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderón, let them start defending them, let them come out of their shell," he testified.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during the speech at the National Auditorium, since there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes a law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve it," tweeted the US president on a popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama contributed to the National Mobilization to support the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents, to his personal account.
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve it," tweeted Obama.
His brief report draws attention to an Internet link to a larger document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard", he points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless the expansion of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said that he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be drawn up.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must settle the matter of taxes before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can reach an agreement on this at some point and then we can plan the order of other matters", he said.
On Tuesday, the leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced that he would request a "vote to close the debate" concerning the Dream Act, so that the proposal for legalization of students without documents could be put to the vote in the Senate from next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
The Senator's approval of the Dream Act, or "American Dream" law, would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before they reached the age of 16, resided in the country over the last five years and were admitted to an institution of higher education or army.
However, the supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so that the organizations of his supporters are doing intense agitation to ensure that this law is passed.
The democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this bill.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act need to acquire several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters negotiate the most are the senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the resigning senator from Florida, George Lemieux, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they said they won't support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has yet to comment.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning towards another version, according to most analysts the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature inserting a finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put a finger in the wound" is similar to Czech "strike on the header - note kl.)
The second round of the cycle Pleasure from the language was a promenade where participants performed a literary gala performance
"I understand this with Sex in my language, but... A finger to the wound? What is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure from the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another round table, she explained).
The finger to the wound "brings us to the narrow", said a lovely Argentine writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this round table debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monter and Luis García Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text given to Gonzalo Celori, which Schultz later described as a great story, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist, who goes from doctor to doctor in search of knowledge of what the "morning" is like, from whom she does not get answers, although the traces of the same story do.
She's leaving the infectologist convinced, "Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it'll be my blow."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained to her that a wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it really open and the symbolic one is a scar".
The protagonist sighed gently and concluded that "she was only able to learn so much about the wound that she is really open and that she does not exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand together.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicoragujec Sergio Ramírez also performed with a delightful narrative, which he called Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but will appear at one point.
with the elements of magical realism she tells about the famous witch who played clouds, bringing back the people who had gone far away, or correcting the virtue lost by one virgin, this story, which then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers, who had told it, are quoted here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes exaggeration in the narrative of conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (the writer), mocked the fictional testimony presented in stories as real, but in other ways never managed to tell the story of America with such imagination that even lacked shame".
However, he emphasized, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and just where reality and lie are blended, where no longer known, which of the story belongs to one group and what of the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
That's what he calls a "cervant tradition".
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Mayra Monter then emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its discussion Finger into the wound enabled.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence going through her country - and shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise, which is obviously not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is a communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical response".
The evening was closed by Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciousness, which overflows with dogmatism, it is forgotten that "there is a small no behind every appearance, and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be masters of our ideas and realities we must color: and to color means to put a finger in the wound many times and to harass those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without discoloration, and to harass the authorities that prefer this black and white world", he said to support the sense of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has experienced both good and bad during his career, but he has already achieved it on three occasions for the decisive series.
In a duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finals, two different styles will also clash with their techniques, teams that have a distinct difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has experienced both good and bad during his career, but he managed to achieve it already on three occasions for the decisive series, but until now he left with the undone, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
Argentinian had to settle for the silver medal, stay one step behind the winners and play curiously with the same team the following finals.
As a coach, the Santist Strategist made it to his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had morelia club reins, with which he fell 4-2 against Toluka; then again in the Clausura 2003 tournament he advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it to the overall score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Seniors" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - kl.) after 210 minutes of the game undecided 2-2, after a series of penalty shootings he got to the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed 11 steps and the team suffered a turn to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I owe, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is most important," said the coach when he was asked about the numbers that speak against him in the finals.
in a vivid memory he has a previous final in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned a lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we learned a lesson in this, until the match is over, we can't celebrate."
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: "You never try to make a series of penalty kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were ready, unfortunately fate has prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left something in us and hopefully this time something like this will not happen".

The United States is amending the rules on issuing visas
People will have to contact the Centres of the Services for visa applicants before an interview at the Consular Department; costs will be lower and waiting times will be shortened.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa consultation process at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Centres of the Services for Visa Applicants (abbreviated from English ASC) prior to an interview at the Consular Department.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer a fee will be paid for the agreement of the meeting, the second for processing the application and more for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary workers’ visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consulate Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra $26 service fee.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The American Space Agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aviation and Space Bureau (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, dissemination and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured itself that she would present a "discovery that would cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life", arousing speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are, besides us, other creatures living under inhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that they will eventually become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemist National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere of what it is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another, second life form, different from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the true reach of discovery at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", they claim.
The 60th parliamentary period was not even started when the opposition block was established in Congress, led by the members of the PRD (Partido de la Revolution Democratica, Czech "Page of Democratic Revolution", PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Work Party", Convergencia (Czech "Concordance" Note), and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalv, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the House.
Prior to the opening of the 60th parliamentary term of Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patron Montalvo "sined" against reform of the Constitutional Law, because he is excluding them.
This reform, they repeated, begins with "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santosova Aquilarova, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - c.p.) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form political marginality from the impulse of PRI parties (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institution Party") and PAN.
He stated that, over the next few days, they would talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on political will, and if they did not, they would again be subjected to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"When she got here (opposition coalitions), I'm looking at it because we're out of any decision, they're not even willing to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, by Convergence, said that they agree with PRD, PT, and Patron, so they will form a pluralistic group.
It is not possible to allow Congress to continue to be "duopolistic" after being monopolistic.
The aspiration of law reform is not to have infinite bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues to gain more votes, as added by Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, by PT, explained that Congress has now become a "pretty" of two - in reference to PAN and PRI.
"Before it was controlled by only one party, today it is divided by two."
Patron Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"To make sure that five of us, who are likely to be nine, but who now see us as five, do not stay out of the way because of archaic agreements, each in a different faction, we are united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed, we stand out, and we disagree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos are issued for "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlan will pay another check discussed to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent by city hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camache Palazuelos.
The sum paid in this second semester to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial will climb to 1.200.000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, it was exhibited on the amount of 200.144,56 pesos and its subject was referred to as "the settlement of outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for high-price sales, another sum.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent for Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Bill, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the High State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasurer assured that she had not reused the services of the City Hall contractor.
in the previous period, after 25 July, Noroeste published a revision of the cheques issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camachová Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the bad condition of the Sánchez Taboada show in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the pit at the Sánchez Taboada party, the tourist sector in Mazatlan asks the authorities to pay attention to the areas and places that are in poor condition and do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to shut down a business for one day, and they have no idea of the revenues that are escaping, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these matters for so long and without proper planning".
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The city hall will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to do preventive maintenance, not just repair existing defects", he said.
We would like to enjoy clean cities, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because we deserve a clean residence as residents, the town hall should change its city maintenance strategy".
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito.
"Today, in order for tourists to arrive, it is not just about promotion that we need to offer a good product, a city that is abounding with the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is missing.
He spoke of a number of places that need to be fixed in cooperation with the town hall, saying that priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to make it attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural objectives and space, but it will be necessary to fix these places first so that we can make them more attractive and put them on the list we have for the promotion of this destination".
The IP is asking Congress for results.
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary period of full dignity and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive calls for the business sector in Mazatlán because Sinaloa is convulsing and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and the last from PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and Patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example for a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their rights, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions".
That is why he spoke about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridging to move the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do decent work and, above all, be committed to society and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of trust in the past elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to collect all the strength to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will promote job creation in a certain way".
As far as tourism is concerned, he asked the new legislators to give him more weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate in view of the fact that it is an important economic activity, which brings value and investment, which, moreover, competes directly with agriculture".
In addition to issuing funds for start-up tourism projects, Congress should help the state deliver security and help with an alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for Three Kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles are along with other toys on the list of wishes of children in the family of Coronado's Valenzuel.
Their parents will find it difficult to fulfill their ideas about the coming festival of the Three Kings, since their household has exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan, and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar, and Balthazar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time, because my husband is unlucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I get along with "cubbies" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wishes a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he would have wanted a monster car for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana would have wanted clothes of a size of one year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo) 'I wish this monster car', but I said to him 'We'll see son' because it was very expensive', remembers the sadness of Cayetan.
For older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, age 11, is a size 12, 10-year-old Isaiah, size 10, whereas eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing sneakers, so he could really use a five and a half or six pair.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the family of Coronad Valenzuel, you can participate in the campaign "Trice Kings Wanted", and bring a gift or cash to the reception desk of Noroeste.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
Ten tours were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, in the framework of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford, and Stoke, mostly in places used to produce drugs.
"Nearly 750 beds of Indian cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used to produce was confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Quebec police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, both suspected bosses of this entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
Arrested persons must have arrived at the justice palace in Sherbrook following their arrest.
They could face accusations of the production of Indian cannabis, its possession with the aim of trading with it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public that enabled us to proceed with these arrests," said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers from the regional section of the investigation of the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The bill of conservatives, which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be overpowered while all three opposition parties on Wednesday have said that they cannot support it.
"I rely to a significant degree on the Charter."
"I stand directly on the side of the party, which built granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after a weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow the detention of up to one year of any person coming from a ship, identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebek Blok, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he could not support the bill because he was heading towards a bad goal.
"We are against, and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
On the issue of immigration, the NPD critic, Olivia Chow, rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough in terms of illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree that we should take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider a substantial part of another draft law, C-35", said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and places children in prison for at least one year", explained Mrs Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians are mass telling Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada's shot at and treat it like some kind of creep."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to vote to reject it.
At the same time, a conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote to be held by every opposing Member in his position in front of his constituents.
New Unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigation committee for the issue in question.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, strives to ensure that this idea does not go into oblivion: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Investigation from New York as early as January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That is why Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
There was no need for more for public security critics, PQ Stephane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as "the king pulled out of the hat" and "the amateur solution botched on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself answered those who fear that political power has too much influence on the potential future of unity.
"It will be satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting-up of witnesses in a public hearing.
"Moreover, Mr Charest is affirming that he does not want to create this investigation committee, and people think, as you and I do, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only means to achieve the creation of an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Officials.
In order to emerge from this impasse, he suggested that Quebec be given special authority to the inspector-general to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General", he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the Commissioner, who is allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of the Charest government.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code, so that it would be better adapted for this type of crime.
This request would be based on the agent for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marco Fournier that the case-law of this kind of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Then Ottawa made changes to the Gangsta Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several waterways have been under strict control due to severe rainfalls that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius, Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated preventively.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's bent.
Several regions hit heavy rainfall from Tuesday to Wednesday in the evening, i.e. rained from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters was not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were hit the most.
It could fall a total of 100 millimeters.
If we add these precipitation with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of floods in some watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Rescue Service announced a warning of the danger of floods for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood alerts and continuous controls.
In the area of de Lanaudière caused severe precipitation of the distribution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated preventively.
In Outaouais spilling some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency services are on alert and overseeing the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued a warning in the middle of severe floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements on social aid and Haitians and, as well as gross speech during broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI group of 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "unaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative representation of Haitians by gross language which does not correspond to broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the transmission of the names of both persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Social Support recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must submit reliable information, not deceptive information.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
The majority of the members of the Commission concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide could not be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the controversial episodes of "Dupont Midday News" broadcast have come across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no complaint against him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stephane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went into a media shootout that triggered many reactions.
Moderator CHOI stated that he did not send any donations to help the Haitians, because we cannot know for sure that the needy will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already redeemed my three-day delay on that thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," said the host.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross language in broadcasting.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast cooperated "over and above its obligations".
For a station which will, inter alia, have to notify such decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special range.
Atlet, which stands out in the "sanda" (Kung-fu "full contact"), in kickbox and Thai boxing enters on tatami and rings all over the world and looks for new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemal, who has lived in the capital since 2008, to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches all over the place, because for those who don't like playing on the ground, which appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this person, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, has just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23 to 30, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won the kickbox categories of full contact and Thai boxing, he said."
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"They were invited by rivals who ended up first four at the last World Cup in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009.
"I finished eighth in '05 in 'Nam."
"In 2007 in China, I ended up in a fifth-morning tournament, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished third, added."
"The interesting thing is, I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline coming from China, where punches and feet, as well as tossing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches take place traditionally on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, born from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
As far as Nacer Zemal is to maintain only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the Supertournay "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains the nice guy."
"It's kind of equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered a loss in the finals.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four competitors on the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that one champion, king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracts without competitions
Hydro-Québec agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important contract, a contract for managing the entire project in total amount of $295 million without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of Énergy gérance, was authorised in 2004 in parallel with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergy gérance" obtained a lucrative contract without any announcement of a tender.
For the Quebec Party, a complaint against a consortium of companies puts us in front of a serious ethical problem, which risks eliminating competition and causes price increases.
"It's a new way to implement the collusion and eliminate the competition."
"This means that people no longer make side deals secretly, now they are doing them openly," said PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked the National Assembly this question because it says that it is hard to bear how public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normanddeau, objected this afternoon, in short, denying that this contract was collusion.
"I have my own way," she thundered and claimed that the PQ was "honest" and "missed accuracy."
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
This is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more businesses to group their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the complexity of the work.
The construction is already running and must be planned by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being possible; it was trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formulation of consortia in the field of engineering consultancy is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly over the trade register of quebeck companies at speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; name CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the Consortium of Énergy gérance, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is typical of the special dynamics of the labor force and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Society Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that would make us look down on the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a tender and if there are few tender participants, your prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: I mean, you take the people who are part of the contract as participants in the competition, and you say, "Let's make a good deal with a good price."
"But the main idea is that it is not the price that matters, but the competence of the people", confirmed Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to Énergy gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verifying Le Devoir counted 109 consultancy contracts in engineering, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin scored 22 contracts, of which Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in the "Energy of Gérance".
All the contracts have been concluded.
They total $449,783,344, including a contract with Énergy gérance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good friends of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normanddeau has released a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance it" before specifying that they are more of its managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer trusts very little in the players of sustainable development, but also in the 'unbiased' marks and environmental certificates, to follow this in the selection of products.
The worst is that, while we bathe in the media universe, which urges us and urges us to consume more socially responsiblely, this media universe laments a lack of credible information, a failure to fulfil obligations that it even qualifies as a brake for its commitment, says Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption increased in 2010 so called socially responsible products, the inhabitants of Quebec who are trying to sell them still don't trust them very much
In fact, two-thirds of us say they don't believe in the promises of companies about the environment, simply because green advertising by companies finds a measuring tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands, which are referred to as environmentally responsible, states Barometer.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this issue is accepted as serious by just 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount in stimulating this aspect of consumption revived at present by almost one third of quebeck consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after a higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebekuse's population is incredulously opposed to the product or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
The whole 61% preferred purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, says Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québek likes to present himself as the king of recycling, who strives for the least impact on the environment by taking care of the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents reported that they were using public transport or that they recommended using the car to drive at least two people in order to protect nature.
Walking and bike also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan to buy the cinema complex eXcentris
The government of Quebec, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The Developper company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and which demonstrated its mission as a film art lover, did not receive what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than an expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would, after all, be lower, some original expectations that could build the basis for viable solutions on favourable terms and with resources from the state.
The first action plan and request for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications were already revised for reductions.
The proposal and plan of action were sent to Minister St-Pierre, President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government counterproposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to reply.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec was opposed to direct investment by the State in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if it did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his cinemas within ten years of financing the building of the complex, which could have been the reason for the change by the financial council of the state.
The lack of halls for independent films is loud in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his lead, runs a campaign to release funds to the private sector, believing that he will be able to spend $700,000 to push through acquisitions.
Since spring 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallel, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and to project the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group think about the proposals for reduction that are being made to him.
Raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic sources of America known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but by the same blow, they reveal their sense of superiority of the latter in relation to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian electorate is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to voting, and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, last night on display to the public, provide additional sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets that political leaders are discussing.
To the great amazement of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins has given several explanations for this situation.
"Canadian inferiority complex, almost permanent, makes possible political leaders conditional on talking about internal betting rather than realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign), writes.
"The United States are therefore," he concluded, "the proverbial elephant in these elections: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to be mentioned."
The ambassador understands this "a deafening silence" even less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government retains its trust vote at the beginning of February regarding the federal budget to which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a 30 to 40 billion dollar recovery plan," says M. Breese.
Nowhere has it been mentioned that the government had to adjourn the Parliament's pre-Christmas session so that it could not be defeated by a coalition and that opposition parties make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to an increasingly negative image that is being thrown on the United States by dramatic series broadcast on the CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there can be not very subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the principle of "case-by-case".
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, State Secretary."
"Secretary accepted to revise the file."
Finally, let us note that the people involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
Word got out, and Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
World lighting recovery plan
Yesterday, in Cancún, the United Nations proposed a plan to restore home lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries in order to achieve a greenhouse effect reduction (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the other restrictions that need to be achieved for the stabilisation of the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult commitments to reduce on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the light bulbs that monopolize up to 50 to 70% of the market, we replace the light bulbs with fluocompact or, even better, with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would break off.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of the car park emissions on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, were involved in voluntary reduction plans that should allow GES global emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve climate stabilisation at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be ruled out that it will not get out of control.
In heated bulbs 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs can withstand an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, the ones that Philips introduced this week - this company allegedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations about fluocompact light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless producers set up collection plants.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact bulb, but rather a thermal coal power plant that emits much mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, 25,000 tons of mercury per year are put into circulation by these headquarters.
The report also details the profits that any country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year to buy electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to a 3.5 thermal power plant whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadline set.
"The Secretary-General emphasises the need for an independent election committee to complete its work and immediately announce preliminary results, stressing the UN President's spokesman."
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from taking any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the election committee allowed the final date - Wednesday midnight - to expire three days after Sunday's scrutinium.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the president of CEI confirmed on TV that the committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the challenges of CEI finally being named second-round winner, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and a member of the opposition, Alassan Ouattara, have increased throughout the world.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "false" vote in the north, administered by former New Army insurgents (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, president of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, has confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation by voters practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have discouraged the supporters of the President of Côte d'Ivoire from voting.
Elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council had taken into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
But the opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral, because Paul Yao'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo, is in charge of it.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who dements any connection with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered a loss and that it would be illegal to file a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from transmitting the results.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided into two halves for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations pointed out to the political faction of Côte d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, October 31, as a winner with 38% of the votes compared to 32% for Alassana Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in Metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional data with seasonal deviation correction (CVS) published on Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed has settled at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but wish to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of current young people on the labour market has increased with a new increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
As for the elderly, in metropolitan France, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), i.e. 482,000 people from 50 years up and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only populations aged 25-49 have benefited from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy about its method of calculation.
Eurostat, a European Union statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday the rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and taken into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation in the matter of public procurement, deemed fraudulently acquired.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of misuse of the company's assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, provision of bribes, acceptance of bribes for the purpose of influencing the office and possession of ammunition, states his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists that he and the judge explain to each other all the questions he intends to ask him, not some delusions."
"It is easy to persecute him for many criminal reasons, but the other thing is to prove them," said his attorney, Florence Rault, before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini, through his lawyers, said that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but ensure the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
With regard to the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of such a thing, said Mr Simon.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former CEO of Aubagne's agglomeration service, was charged on Wednesday with misuse of public funds and conspiracy, and let loose, under judicial supervision, of the banning, of the protagonists of the matter.
"My client has been able to give an explanation for all the facts he is accused of."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and leaves it at large," said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released on Tuesday night on Wednesday, with being court-supervised for two of them, said Deputy District Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for taking bribes to influence the Office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for the "disposal and abuse of the company's assets", the other for the "competition in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, a business associate of Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "covering up abuse of the company's assets".
Among the people confronted by Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been charged with a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were helping to launder money from large-scale gangsterism.
The investigation is conducted in several open judicial investigations against the X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular on waste matters.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses mainly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille City Community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysian Palace exaggerated the mediation of Syria
In more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the work of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "spymony", united views in France, put diplomacy on the alert and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this was closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and a wanted U.S. justice for the fraudulent trafficking of material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they are subjecting sharp light to the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything about it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline: "Iran:French comments on how to deal with hostages".
Adviser from the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for the North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking with the representative of American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They encourage Americans to do just as much for being brought back to their homeland by their own nationals by the violence held in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "keep on saying in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocent", "immediate deliverance".
It is necessary to bring into trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, 'silence will not solve anything', the Iranians are 'a masters of evasive maneuvers'.
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
It announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day when the French Embassy will provide her with sanctuary) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (a deposit of EUR 230 000).
And they will announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will escalate".
The Iranians could "in the future arrest about 1800 more French living in Iran", he states.
August 28th, 2009.
Clotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spreading: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
Like many observers, the American Embassy is asking questions about this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, who pursues illegal Iranian networks to gather nuclear material, the expansion of Majida Khakavanda is bad news.
France has agreed to a bargain?
Freeing an Iranian for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysian palace, as it states, was not only "surprised by this judge's decision," but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There have been talks between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the decision of the court", notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Advisor of the Elysée Palace dials the telephone number, hangs up the phone headphone and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Paris's buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy".
At the time of the imprisonment of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysian Palace is making efforts, negotiating through communications and organised "runs" to the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "affects" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and say that manipulation bears fruit, because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blest" of French officials.
On what is the basis of such "gratefulness" expressed against M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements, full lauding French officials acknowledge in private that they have only vague ideas of what the Syrians actually did".
The document deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communication "directs to validate President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", analyses.
The policy applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate Syria, what praisers can earn by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to 'sow a grain of discord between Syria and Iran'.
The U.S. embassy knows from a very good source.
August 11th, François Richier confided in him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we still thanked them."
"This should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among Iranians".
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is receiving her at the Elysian Palace.
In the communique thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our countrywoman".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival", which will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, said responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16, reported representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have problems learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", said Jo Rin, head of the Ministry, who is in charge of the draft law.
Online games will be newly accessed from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, to specify.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit their daily time of access to these young games, whose parents so request, to supplement the responsible worker.
It will also make free programmes available to people who so request, allowing time spent on the Internet to be limited.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries, and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: Fife sets up host countries.
Full unrest over suspicion of corruption is set up by the Executive Committee of Fifa on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a selection of sovereignly politically motivated, where the struggle for influence and lobbying risks overcoming technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the royal competition Fifa in 2018 will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to succeed in conquering new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere of the African continent in 2010, or continue to join the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities participating in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives you the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to candidates.
According to the evaluation report Fife documentation English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not be of too great importance to 22 members of the Executive Commission at an hour to vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the unveiling, leading to suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of its country, the cradle of football, which so far hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
On Monday, the BBC gave it the crown when it broadcasts a document that "pushed on a pin" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayataou.
How to make Fif unhappy and bring into trouble the English leader with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will succeed in repeating the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to win the Olympic Games organization for London in 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
There is nothing less certain, because the Spanish-Portugal couple do not miss the trumps of the already prepared stadiums, its adventures (the 1982 World Championship in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin has decided that the Championships will not be relocated to Zurich and has publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal innuendo hardly distorted on accusations by the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite with its considerable experience in 1994.
The highest performance of the world economy, the headquarters of the major sponsors of Fif, seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacys seem premature for both countries who had a 'test' together in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which bitterly desires Fif, has made Asian chances invalid for 2022.
With Qatar, who pulled a big ace out of his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new lands, but these two countries represent more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for poor TV fees (due to a time shift) paid by European countries, creating a driving force for Fif.
Second mandate: clarity (security)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand made it seem he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
The Elysian Palace's mandate calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secrets associated with the Presidency's office.
So it must be done as if doubts persist.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that the third mandate should not be excluded.
On 15 November, with the serious expression Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "it will be decided sometime in autumn 2011".
As the members of the UMP Parliament recall on Wednesday evening at the Elysian Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown little feverish state.
Was that an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement from him, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he recalls such meetings in the humorous tone of the presidential election.
"At worst, or best, you have seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he switched in July 2009.
Rebelia in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His earlier statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make him a candidate any less.
If they make comments, it is because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to the colt of Ségolène Royal pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict.
On the contrary, it is because its candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to arrange for battle formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s candidacy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the UMP issue," the people from the nearest vicinity of the Prime Minister responded immediately and suspiciously.
"If he believes possible defeat, he will not run", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, even with the obvious.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council in the year should have been an opportunity to specify the conditions for the discharge of the crisis or, at least, a notification of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which must be completed by the end of this year.
The sovereign European debt crisis will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorically under threat of worsening the situation now already tense on European securities markets.
In such a case, the political price would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in order to address the European states' debt crisis.
She did not want to say if she thought that the bank could do more, for example by increasing their program of purchasing sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)".
The evening before that, in Brussels, when questioned by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not proved to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and he was satisfied with the fact that he stated that the secondary market purchase programme "continues" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting that takes place this Thursday.
The only certainty: Central European Bank will monitor its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases from the central European bank’s treasury bonds have doubled to almost EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unreasonableness of the market accordors, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, central banks have purchased the eurosystem for €67 billion since May 2010.
Among the brokers on the anticipation market, there is no doubt about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change in course.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank’s arsenal, this latter bank shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generous conditions and for a period of between one week and three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of causing short-term new tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist Commerzbank.
"Progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", prejudges Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions on the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the purchase volume of its bonds to revive the weak market", adds Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs at all costs to replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performance by the states among the most fragile", testified yesterday to a major bond manager.
Because if interest rates were to take off, the countries would be more worried about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi’s government burrows its back
After the start of the week for Italy worrying, the situation became a little relaxed, yesterday with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs of the Regions, they said that they heard Giulia Tremonti qualify the situation as 'unsolvable' and that he expected an 'unforeseeable' weekend, which he then demented the participants.
In any event, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points and the price of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) went up to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with the "roaring development of markets" and a possible disease from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and the lack of clear fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the general government deficit will represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (compared to 3.9% of the government envisaged) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From there, a reputation for a new summary of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken", says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund Board under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, the NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the efforts required from other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face up to the motion for a censure of the Chamber of Deputies, and then the elections that will be envisaged at the end of March could begin to be organised.
This would start a period, little suitable for taking decisions in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde pointed it out again yesterday in the press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans demonstrated it on Sundays throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solid determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, regarding interest on European state bonds, has brought water to the mill for governments and the Central Bank of Europe.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Office for Notation Standard & Poor's announced that it could degrade the record of Portugal's debt, a goal that is most focused on various speculations.
"Because in May, the real policy is insufficiently transparent and obvious, mainly based on banking systems," says economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so that "political time runs slower than market time".
With this interrupted link and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying the debates aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected problem, and on a wider scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
With regard to Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroupe) and Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The Central European Bank is meeting today.
The agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, refused to travel around Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this path is not aimed at raising funds, it will certainly pave its way towards achieving this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, the US official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
First of all, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid, other than Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, both countries want to avoid asking for international aid before applying their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on structural reforms necessary to regain lasting trust.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalisation of sovereign bonds markets.
On his journey to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that EUR 750 billion, mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, would not hesitate to touch the stock again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, an actor of the very first trading plan for European sovereign claims, consider that an addition of about EUR 100 billion would suffice, "more preferable" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
There is a means: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized by EUR 60 billion on this date.
A Council that has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 regions have an orange alert.
Snow rations still cause difficulties in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties now have an orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Lair, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined 20 counties that already have announced an orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France considerable snowflows cause problems in the north of la Gironde and the forest Charentes and it snows weakly on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and cover from 1 to 3 cm, from 5 to 5 in the region of Paris.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Inflows of snow are large enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned heavy freight transport - trucks over 7.5 tonnes with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and police recommend leaving with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Picardia, school connections were banned for Thursday.
No special measures to limit freight transport are foreseen on Wednesday evening.
The District Office "calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt driving to the nature of the road".
The DGAC requested airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on Thursday at Roissy Airport in Paris and 10% at Orly due to expected snowflows.
DGAC recommends connecting passengers using air transport services with their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernising transport to Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has rained billions.
At least during the discussion.
We are especially reminded of the 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the State announced the grant of EUR 4 billion.
It is theoretically an amount that will then allow SGP to apply part of its funding from its double source to the contracts.
Today we are finally getting to the first amendments.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which examines the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
First, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The income from this interest is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists so as to "to be modernised, to increase the yield obtained from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
A mirage.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're a long way from $4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are added to EUR 4 billion from the capital subsidy, which will be mobilised by the State and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us at SGP.
"From the moment we created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then go up to 4 billion, it explains."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary".
SGP considers that the 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised belong to the absent beneficiaries, risks causing a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and complicit spies
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and it anticipates a future controlled by regression.
But let's go first.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm that every document drawn up by the secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" of Americans about the way Berlusconi's sex life is announced by what everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all except these two Berlusconi owns), and the infamous cartoon profile of Kadafi has long been a theme for cabaret artists for sketches.
The rule that secret documents may consist only of news already known is fundamental in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Temples or Walls) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (he doesn't even know where to look for news about non-existent ones), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret service (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be an editor in Libération), who considers only what he admits to be true.
The high-security information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the State Department was the same information Newsweek published the week before.
Why, then, has there been so much fuss about the discovery of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can make a call or take an airplane to a dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few little exercises in the representation, have transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching movies about an investigation knows very well that it seems to be ignored out of the least bit of laziness.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly defamates the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most heavily classified information of the most powerful country in the world represents a hard blow, not an unmissable one, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and his "executors".
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to hold all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since, thanks to the ability to control every move through the phone, every transaction done, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, became a citizen of the complete victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even "graves" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the hack's intervention, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker, elected to avenge a citizen, may know all the secrets of power.
How can he maintain a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is an unencumbered secret (and an unencumbered secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, unencumbered secret, because it is pulled out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was an unencumbered secret, means taking away all power from it.
WikiLeaks made no mistake about Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the mighty so great?
Obviously, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would be equal to its publication on a poster posted on the corner of the street.
But it's also quite obvious that with current technology, it's useless to hope that you can keep the message secret over the phone.
There is nothing easier than finding out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of her colleagues.
How will private and sensitive reports be kept secret in the future?
I know my prognosis is science fiction for the moment, and it's fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials transporting themselves discreetly to carry out formalities on uncontrollable routes and carrying only those messages that they know by heart, or rather hiding precious information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in drawers sealed by a key: all in all, the attempt to espionage in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, which means backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) enabled cinema lovers to capture film step by step, move it forward and backwards and reveal all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow to jump through chapters, that is, macro-proportions.
By means of fast trains, we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while travelling by plane and transport, which involves three and a half hours.
So it is not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques return to horses-drawn vehicles.
One last comment.
Other times, the press tried to understand what had been plotted in secret by the embassy.
They are now embassies asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its promises on funding
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to test compliance with promises for quickly unblocked financing (said quick start funding or premature start funding), carried out by developed countries.
And the big French hacks have been exposed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries undertook to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (that is €420 million a year).
At the start of COP16, the EU drew a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report specifying the action of its Member States, press conference, grand side event, distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation priceless and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would want all developed countries and civil society to do them in the same way and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it on the right track to keep its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is realised without harming the development aid.
Unfortunately, there's no match for what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for three years to the title of fast start funding.
Other countries have selected similar references with annual payment dates or with dates at the level of public development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the overall amount of support from France to developing countries may remain constant (or even decrease) to honour its commitment to financing "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There is not yet a rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that €1 borrowed equals €1 to be donated.
Clearly, it is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be evidenced for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission reduction, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not see it as the basis of our commitments, but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the interest rate equivalent).
But France can only make such a statement: 'respects' its commitment of EUR 420 million, making it 91.5% loan (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% of it, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 to satisfy its promise, France only gives 10 centimetres and considers this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful conjurer's piece!
To summarise, France operates with double fraud in its financing of fast start: on the one hand, with the development of the share over time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it only spends EUR 36.1 million, it can convince itself that it issues EUR 420 million 'new and additional' in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when it is enough to lend?) and when negotiating, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early funding is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw on the findings of this first year of early funding.
First, France should notify the change in its way of keeping accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and decency and justice vis-à-vis other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing contributions to long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of 'additionality' or how to account for loans.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive with these deposits as with others.
So everyone is putting hope into the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Koscius-Morizet, who will be arriving in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could raise the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in discussions.
A pesticide alarm that children eat.
A ten-year-old child eats 81 different chemicals one day, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-The Movement for Rights and the Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "do not have significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processing issue", bought food commonly consumed in four meals between July and September and one light meal as a light snack for one child about ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sugar confectionery, have been analysed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to glands with internal excretion (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we can well see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminating substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking", says the Association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain about ten roids with potential carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicidal agent in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, ground meat steak, canned tuna, and even bagels and gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the tap analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even analysis of the plastic plate used to warm up the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "contaminant cocktail" is probably underestimated", results from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greening Association (EE-LV) has proposed "to face an emergency" to set up a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the "growth of civilizational diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
