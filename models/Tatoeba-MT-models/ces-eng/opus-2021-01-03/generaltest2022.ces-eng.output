The great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Frenchman was called to the NHL
The Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Frenchman, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
Thirty-one-year-old Pilsner native will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
Former goaltender Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He took turns in the middle of the game with Vegas and has not yet introduced himself at the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to another.
"Pavel French will be out for approximately three to four weeks with injuries in the lower body," he announced the whole of Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to goal in the NHL eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time was called from a farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL he added 94.5% of the procedures.
The Pilsner hockey progeny wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the world's greatest league.
He had problems with hips in his senior year and did not catch a single match in his shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL “France” caught 36 games, his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on his Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose as this year’s Christmas card a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, who used a photograph in which his wife Camille helped to put on a mask at the races.
On its website, the British BBC news station reported this.
Wishes are sent to friends, coworkers and foundations that they work with.
The photograph was created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just like Prince George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate didn't mention it, it's not even clear exactly when it came into existence.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their rural mansion in Norfolk County.
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla also published a picture that will serve as a Christmas card.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who wears a top hat and a mask on her face, helps Camille put on her mask in colour matching her light dress.
Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, according to efotbal.cz, he denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accused former Vice-Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have promised a million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed efotbal.cz that he had access to a part of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club Jaroslav Třitík said that they did not commit any corruption by red and white.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia is mainly represented by its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red and white official was in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the second league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoznica, who is also in the case among the accused.
Criminalists reportedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berbr a financial reward for winning his degree.
2019 team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should have a promised million-dollar bribe for winning the league from SK Slavia Prague officials, quoting the server from the file.
A day later, according to the CSIs, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Slavia Třitík.
According to the server, the file no longer indicates whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He refused to commit any kind of corruption.
From 2015 to 2017 we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees contrary to fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," he said.
In response, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former players of Slavia's dark skin and also slanders his former boss, Třitík.
Last mid-October, a police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of FAČR, triggered the case of alleged influence of matches through referees.
The highest ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer works in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, just like former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoznica was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but basically worse type (the cannons must be from the armored cabin and carry the cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition they managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the lease, traffic - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a wank right next to the city.
There were nutria climbing from the river, and they were doing crop damage, so I sat there.
When I came in, I saw there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down and I guess the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before anything came out, but, of course, there was a fox in the moment.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his forehead all over the place, so I called on him to say it was a fox.
By the time I got off the horse, he was gone.
Even a meadow can be a jerk.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably see in the thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, expensive things take you to your feet in a spacecak and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Home got respirators considerably cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to coronavir, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts to the respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities acted economically?
And why did others buy bulwark?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to the server editor and Rozhlas Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate soldiers and armies (I don't think I'm affected by the memories of ČSLA, which have been experienced by older generations), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large storerooms of techniques that can take up training, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is still more complicated, so the ability of reservists will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition to modern conventional conflicts, where they can be deployed, they will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defenses are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrillas and it is also a stated necessity to deter the enemy.
There will only be a fight on the territory of the Czech Republic in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where geriatrics will be irrelevant, and we do not have an appropriate geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have it.
Then there's this situation where you're looking like a dude who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, goes into an attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you're like, "You know, what do you think's gonna happen?"
Well, of course he'll be ripped off like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "inducing a defenseman" is so terrible that I find myself honestly surprised to see our attacker can play one player's opponent.
First swallows
Covid’s pandemic is slowing down, but experts for the next few weeks are not expecting a major twist.
The strain in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-stinfect immunity obtained from previous illness is helping against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral of molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, reducing the risk of severe illness and associated hospitalization by one third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented with paxlovid from Pfizer, which has reported a success rate of 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, apart from the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As has been said, the first to reach domestic patients is molnupiravir by Merck.
The company ended up on tape first because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for equine viral disease in the South American continent.
This research often ignores the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying 'how our beak has grown'.
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will tell you that they are not.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and they vote sides like AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying that in public means losing his job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they're really gonna find out what people are thinking.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the spinning of the units, so that the soldiers don't have to learn where everything is again, so all objects on the hair are the same.
One of them is the Atom Brdy Museum, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that sssr didn't want to have a nuclear warhead in its own territory, either because of the safety or the speed of deployment of warheads due to the wester position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads were kept, not the entire rockets, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived to pick up this warhead and install it on some kind of carrier device.
Besides the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolation state.
We had a classmate at the second grade of primary school, Cigan, and we were with him for four years.
He was kind of cool, making good jokes, showing up a lot, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, often went out and wanted to explain something, missed a few, walked regularly, took sports with us, did not steal snacks, or telephones, walked cleanly.
He used to go to schools in nature, he did all kinds of monkey shit, but he was fine, hopefully never any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings, fags joined the same class, other classes.
Shortly thereafter, a teacher was beaten up, often handled by the police, threatened and threatened by other students.
I personally sell something for an ad (old things, something I don't need etc.) and I've often sold to the Cigans, they always had money, they didn't try to draw me to price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, a guy called in a month and said he'd already signed it over.
I say I'm not racist myself, I don't care if anyone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave in a decent society as they belong (working, working, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, they reach out, they live in apartments and houses, they just mess around, they make trouble... no matter what color it is, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start doing business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatick
"The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, unfortunately, despite the CPR, she succumbed to her injuries on the spot," said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemian paramedics.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
Eighteen-year-old Peugeot driver probably drove in the direction of the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and from yet undetected causes drove in a turn in the opposite direction.
After the collision with Škoda Octavia ended the Peugeot vehicle on the roof off the road, Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident as a spokesperson for the South Bohemian police.
A young Peugot driver suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
There were multiple injuries, and he remained incarcerated in the wagon.
After the rescue he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was transported by air to the Czech Budejovice hospital, said the rescue woman Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mostly getting collectibles.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," says the collector.
Since October, the ordering of small shipments has been slightly expensive, newly it must add VAT and post office data to the customs procedure.
He'll get an e-mail saying the customs are expecting a package.
All you have to do is fill in the details of the consignment, and if VAT has not already been included by the trader on the sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide the customs procedure itself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna click one or two keypads, put in two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments, however, manage to deliver smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, daily arrivals from abroad from 60,000 to 15,000 fell to the international post office in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the calls for the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments to be processed at the international post office.
If people had filled out all the data they needed and filled in on time, we would have been here about half the time, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation Solutions
See the headline, how would you suggest addressing current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation, and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down this growth or compensate?
We see, for example, in Poland, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices go up faster than wages, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business that I operate during my job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are only sent to prison for six months?
This just doesn't take my mind off how a court can only put an animal like that behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Isn't that a deterrent to a potential future rape report?
The man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kosttomlat
The Grave Man inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationwide wanted friend from Kostomlat, on whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to her.
But he went around the corner.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he was robbed.
Officers arrived on the scene after calling 911 and were not surprised when the alleged "stealed" told them that he had invented everything to get the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted person list, in a nationwide search, and was given an arrest warrant.
The case is therefore solved by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with mem, too bad Churchill failed to ensure the liberation of Prague USA :)
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually trust something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world if I'm not mistaken, about 10,000 different religions.
Which god or gods should man choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that there's at least one god in one of those thousands of religions that will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments, there is no god but Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to abstain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong ones from the thousands of gods, and the one true god I just missed will send me to hell or some other place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months of one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: The cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly falling apart, companies are hunting in schools and there is some kind of interlinking, when labour migrates from educational institutions into working conditions.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, a German or a Mongolian raider will never come here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved in stone, we have allies, and they'll defend us if there's trouble.
Oh, my God.
One election in the U.S. that cuts their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown up once that all they have to do is show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works for the long term as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that can control the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled resources, so what can't be done?
We don't need border fortifications, that's bullshit today, but a playful teenager behind a stick of remote control can handle it.
How to Not Drown In a Boxed Tsunami
You open the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home packed with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is once again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
A map of the shops that will welcome your used boxes has therefore been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can bring a cardboard box, plastic or paper filler to the connected store (the map of KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently scarce in the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
Moreover, in the eyes of eco-minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, producer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
The boxes and filler material are brought to Popůvky near Brno by individuals who collect themselves at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have scheduled regular collection of discarded cartons.
We'll use everything to pack shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are together creating a more considerate world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from the household, where to hand in expired medicines, tires, retired electro, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"The collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise unnecessarily become waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Učliďme Česko association.
I find it rather wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and stupidly resistant that children who use computers or phones play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
A problem has recently emerged (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
They can use technology from childhood, but they can learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron introduced the priorities of the French EU Presidency before the weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour, during which he revealed the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and voters like it.
Macron's supporters of the gap between the right and the left agree on a little, but Europe does.
And there will be a new election of the head of state in France in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is prepared to create conditions for such a work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise Macron's pro-European propaganda and rewrote history.
In fact, they're trying to defend the rewriting of history.
The far right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now driving around France with the idea that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for one history book seriously, and let's not look at what's going on in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are learning history as a story we versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they'll never know what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won the award for directing and for the best actress Jasna Duričová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he held on to the top of the spectator's rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the movie Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu and being pissed off for a couple of days, and I didn't feel much like smoking...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea in flu.
(Only a personal experience. I'm not saying they all have it that way)

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to spend their lives together.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carrier will change
From Sunday, trains start to ride on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of ČD, RegioJet starts to travel.
For most lines, only the time of departure or their route will be adjusted slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets in the autumn.
ČD plans to broadcast on average 6783 passenger transport connections daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel about 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the national connections within the new timetable, the routes will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main innovation will be the InterJet trains, which will ride on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be sent by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices from next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
The runways take into account inflation in their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entrance to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Cologne.
The carrier will replace České dráhy after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
On a daily basis, RegioJet will broadcast a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, despite planned exclusion work, the carrier tried to maintain as similar driving times as possible for its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged in some regional lines.
The changes await passengers, for example, in Českélipsko, where trains from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be used instead of ČD by Trilex trains from the German company Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will also be able to use uniform rail fares for the second year.
As with ČD, their price will increase by 3.2 percent inflation.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the look of the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were, and they had to work, they died.
I've never heard of teaching from the slave side or from that time, no one defends this, just condemns it.
No one will even tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one at school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, all they'll tell you is how brutally we Europeans killed them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the U.S., directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I did not see anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I have heard it happen before, and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example in Japan the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it's just who they are, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from back then.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, while we're at the Southern states, yes, the Confederate Flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they too had some good successes and I found it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people today idealize it.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in the South were slavers, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately leaving out some facts, lying and manipulating, and maybe our view doesn't exist with them (YT also had a video on TV, where they turned out someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found funny in the US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I felt that at some universities it was terrible, those students were pretty radicalized, and those schools supported them many times.
And if I imagine that these people are going to be much older someday, then I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because it's among the young, and it's in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it had, and it's not about the same, has been radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT themselves, and it leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't met anyone judging me for colonialism or slavery.
More like I met with bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, overall, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If there's a connection between me and people, it's the interests, the views of the world, and the shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not religious, but for all I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he's preaching more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some shit about the coronavirus that everyone's shy.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they're Protestants, but they're actually born from Catholic modernity and they're actually Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to Hussite worship because it's a lot theologically similar, but members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St.Michael on Dominican Square belongs under Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
But the scouts did not go to Vienna this time because of the koronavir pandemic, and in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehemian light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in each year, and I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, told the journalists present, Girl Scout Amalia Alarm clock.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes about the delivery of the flame around the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, 18 December, the scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains will take care of the subsequent light delivery.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take the light at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame around the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year too, scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of coronavirus.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, to try to keep their distances, to do as little as possible, not to sing colleagues, to simply act as safe as possible, to describe the speaker of the Bethlehem light action Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem’s light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
For believers, Bethlehem’s light is a symbol of hope, a light that transcends darkness.
Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The action is based on hundreds of volunteers, the flames are also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including the list of places people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are economic cancer, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will make good use of the money, but I just don't understand why the money is put in agriculture, industry and overall companies.
As mentioned, a useless product is being produced and it breaks down the free market and "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-financed by project xy" labels in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This isn't the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the braking of development where this company is holding back and taking down orders/employees to companies that could grow after it's gone and become more productive.
It's totally okay. It's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in Internet times also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think online advertising is going to move me, but then I find out that they've affected me, too - it's just so crafty that you can't always resist it.
For this reason, too, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to put a total ban on programmematic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I would have banned the Internet.
I have a feeling of this vira ma roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'm going to say it's a covert thinking."
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas films and will present a record of more than two hundred to their viewers this year.
The IMDb film database operator calculated it.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring and significantly increasing audience in recent years, which is why these images are becoming more and more.
This year, there were four times more Christmas films than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their name, so there will actually be much more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are mainly fairy tales associated with this period, worldwide popular are also pictures Alone at home, Love Heavenly or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom of Christmas pictures started only in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came in with a special film series, reminded the BBC server.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station started to tune its viewers for Christmas on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime has 35 new Christmas films on the agenda this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter that much, it's important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows," Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described with exaggeration.
"It is a form of escape for viewers and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years," Gray added.
For example, according to him, Hallmark continues to use the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, will be solved successfully and those two will kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, they complement Gray.

In the last race of the season he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he took out in qualifying.
The Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not reach Abu Dhabi in the end.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only 19 cars will appear on the grid, from the last rung to the line Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively well, according to Haas stables, and shows no symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," their representatives for formula1.com said.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, nor can he.
A substitute would have to be qualified or driven in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first racer.
At the start of the just ending season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were tested positively by Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in my home, sweaters never wore much," says Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work in half a year.
Silk was bought in Italy, 24 carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend to wash.
And there's one more problem.
"I am completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as quickly as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost only 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
The engineers, explorers and drone pilots could launch before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and with the construction of a planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in connection with several months-long actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of the Middle East countries on their territory, with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already working on Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation spreads in the south of Moravia?
Hygiena's looking into another child's case at Adamov.
“We are currently reporting another suspicion of this variant for another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov University is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
"We are waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – performed by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that they were two nurses from one department of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, two 11-year-old students from Adamov University.
There is no connection between cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four with no symptoms.
No one suspected of Omicron traveling abroad
None of them have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, even had contact with anyone who resides abroad.
Link with the water polo championship is none of them, Ciupek said.
The main hygiene lady Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that the international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, is being tested.

California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas for the abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsome announced on Saturday the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous American state, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after detection of the embryo’s heart rate.
People would then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement responded to a Friday’s position by the U.S. Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in force, albeit against the almost 50-year-old precedent verdict, which established the right to abortion across the US in general within about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has not now ruled on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical issue that arises from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was passed on to the public in this case, thereby preventing the Texas Republicans from attacking him by the usual judicial means.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which has allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and has largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the governor of California said.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect people's lives," Newsom continues.
He said that he commissioned his subordinates to work in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would entitle public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is the name of homemade weapons which do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand damages of at least $10,000 (over 220 000 CZK) and court expenses from anyone in California who produces, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts into "weapon of ghosts" or sets for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat to private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the governor of California.
AP notes that California has for decades banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the State would now actually renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, warned of the extension of the legal mechanism to other US states, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not admit full immunity from judicial review to Texas’s abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected officials of the South State.
Each emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where it is gradually coming to terms with what the vaccination schedule will look like, and it also improves the vaccines themselves, based on results.
Israel, for example, has already had a major study of the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other inoculation will have its vaccination schedule after a while, it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should be on the market, which, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the Union budget
According to Zibra, the European Commission would have acted in violation of the law if it had exercised new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing EUR 36 billion from the EU Fund for the reconstruction of the economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemics.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries violating the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail by vetoing all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the Solidarity Poland small party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in Sejóm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in Union energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is illegally denying us the funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish Minister has provided us.
Its party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling party Justice and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes made by the Polish judiciary for Ziobro’s work threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Zibra, Brussels is building “impossible conditions, because its objective is not the rule of law, but the change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw faces “a political dictatorship conducted by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” said Ziobro.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels as to limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland's colony status," he said.
But to know about it... in our country in Lidlo, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk racks I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector, all the cheeses were selected, less common and special, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If it's avoided, I don't go to any market anymore, action non-action, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need and it's got some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidlo to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data like manure being handled here, most of the opponents of vaccination are just a little more off the grid than most of the immunisationists.
While rational debates are taking place at expert level, only extreme opinions get into public space.
Always from wall to wall.
Binary consideration: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
To ban everything, to allow it all.
Colored pies instead of robust analyses.
Matching apples with pears.
This state has it this way, and we have it this way.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states, no one can solve.
Ugh, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outburst, and have a nice day, all of you.
When I was a kid, I was punished with a spoon.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (read instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened that if I did it one more time, I would get hit (even after another "snapping" of the spoon she just brought and laid down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few butt punches (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and extent) are beneficial because the child responds much more to them than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child in a way of choosing whether or not he will obey and receive, or he will improve, and the punishment will not be.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Protection of the system
In 1999, when a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic question about what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether the sacred charter on which he swears and which he learns from his childhood at school or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary was firmly attached to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and better save them from changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, he glossed on the question of Vojtěch Cepl.
More and more recently, however, the opinion among lawyers is that the Constitution needs changes.
For years it has been tested by situations that its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought out.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies face throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of rule of governance, consisting of individual rules that define the policies of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies to bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a several months old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder with children, there are also difficult cases that hospitals have been dealing with most recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, two to five percent are spoken of compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, the New Chief of Medicine of the Department of Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital Brno and of the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are children who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on the ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the department according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease interferes with adults, both adolescents and several months of babies.
In hospitals there are also children in severe condition due to coronavir.
"At present, we have a child of several months and adolescence," said the chief.
He is pleased, however, that no child deaths have yet been recorded in the children's hospital FN Brno.
According to the available data, six children between 0 and 14 years of age were killed in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the cooperation of the psychologist.
It also draws attention to the fact that, as with adults, vaccination reduces the course of the disease in children, while reducing the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"We recommend that you give the vaccine to children," the doctor said.
You can only walk on marked paths in the resting zone.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
You can see them on the tourist map on map.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the resting zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the field).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music is in my head, laughing Josef Kurfiřt.
He was breast-fed by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer he can sing virtually all repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Šalda, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the Wall Philharmonic, with the Film Philharmonic or with the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of a controlled disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Sinologist Jirous: China is building the impression of a controlled disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China has gone on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop the plague that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in the infected.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids, and Chinese doctors are often helping to fight coronavirus, for example, even in Italy’s worst-affected country.
How do you feel about Beijing’s willingness?
Is this friendly support, or is the Communist regime trying to improve their image in the world?
A friend of mine meets a friend and says to him, "Hey, you want an elephant?
I got him, and he's awesome.
My wife likes it because she saves the grass, washes the car with a trunk, kids play with it.
Well, that's just great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
All right, high five, that's gonna be great.
After a while, they meet, and the guy who bought it complains, "Dude, what did you sell for an elephant?"???
The grass is split up, the giant shit everywhere, the car is dissipated, the kids are fighting him, and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold says you're talking about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World events are dominated by great powers.
Although sovereign-state equality is valid, it is the powers that determine the international course of action.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, it works at the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will succeed.
It occurred to me, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm using words.
I just assume that ellipse usually involves 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas it is no longer clear for "Spanish fruit and tangerines" that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated on by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying :D
Either way, it's a pointless request.
There was a five-degree earthquake in Tokyo.
Japan’s metropolis Tokyo and surrounding areas hit an earthquake of 5.0 degrees on Sunday.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey Cosman Milly
Scary footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her down and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwent has now banned her from animal rearing for life, reports The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of the monkeys who care about Milly after her abuse said they've never seen such a frightened cosman before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she's playing happily again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
Four times the mother confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison with a suspended sentence for one year at the court-martial in Gwent.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, she was banned from animal husbandry for life and had to pay CZK 12,000 in court costs.
Team leader Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue. ”
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She was crouching and hiding from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychic abuse scars will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
The abuse of Milla came to light after the Gwent police discovered terrible footage in the woman's phone after the raid in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly swearing vulgarly on the shots.
The next video shows Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) confessed to possession of cocaine with intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found for £1,600 (in excess of 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder's eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months, and Holland got a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from the prehistoric three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
You mean you're gonna take the same things as you did in sixth grade freshman year?
And it all kills the idea of bibbling, where no one, the honor of exceptions, doesn't care if you know it or understand it.
Just take a test for 1, and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can determine the nature of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even scratch it, and they'll tell you they're totally fucked.
Then what the fuck are they learning for?
I'm a big fan of general review, and the fact is, people don't want to, and they don't need to.
And at that point, it's pointless, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's partly learning for the many people who need that thing.
But, like, the note that you really don't need all this to stand by the machine, I meant it completely because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(This is probably what our communist past is involved in and angered against the educated and elites) However, the price of these machines being costing us by barbarians is just high.
I mean, if journalists could count, I don't think covid here has ever reached that level.
Wedding at first sight: The war of Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately," Andrea answered on the instagram in the Stories about curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it's been gnawing since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move to see her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And, as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He was upset with Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Kadri's alleged sincerity now didn't even like his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stand up for her brother publicly.
Normally, I don't express myself at all to this sort of thing, and even in my family, we've never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do this this way, but I'd like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character of himself and helping our family when we needed him most, even though he was young.
I'm all the more sorry to have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would love to know Kadri as much as I do, our loved ones and our family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and we know the reality and we know how it really was, add indefinitely.
A drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Cao started his robbery expedition in a parking lot in a residential area where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he had no better idea than to climb up to the fifth floor and climb into the apartment through an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
The footage from one of the security cameras shows him walking down the street from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner woke up this morning, he found out that the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
That's when Cao was arrested.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day he was indicted.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk has climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is limited in time and effective is bound to a pandemic emergency.

Over 60 percent of the voters came to vote for the councils of four municipalities on Saturdays
The new councils were elected on Saturday in the villages Komňa na Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mostecku, Nová Ves na Liberecku and in Přidná na Pelhřimovku.

A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very monitored election to the Chamber of Deputies were held, said Vice-President Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that because of the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
In the Komni in Hungary, the Saturday elections were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which won 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the gain of two mandates.

75.48 percent of the eligible voters came to the polls.
The Pro Evoká association won in the village of Evoná in Pelhřimov.
It won 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 joined the municipal council.
The vote was 93.62 percent.
The re-election in Lužice on Mosteck was won again by the Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Henry John.

YES received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against the proper elections in 2018, gained more mandate and has three.
The vote was 42.9 percent of the voters.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had raised, how much science suppressed, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-old.
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, where rescue workers intervened in the regional health care services.
The Regional Operations Centre staff received an emergency call one hour after Saturday midnight with initial information about a man’s fall from a height.
Two crews of ZZS – medical and medical – immediately set off.
Upon arriving at the scene, the paramedics found that a 27 - year - old man was to fall from a window about 12 meters [12 m] high and hit his head with concrete!
There was coal in Vítkovice.
But not the way it should be, and the fire department went into action.
At the moment of arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and a direct threat to life.
The interventional physician intubated his airway, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures in pre-hospital emergency care the ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava trauma centre, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned than I am about coronavir because of inadequate reactions by the public and the authorities

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peña managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hadn't found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in lightweight, showed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept away Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise like no one expected.
This brought the women's Bantam Weight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
An American entered a battle with one another as an imaginary "dwarf", for Nunes had not lost for seven years and had brushed her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively and even gave the opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
But Peña did not allow herself to make another mistake, and she unsuccessfully tried to attack her hand with a lever.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Peña put Nunes on the ground where she started strangling her.
She had to give up and knock it off.
So the American woman gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to hit the opponent with a lever.
Although he did not succeed, then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and threw him in a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round Oliveir showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to tap the strangulation.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, on the contrary Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Then he beat him with a series of precise strokes and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical genera, and therefore there is no problem in determining whether it is male, female or middle.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, for which the genus is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two families.
As they bend, they gain double ends and, in some cases, remain in an unrelenting form.
For example, the words "squirrel" or "squirrel" are both male and female, in the first the words are folded according to the pattern of "machine", in the second the words "song".
For another group of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the uniform number, such as: ‘row/line’, ‘keptuben/kedrub’ or ‘potato/potato’ (in terms of food).
Both shapes are in writing, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "curry" in Bohemia and "curry" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similar to other Czech-Moravian two words: "dirge" and "dirge", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have penetrated Czech from other languages were originally inflexible, but gradually take over Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained unrelenting in the middle, but in the male, has endings according to the pattern of "garden".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants who are trying to move on to Europe.
Thousands of people began to go to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise to support Greece, and the Czech Government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to make a uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen blue skies in three months, and we choked, describing a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the countries have to prepare for in the context of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrehel talks to a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's unpleasant for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they're trying to make a reservation.
I don't know anyone personally who's been framed.
But I know a lot of people who were raped, and I've seen how they're often treated by their neighborhoods or even by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up to their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there will be those who falsely accuse someone.
It's gross and spit in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusation is fictional" and that it's "trend" you only help sex offenders.
Czech Republic is flooded with built-up houses, families have no money to finish
Construction material prices have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people got into a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the means to complete the built-up family houses, and the banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already built family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into undeveloped and unconstructed homes.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and the families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rent," says Štěpán Křeček, economist BHS.
We build two or three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of it happened to us.
It is difficult for us as a construction company to keep some things contractually, even if the material has increased.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they're counting on building a house worth $5 million, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think some of them will be waiting," Slivón said.
Copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment were the most undercut by the material.
Construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction fields are missing and the influx of foreign workers is hindering pandemics.
Only the situation with regard to the issue of a building permit is more favourable at the moment.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're fine, and we're gonna be even better.
Real visions are missing, says the commentator CRO – myRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entrance to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, apart from the Prime Minister and Chairman ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, both the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
Like I think my thesis is cool, I have my own topic that I choose, I follow up on my bachelor thesis, I always work on it for a whole year, and then I write a written section in a week or two.
The state statesmen are at peace with us, unless you're a total macaque and something's left in that head, the committee won't smother him with a theory.
For example, I was studying for a week at the state school, and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to lead me on to some logical derivation that came right out and I had it right.
Other than that, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we've done it a lot of times, really beneficial, a lot of learning) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's an exam that shows the knowledge acquired within the project, not just the defense.
But don't overwhelm your e-mails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be as much of a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you might as well build a statue of Putin next to the statue of Pooh Bear.
Maybe you put it in a way to touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks at artists.
As soon as you don't give a new picture every day and at least a new picture every other day, your ranges will go down to the bare minimum.
Plus, it keeps changing what function is more important, like, comment or save.
It's been pissing me off lately, so I might have to go down to the tick-tock, where a lot of artists in my line of work are successful, and they're barely allowed to do it.
In the end, I might even like to see something user-friendly come along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration by the Workers' Party on Donbase
The union – yes, the break – no, the opponents of the SSSR break express their views on the film.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the White Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violations of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that “the Union of the Union as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
With one cut of the pen, they “returned ” a huge country with nearly 300 million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnicly Russian citizens have found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia’s population has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the past seventy years in one sitting in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, braked agriculture, and tore away from the world's greatest power 14 republics, which had previously been economically linked into one mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see population poverty, economic disintegration, science, armies, crime growth, interethnic conflicts, war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, war in Syria – all resulting from geopolitical surrender, surrender to the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There's a term in political science like "vakuum of power."
Everything that was betrayed and abandoned in haste quickly filled and conquered the countries of NATO that adopted our geopolitical surrender.
And to this day, the whole world is shaken mainly because of events from the late 1980’s and early 1990’s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover may not correspond directly with its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it, and I'll put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will be left to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a liability for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I'll wait till Thursday and the meat will be reduced to CZK 69 / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would make this meat different from what I bought on Monday by CZK 120 and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer my own questions - nothing.
All this crap about something being cheap, it has to be definitely bad, bad or bad, and it's so retarded, to tell you the truth;-)
Now, I went to Hlavs in Brno recently, and there was a brochure in the underpass of the ladies, and I always take stuff like that to help the temps, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of the functioning of the world, but nowhere did anything about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some sort of an agitation.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and then Scientology came out.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless instruction, like I'm supposed to wash myself and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to please this person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
For a year, it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by, and then she started going crazy on her head.
Then I ended the relationship with the one that I told her that I was breaking up and lied to her, but that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and not get any more amok.
Such a person will suck your feelings, emotions, and joy out of you.
You'd better keep your distance.
When insurance companies are ripping off here furiously by buying a cloud of tests and hurrying for positives who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it wasn't for a test.
All we're achieving is a complication for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been grounded for five days.
In the west, they've stopped the clown show and admitted there's no point in dealing with a disease that's weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new, and he has to steal something else and drive his ego by making up a poof.
I see we've got a good old bastard coming back.
After a few years of attenuating and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is once again returning to the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), initial promises about training products and business skills quickly shifted to "not your concern, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more of a way to scare and talk people into it.
When the first money was made, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to fish for a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so it made one feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
What can I say, though, was a valuable experience, one has learned not to jump to every level and thoroughly examine the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put them all in the same bag.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen many of these things in the corporation where I work.
HR's cool, managers mind their own management, and they're not really sticking their noses in anything.
Regular evaluation is going on somehow, in the form it is going on in our country (set some targets for the next year, see what came out and what didn't) - it's more self-evaluation than someone judging you by some numbers, etc.
Corporate events also optional.
But even within our company, we're a little unique - they're a department that's more corporate.
Sometimes you feel like we're almost-starting, squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works that way, they don't bother us much as long as the results are there.
A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched for the missing 32-year-old Czech, who was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in his resignation Jakub Kulhánek on social networks that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that they found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose more information about the case.
I'm so sorry for your loss, he put on Twitter Kulhanek.
A young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28th on her way home from work, and she was supposed to pick up cash from an ATM before she got on board.
She was reported missing five days later by her colleagues at work.
Then the London police started looking for her, Interpol listed her as missing people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case, and what he suspected, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, new councils were assigned in four municipalities
On Saturday 11 December a new council was elected in the villages Komňa na Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mostecka, Nová Ves na Libereck and Přidá na Pelhřimovsko.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected council has fallen apart.
There were 99 valid candidates in the new elections for 28 mandates.
The vote was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rádná, where 93.62% of the eligible voters voted.
The mandate was given to 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men applying for 28 representative posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections for us symbolically concludes a rather demanding but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, the first Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12, at 3:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to cope with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went well without any major hiccups.
Coping with how idiotic a large proportion of the population is on all its layers, I have a problem with that so far.
I look forward to getting inoculated (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He would be deprived of his post as president and of his ability to retake it.
The chances of this happening really are, but how others here mention it very small.
Besides, I'm not sure a shredded file could be considered treason.
Velezrad is an act that threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: The number of people under the age of 35 who have been without sex all year long grows
More and more young adults in the US live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who renounced sexual life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who have reported that they have not had sexual intercourse in the last year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic effects of the coronavir pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks, or video games that make sex less and less a priority for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has been growing rapidly, stating that they had not had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among married people, and only 5% of them have reported that they have been without sex in the past year.
Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious foundation also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although the spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and under 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided by premarital sex, about 30% thinks it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group there are minors, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone says about these 30%s.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital relations, religious foundation is the reason.
Since 2008, the ratio of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60% for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less believers", the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking of alcohol during pandemic times, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that sex is less likely for people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seem to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replaceing” this need.
This trend took place mainly behind the lockdown at the time of the coronavir pandemic.
The whole vaccination policy against covid is about whether society should force some of the population to behave that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
I.e., the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get inoculated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we're responsible for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who's screaming something at the side of the SPD and the PCS about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will really have themselves to blame.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up for a dry fight?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, weather complicates the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about a religious man.
One day in high school, the teacher led us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we walked down one quite wide street, and who do we not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but I had a conversation with a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We're so spoiled.
There's not much going on, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honours.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is worth addressing using diplomatic negotiations, even within the “Normand Group”, bringing France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine together.
Morawiecki said that he informed the Chancellor of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and used people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to cross the border (illegal).
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but another nun tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving priority to driving and driving from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, said TVN24.
She admitted another nun hit the vehicle asking for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestina.
She was subjected to a breathing test, and immediately after they found out that she had over two miles in her blood, they took her driver’s license.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess her actions in court.
Dog Hugo is doing the best he can.
But Juraj Shaimovich did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen in American stories about dogs.
In doing so, however, they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After a cheesy film by F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, the audience's emotions in the cinemas are now being watched by us.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Shajmovich Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some famous characters around him are returning to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is dying, so they start to call him a doggie, Julie's father and her partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
Director with partner Beatriz Shajmovicová (who is also a film producer) dealt with the storytelling procedures already in the previous dog picture, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that evokes a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's get this straight.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to darker delusions in her desire for a child and, if the right "constellation" comes, is copulating with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are, on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired Colonel Mojmir, despite years of training, will shoot his own daughter in the forest (Julia), who will fall into a coma, after which the family is taken away from the hospital so that a miraculous process of dog recovery can take place in the heart of Šumava's solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pet animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer wonders, though, what a content pelmel full of incredulous situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a competition of doggies, a Šumava charlatan, cops arriving to report looking for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilized power of bone meal – and which a baked family in the guest house will of course get drunk.
When a heroine wakes up after a difficult coma and then sits in a tumult and makes out with a cigarette at the family table and demands his father's whiskey and slacks as a cured vegetarian, you can't laugh.
On top of that, the viewer will explain that “it sometimes happens after a coma.”
Sajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of the work with the text, the ability to build weighty situations, the feeling for characters as well as the point and overhead guidance.
Actors' performances are unbalanced, the cut is baffled and the overall impression is wronged.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand up to their party, they have little to play.
The only set of the film remains poetic footage of the Šumava nature cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions by which the characters commit themselves.
The argument is not even an old membership of the Dachshund Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
Good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a man with a dog must include knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
This did not work out in this case.
For a good family picture there is a little too much erotic and minimal feeling for the genre.
Even as a canisterapia ad, this amateur piece wouldn't have gone through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how you understand shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to these kids all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case it's a part-time job.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry moons.
Winter is the only time in a year when it rains.
"The total absence of rainfall during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Weather Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long - term collision average for November.
The two-day rainfall of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas set, rejoiced the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasím Ashkar.
The rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are shock and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
This is not only about forests, but also about the supply of drinking water and the irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring due to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the levels have been dropping.
Water managers warned about the drought a long time ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a reduction of rainfall here," the spokesperson for the Uri Schor Water Management Office of Israel predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or recycling of waste water.
Economicly weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are increasing tankers.
Water ducts and private wells are drying out.
"This year my orders increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," said Imad Sulejman, a tanker driver in September.
The clashes between farmers and security forces erupted in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed was completely waterless.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Action Against Iran
Israel’s Minister of Defense declared that the negotiations in Vienna had not made “any progress” and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz stated on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida Gantz, he said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “any progress” and the world’s powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I've been prying the lady a little bit and grilling her conversation to see what she wants me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I've had a little bit more doubts and questions, and I finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I'm a punk, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
The mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first more tension of those interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the week there is no need for snow and some ski resorts started operation.
She did not dissuade the skier or the obligation to prove herself with a covid certificate for lifts.
While the ski lifters do not complain about their lack of interest to customers, some ski rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to the ski trails and ski slopes during the weekend.
The skiers enjoyed the weather, which today offered excellent snow conditions as well.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from Friday night skiing, when we had our first skier on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sport complex Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the centre in Branná in Šumpersk was opened.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today there were an estimated 400 people.
The terms are great.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not save praise from the representative ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after losing the disease covid-19.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and prove the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the ski centre Špindlerův Mlýn.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski rentals and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, the interest in renting skis is.
It's not like in the past years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava Skiopava shop.
He expects more tension during the ski course period.
The director of Snowbear, David Shinták, of the King’s Garden Society, also feels that covid is not as interested in renting ski equipment as it used to be.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowing.
Compared to the period before the pandemic we are at about 50 percent, told ČTK Shintak.
According to him, people got lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, there is a large demand for a rental in Novako on Boží Dar.
Ski rental started there a week ago and interested parties must order them in advance.
"We start lending runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a great deal of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also a ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There are clever and clever people who have no property going abroad.
The owner of the company doesn't just go abroad.
But he's completely in agreement with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one beautiful day, reigning for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election.
If things get bad around here, some traditional V4 freak can win here, too.
Young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic was in full swing autumn, in Thailand the crew of the film Ostrov led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of the face on social media.
Is this a real injury, or is this a make-up for filming?
London police are still looking for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are beginning to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor, of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, at around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
Last reportedly, she was seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her coworkers on December 3rd.
According to British media, she was an assistant nurse at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St. Thomas Hospital.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," said a group of medical establishments in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help find her to contact the police," the communication continued.
The public also calls for cooperation from Harriet Harman, who pointed out the Srnc case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are of course worried to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a special responsibility to try and find her, because she was out of her native country, away from her family and worked here for our health care," said Harman.
Police have previously detained a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news site, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
It's not "big quantities", it's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the invasion and are beginning to get sick of our entry.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what made you think Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is off on so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that with the first pun war and the "anexie" of sicilia :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia has annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would match.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they will touch mainly suburban connections
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, which relate mainly to suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
The integrated system is newly engaged in Mladoboleslavsko.
In the capital from Sunday stop express trains from České Budějovice in the Garden City station.
In suburban train transport, trains S7, which pass through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to České Brod.
In the recently operational station Prague-Garden City, the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will be newly stopped.
The PID will be newly extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go all the way to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Old Splavů and Turnov.
Buses will be included in the Mladoboleslav region, including lines with a cross-section to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Region.
With integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced, and 12 operating lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will come out of Zličín in Prague, which will go to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague – Kralovice and Rakovník was also created, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and during the weekend links from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line number 404 will start new.
The new PID system includes lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec Region.
They leave from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
Backline 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonný in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of local lines in Central Bohemia, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín.
All trains with departure from Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and near Kolín.
The changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
The route of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk has changed and some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Horovicka in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/ lunch at the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-min break, and my only option is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidlo.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what I'm gonna buy and buy pizza buns and yogurt and apple for lunch.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you, that's how it is.
And it's not the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason they forbid us to ride off ski slopes, but it's one of them.
Confession of the Gift of a Relationship with the Bear: I was not looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has lived nothing but a revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been pulling together since summer, and the famous football player even got a divorce for the singer.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to the fans explaining why she had been hiding love from them for a long six months.
"I dare to say that there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěd," Dara Rolins joked, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She said he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and even though they are accustomed to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it's coming out of the can, or us, whose lives are being dissected in detail.
It's like one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough for each other, or you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your former partners and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's cool, that's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
The bear has long served as Vice President of Juventus Football Club.
They didn't come out with the truth until now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to end.
He and his wife, Ivana, had been separated for three years; they were not married on paper, but only for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We're just people too, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband, and just as he is with me, I stand by him. For better or worse, she shut down Rolins.
Hey, the other commentators probably already said everything, just confirming that colleges are great to start, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two, and then they found subleases together, which seems like the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments aren't usually advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but looking at the offer won't hurt.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejla, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, French etc., that is a bad address), even some parts of the Jews are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is a lot of student, the King's field and that way it's fine, except it's close to most of the BUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native of the Gate, so I can maybe advise Brno as such if you lack any more information :)
What an example of "normal" thinking.
In fact, because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is quite all right that the state does not finance some schools sufficiently.
Either they learn what they want and they pay for it on their own or they go by state and they pay for it.
We can't let a private actor take over a piece of education just because he's going to raise a few crowns to a full state contribution, and that's how he's going to be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement is somewhat lost in weight when written by a person who, two days earlier, expressed himself in this way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a voice against someone having an abortion is the same to you as a voice against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise I have already experienced during cataloging/digitalization that (even long-time professionals) it either somehow throws it from the eye, or write something on the way xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and in the note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I don't think I'd recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note based on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and keen student, you can look into some sign databases and look for the nearest one.
But since you seem to be drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't that more of a Oder Empire than a OderN?
PSS: Someone's already cracked your story.
Check out that comment with
Politicians have no idea what will be the 'them' of our Presidency.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, but some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is a matter of lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, it is quite interesting with English, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't get the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I get home from work at 10:00 p.m. and never have a problem?
The fact that he's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's barely been there in his life.
Yeah, probably most of the Romani population of Brno live there, but all they do is get in the way of the sidewalk and the parking lot where they don't have :D it's not like I'm afraid to climb the street there tonight.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap apartment with good access to the center, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without Dada and Gelem's mistress as a stake in a fence!
Who's he gonna spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most of the people on the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slovacek didn't.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen the wreaths, and I'm sure Lucie has some, said to Lightning saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras' words that he often visits her.
She visits, but she doesn't live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after he left.
Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We met recently with Annie, Felix, and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelemová: SUPPOSE!
Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelem:
But we talked all the time, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts on a continuous basis, and I'm sure I'll buy both Dáda and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the baptism of a music video at the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slovacek, who was happy to meet Ludek Saturday's wife Adriana or the singer Kamila Nyvlta.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know any other file that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops aren't enough, and they can't afford it, so the firemen themselves, and nowhere else is that high a percentage of medically trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend just Ostrava goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, they've been begging for new toys for long enough.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic has been going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, the waters have decreased in mountain and sub-mountain areas, with fewer rainfalls being recorded in places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
Climate change is the cause of drought in much of Central Europe.
But the impact also enhances the way we manage the soil.
What is there to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what playing hockey and that tactic (what I tried at Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total bummer.
And whether you're the "bear Russia" or "lama China" hockey team, you lose by two goals, even if you don't have to win at all costs, it's different than when it's tied.
But either way, what I listen to Czech commentators who poke, what judges notice, whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "the smell of the lost" vs. "We won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 1967 for 100,000, 871 for 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain faces an "inevitable" large wave of contagion caused by Omicron, said on Sunday on television, Dr. Susan Hopkins, the chief medical advisor for the British Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Persons infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
So far, no one has died of omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after the disease and deaths about three weeks after the disease.
The head of British Labour Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government advocated that the quiz took place "virtually" through the computer.
Of course, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is increasing to remove Johnson from prime ministership.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won by a vast majority in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that can end Viktor Orbán's 12-year government.
It will be elections of pan-European importance.
How much do you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz side controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and makes more or less tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesza to drag voters from determined districts into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
It used to be, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he has the constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
That's a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér escaped into independent media, where he tells secret service chiefs that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
Everything starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a little girl, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and was all blue, and they took me under the shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes I got slapped in education, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I certainly have a tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a kid, I've been fighting a lot, now I'm going to hit something and as a younger parent, I've been slapping my hand like that (so I don't get too much in the face), so there's never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my temper, but I'm sure the education has a stake in it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my patience with my kids, too, and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks up something, it's probably not possible not to screw up their kids, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws are to be clear and unambiguous.
I'd call cunts the ones who make the law in that quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're afraid of a blackout?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying a product and you'll have something to pay the mortgage on?

Where will Slovakia move the process with the killers of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial begins in Slovakia with the four defendants for the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connection to the top Slovak politics and justice.
What will the process mean for Slovakia?
It's the press's fault.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention than the anti-petition of deans of all medical faculties that came out a day or two later?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíèek's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is at an end and there is still no law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of the deep storage of high radioactive waste.
The Legislative Council of the Government cut off the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after the years of the past.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against a deep repository, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-administration expects a greater strengthening of its options when deciding on the repository, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to redo the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, who has the Platform at his disposal, is criticised by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the choice of the site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the initiation of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a substantive intention almost completely ignores public involvement and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statists in the authorisation procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire search and selection of the repository site, its authorisation and operation.
According to today’s legal standards, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the Office or the Minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation shall decide.
Any action shall not have suspensive effect on the performance of research or construction work.
The codecision of self-government that the Platform is asking for is a principle commonly applied in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced in storage authorisation, such as Sweden or Finland.
Moreover, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by SÚRAO and following contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
According to the contract register, the total amount for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, the deputy mayor of Cejle from Hrádek and spokesperson of the Platform against the deep storage site said: After the industrial ministers, who settled the position of self-government against the state authorities in search of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste just pushed on their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which sees the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building similarly, as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The deep-sea storage platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep-sea storage.
The Platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage should be conditional on the prior agreement of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced the weight loss fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He bragged about his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the Roseanne sitcom is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body caused the crackling of furniture.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in an interview for AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, practice.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit in a place anymore, he said to ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some kind of text on a platform that's expecting a reader from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and a college text, I would probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
There's more than one kind of boss.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so is "boss" something like master/master of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who are not at all needed to beat the game or level has been completed, but often are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't play with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
Well, then they're the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one way or another. Czech or other languages do not solve it in any way (it is interesting, for example, only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game of general importance, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for missing Petra from London.
Czech police also joined in.
The missing Petra Srence has been wanted by the British police since December 3rd.
Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been looking since December 7th.
He's also helping the British police through Interpol.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow memo for her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," said Kateřina Rendlová, police spokesperson.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The BOLO on Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It's supposed to come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Mrs Harriet Harman was involved in the search for Petra.
She's involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, the British police have already apprehended one suspect.
However, it is unclear who he is and what he had to do with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October indicated a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month, with the approaching end of the year, the attacks increased significantly.
We've seen a big campaign with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail should attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name had the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the correction receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eseta.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year the activity of the attackers is growing again.
The spyware Formbook remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists captured campaigns with global reach in November.
Compared to October's Formbook data, it weakened slightly in November, but still stands behind almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook contained most often an annex to the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The annex in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
Significant decline and dampening of activity are recorded by security analysts in the programme Fareit, which was worth 1.6 percent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic has had no major offensive campaign for the past few months.
That smart-ass demo today that doesn't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade of Prague was bigger than the media said.
Based on the footage of the waterfront parade and in my experience, the protestor, I'm not afraid of an estimate of about 10,000 people.
People in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and opposite waterfront communication.
That means a lot of people.
About 4,000 protestors are spontaneously added to the parade by an unprecedented number of passersby.
I'm saying something new is being born here, writes Radek Wet.
That the constant dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led them to find common ground.
Only the antivaxers themselves, the anti-vaxers and the associates would not be able to fill or pay for such a large parade.
The action of the "Dead Dog" has an upward popularity, reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they're renting the same stage and technology.
It's hard to say what kind of movement this dissatisfaction would make, not only depends on the supply of money, but also whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will become a square or more batch.
It's definitely not the leftist movement or the center movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become multidose because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
Genius actions by scientists that humanity is rightly proud of.
The end of the heel, Bulgaria has a new prime minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned Kiril Petkov's new government from the anti-corruption movement.We are continuing the change that won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition that should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, winning parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so there were still two early elections.

"Secret" footage is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, there were growing concerns about the fate of 32-year-old Czechs, which the London police have been searching for for for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the former employer or Member representing the part of London where she lived calls for information about a child hospital worker.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are beginning to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor, of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, at around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
Last reportedly, she was seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her coworkers on December 3rd.
According to British media, she was an assistant nurse at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St. Thomas Hospital.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," said a group of medical establishments in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help find her to contact the police," the communication continued.
Šumper's amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeněk Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor) reported anonymously that he was violating copyright with his paintings.
The court, however, acknowledged that Krteček's paintings in the Shuspers' rooms did not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, the green moon hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was a death.
The Magistrate referred complaints about the HSD, which road belongs to, and because it said it did not respond, the hole went on.
Finally, the authorities cleared up their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, HSD began to “situation intensively”.
