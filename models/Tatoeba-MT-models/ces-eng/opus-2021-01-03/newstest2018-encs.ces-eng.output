The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advantage of Color People (NAACP) published a warning for color people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
"The NAACP travel recommendation for Missouri, effective from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when travelling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the country," the Association declared.
The NAACP stated that this action was taken on the basis of the current laws of the state of Missouri, which make it difficult to defend racistally motivated acts in court, as well as the conduct of law enforcement authorities which disproportionately target minorities.
‘There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police only because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," the President of the NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
"We still have the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the US state.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated abuses directed against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dispute at the beginning of this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and was thrown into custody by the police without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights the recent declaration by the Supreme Prosecutor of the State of Missouri, which states that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should carry money to pay for bail or alert their relatives that they are about to travel by the state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI program, there were hundreds of hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, which places the state 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also the answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of violations of this law, which according to ACLU is to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family is not at peace after 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman's model is murdered.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie at the restaurant she worked in, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a careful crime scene investigation work.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to imprisonment in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a teenager in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl lying dead on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing on fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he falsely claimed.
The girl, according to his testimony, should have fought back, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After confessing to Dixie, he talked about his hornyness and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol, and taking cocaine, that's what Dexie himself said to the police.
He said he smelled adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces more vandal attacks destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people at large who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror mother of the late girl Linda revealed information about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda was waiting for her attackers, but they had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither violent nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who operates Prague's Intimacy boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started off inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bike but also a box full of extraordinary looking vibrators.
"Miscellaneous moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with a German manufacturer of designer erotic aids Fun Factory, which attracted Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he operates the Intimity boutique in Prague's Benedict street, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't I?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you talk about at lunch, you say?
Oh, come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No hidden windows, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how to hold Prague's shop, where it should be and what it should be called.
Intimacy's name appealed to both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it is also, you might say, gentle," he says.
Followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for suitable space, which went in parallel with the various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant, which spread the shop into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, dominated by the bed, prevailed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem ideal because he wasn't on the main street, but because of it, he was sitting in the name of Intimacy.
She's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one can see the customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with brand-new nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And don't let them be ashamed that they've ever entered such a store.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to the sex store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from fashion boutiques.
Even though there's only female service in the store, it doesn't mean women don't hesitate to ask for help, it doesn't mean a man's foot doesn't come here.
Most gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Man can't usually guess the right size and chooses bigger," Martin smiles over a frequent mistake.
It's the prejudices, the clichés, that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith might choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black underwear, whereas women tend to tend to tend to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
The expression on my face must make it clear that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's like a non-contact clitoris stimulator.
There is an adolescent need to laugh in me with admiration for the serious tone of interpretation.
It's like he's not laughing.
And it doesn't actually suck.
It's at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's kind of the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator shaped like a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe pairs.
He completely demolished taboos that may persist in some men, and he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Different variations are being made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with a remote control.
That's a popular category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the contrary, the category of attachment vibrators is a certain failure.
At least it's with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they use them only externally.
In Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it'd have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most sale is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience during use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were a big fan of erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," he explains.
The ordinary one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboos for women."For the sake of interest, what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not insolent.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and has "a certain experience with both sexual life and with some aids.
Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka care so much that they convince each product that it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to get into bondage and latex specials, because we don't have room for that either, and it's not really appropriate here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are people who've always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid something like this would come up.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really appealing.
It is also due to the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some of them even won design prizes, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever award-winning was the mentioned sea horse 'and this triggered a change in the entire industry.
It began to be abandoned from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with the health-free, to produce different designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that the design of some is the Czech Republic, namely popular designer Anna Marešová.
I must say, I was quite surprised at how many people in our country buy the design stuff Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mareš, although they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who come straight for Venus's Anna Mareš balls.
She did a really huge job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started out as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because this is not a large production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may go a little upstream, but it seems important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," Anna later describes to me the situation, which agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or negative attitude.
They say people are embarrassed at the most.
Anna Marešová currently has a vibrator on offer, for which you can have a personal message made, and this year she also plans her own lubricant.
In the next year, there should be more vibrating eggs and more news.
Boundaries of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell already?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we are rather defining ourselves as a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them go into extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one final question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail came in asking a lady for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural 20 cm long.
Well, we had to tell her we didn't have anything like that.
The question is whether anyone was making fun of us," Martin takes a suspicious look at me.
Even that happens from time to time...
A shot for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend fights a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately it is true," confirmed the sad information of Lightning himself singer.
I know about my illness, and I'm handling it pretty well, given the circumstances.
"I take medicines that have associated symptoms of disease to slow down," he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family has come together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife tries to stay home as much as she can, her father's house in Bílá Hora arrives with daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Tereza, the son Karel said Karlas takes care.
Generous fought cancer twice and passed his experience on to Slavík to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's had 60 chemo.
After them he managed to return to work and to the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I have been told by the astrologer that I will be here by 90," said Karel Lightning.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of songs so that I don't forget them," said Karel.
Actress Květa Purple is now fighting the same disease in the institution.
Do you have a Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, and the law will assess the U.S.
In Chile, an absolute ban on abortion is still in force, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing in Parliament for more than two years," lamented Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and by the end of August, it should be given a new chairman, who, according to AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current president Michelle Bacheloret, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because, according to her, it violates the right of an unborn child to live.
Members of the vote on the bill postponed last month until it was analyzed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, Members approved the proposal and did so again after them.
According to the new legislative regulation, abortion should cease in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is resulting from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, in Chile since 1931, even before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Other are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years of prison time for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion that the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
The critique of statues is a sign of the regime’s change.
Americans could tell about this as well as everyone else - see carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, surely knew what it was coming to, when in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the President's proposals to drastically limit legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It's fair to say Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and impersonators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with a famous poem by Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reprimanded Acosta by saying: “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal, which you refer to, is not part of it."
Miller's really right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
These are, above all, the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - they are invited not only by immigrants, but by the poorest of the poorest: "Let there come to me, who goes down, who goes poor, who can barely breathe, who can barely breathe, who with a miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these "poor worms" on our screens.
Miller wasn't trying to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who, after her death, sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew very well that they were embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the connection between the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
He also has a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The merger of a poem with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan Baptizer in Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not actually invite anyone into the country, but represented early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He brings out a torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States."
Oddly enough, Limbaugh is referring to something important.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of a exhausted and damned passenger who often comes to a new country after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean with hope in his heart.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championship 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom's Neil Black athletic federation said that a strong team of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be a "a huge asset to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the World Championships in London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that something strange is happening in Scotland, and British athletics could learn anything from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand it and adapt - we will work on it," said Black.
“I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
That's what people on the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," said Black.
“A few athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The passion and unhidden feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist of Commonwealth, who will compete in the run over obstacles to 400 m at her fifth World Cup, said that it was "unbelievable" that 16 Scottish athletes were on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Muirová has set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
On the MS will participate in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500 m track. This season he won the British team races and annual games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
Team captain led her to be “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got on the team, but in many cases they will also attack participation in the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary position of team captain is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by team members it was a pleasure," she added.
“I am clearly very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves where we've moved to.
They're athletes who will think of the front seats on stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it's a good one.
I just pointed out that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office unless you can stand the criticism of voters
Our father knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take long to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he wasn't trying to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Free speech can be taken away from us - and stupid and dumb will be led like sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties for these crimes.
The governor's staff dismissed the suit as unfounded, and many "who cares" opinions appeared in comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He can boast of the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not irritating.
As you can see, he runs his own state with certainty and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turns out that he is also skillful in using Facebook as the main means of communication with his constituents - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a bare head after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked official and managed by his employees paid out of taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by blocking the comments from the position of moderating the posts.
But using the image of Internet trolls, spammers, or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had their donations deleted.
That is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As they all said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current reports," she wrote in the Washington Post commentary section.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same subject, some people are called promoting so-called collective efforts instead of being recognised as a larger group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest" would probably be called "defence".
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage the posts by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing an action by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born in Virginia last week.
According to District Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, where it prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the low shipping price had practically the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and many anonymous writers questioned his position as leader.
And even in those times, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by people in the framework of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were gathering in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And the true leader must accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, they use more data abroad than at home.
Abroad Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they are in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is what the typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This results from the recent statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the flat rate than at home.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum of our citizens go through the winter, data consumption even increased fifty times this summer.
Italy took second place in the ranking of the data consumed.
Most minutes the Czechs will call from Germany, where many of them go during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agents, Croatia visits 800 000 Czechs annually, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged the book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
The record was July 7th this year.
"Tens of millions of photographs could fit into the data transferred," the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová specified.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is located in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is only fourth and Italy is sixth.
We are going to Austria for hiking and an active holiday, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"Moreover Austria, the Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growth in data following the release of roaming charges, the growth in telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes called in roaming increased to double last year.
With a huge head start over other countries, Germany dominates.
"Roaming calls are more used by business customers on business travel," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former top golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administration area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, succumbed to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of ambassador of the tournament on behalf of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a keen advocate of this game and he's proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I have a good feeling about this," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have a chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament was cancelled a year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and I were really into winning.
It was a beautiful time I'll never forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns on domestic soil after celebrating 50 years from the region this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said about Helensburgh.
“You want to be successful and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really liked to play again, and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far."
The three players will also be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup competition Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free of charge. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be paid to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the land of gold in Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, it rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the province of Papua Indonesia, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the speech of the local "nota" - right into the fire.
After half an hour he removes the potato and enjoys it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room with no roof is cleaning the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock, no one dares wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of public upheaval before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Yakart government, which controlled the entire region except foreign journalists or civil rights overseers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and ravaged city, where you can reach after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach gripping on the ride.
Mass transportation doesn't work in this place.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners, have looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy are one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is the land of gold in Indonesia.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to some 153 000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 did Freeport mine gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army to the Papuans.
An investigation conducted in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The Papuans calling for self - control threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in the Papua tribal area during the 1970 ’ s were equivalent to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission stated.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a report by the British Archdiocese of 2016, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, especially popular electrocution and execution - and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The fact that Papuan resources attract colonists to Indonesia made the situation worse.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% claim Christianity, but demography changes with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Locals are struggling to survive.
"Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura Province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua Mama-mama have lost their jobs."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, known as Jokowi, promised in his presidential campaign in 2014 to address inequality and violations of rights.
Former carpenter secured and his journey to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he would answer our call for justice," said You.
The fact is that only two months after the inauguration of Jakowi in October, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the dark of the night.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was this reproach and tone, which she was touched by and later returned with four other soldiers, said the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the drunk soldiers pursued a group of children and beat them with their weapons’ butts, presenting victims and witnesses of events.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned down the electoral commission building nearby, and the following day, things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field outside the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came up with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - where they run in circles and imitate the singing of birds - the Mee Pago tribe of Papua.
Several Protestants began to throw stones at the buildings.
With increasing tension, troops were given an order via radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot," according to the weekly TIME, in an official document whose content was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the imminent danger and invited residents to break up in their homes.
But no one had heeded his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said TIME weekly on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people everywhere and a lot of shooting was done," he added.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, one of the local residents, Alfie Youw, was hit three times.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," said the weekly TIME with the gloomy voice of Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told journalists that his officers had only "secured" the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said Pudjo Sulistiya, Spokesman of the Papua Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injuries.
The murder report went through the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his sympathy for the victims’ families and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be heard.
“Most violent crimes have been committed a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
In an interview of June 5 for the weekly TIME, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be brought before the court".
Wiranto, accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the shooting victims in Paniai welcomed his claim with mistrust.
"In the last three years, I have been interviewed four times, but I have not seen anything so far," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many inhabitants of Paniai who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten up by members of the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army began to look for me," he said.
And the shooting isn't stopping.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The struggle, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at them, and the answers were warning shots fired.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitarist police) began shooting into the crowd and killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retribution," said 29-year-old Domingga Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured arrive.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal, who live in central highlands.
Many of them joined the Movement for Liberation of Papua (OPM) - an army of rebels that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. They are among the not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people of Paniai in recent years, all under the pretext of “ensuring national sovereignty.”
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papua as “a tragic and forgotten place.”
The oil pours poverty into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is still unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are intended for the needs of the family, they sell the rest on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire opened more routes and new immigrants have started to flow into the country, economic inequality has increased between native Papuas and immigrants.
So few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to get into business.
"Young people move out of villages due to lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to its isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from Papua, because of a “lack of cooperation with the authorities,” despite the fact that they were given such a rare permission to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and to achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the most rebellious eastern areas of Papua and Western Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia on Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - ran the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanath Nasir, dropped the charges when he told journalists in Jakarta that: “The democratic system is still in force in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals are calling for foreign governments to participate.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, the local people cried out according to the source, who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto “We want freedom.”
There are more elections scheduled in Indonesia for 2019, but the Papuans say they won't vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of a robbery army - are lying in poverty, poor education, and a health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, regard their voice as a “debt” that Jokowi must repay.
"They do not want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of paniaic shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of resistance: burying the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least they won't let responsible people forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus, with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy picked up a huge shipment of cocaine in Australia.
The French Navy intercepted a $1.46 million worth of cocaine in a Pacific yacht.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
During the intervention, a four-man crew of a ship was arrested, probably made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, known as Afalina, sailed from South America and was dragged to a port in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian intelligence agency said that, in cooperation with its international partners, it would seek to pinpoint exactly where and where the drugs were headed and to reveal the 'Lithuania Syndicate'.
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that stopped large quantities of drugs going to Australia," said its CEO, Col Blanche.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first one in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
This could be a problem in the elderly's homes, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová could be an infusion of saline, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
They're only applied in medical facilities so far.
The older you get, the more water in your body drops.
"In addition, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally receive less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," said Mádlová.
They should drink two grand for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into an old man is a big problem," she added.
In elderly homes, she often says that no doctor watches over it.
In hospitals, they usually treat dehydration with infusions.
"I think that there should be a gradual introduction in order to allow them to receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, she says that up to two bottles of saline can be delivered to old people.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she said.
In case of malpractice, it may result in a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, and there's also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, maximum cotton sheets.
Disposable diapers may also be a problem.
"It's more nursingly demanding, but it would be ideal to expose the patient at times and let the skin air out," the doctor said.
The Torch skyscraper burned for the second time in Dubai
One of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was on fire in Dubai on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents 337 meters high and 79 storey buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries, the cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were sleeping and the alarm woke us up. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the skyscraper.
The Dubai Civil Defense reported that the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 a.m. (0:00 GMT), then continued cooling the building.
Government officials have added that they provide substitute accommodations for disabled people.
The incident could once again trigger a discussion on the safety of materials used to cover high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation which initiated the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 revealed that the most damaged linings and external panels used for decoration or insulation were the most damaged.
The British police said that the isolation and lining system of the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in the June fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. carry prohibited objects on board aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unconsciously passed prohibited objects through the checkpoints of the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least 6 percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim that they were delayed finding out that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of the survey carried out by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - to which more than 1000 respondents responded - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to deliberately travel with an object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand flying hours were compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
Food and alcohol are among the most common items that have escaped TSA attention.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly delivered a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men questioned also admitted that they deliberately put illicit drugs on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it was doing research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried out unauthorized items through airport control and how many did so on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who have transferred unauthorized objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel very often by plane.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids they can carry on the plane and in what amount.
So it is no surprise that the TSA seized the banned liquid in the largest amount.
For a time, people thought that TSA would deal with books the same way as smuggled goods.
Liquid transport is permitted within domestic flights, not international flights.
Head of the EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of the plans for the Obama administration’s emission reduction directives
After fifteen states were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, her boss Scott Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes in his plan, reacting more quickly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal appeal against his previous position with the Federal Appeals Court.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October, when States should start to comply with the 2015 Regulation for the reduction of ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as State Attorney General Oklahoma before joining the role of Head of the EPA by President Donald Trump, served for a long time as a reliable opposer of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
A sudden Wednesday's turnover is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA executor exceeded his authority to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration’s plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane spills.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with states through complex processes and compliance with new standards within a given time frame.
"During the reign of the previous EPA administration, she often did not meet the deadlines and waited for her to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing with the settlement and further setting of plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen actions at the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and authority that comes out of it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” at a certain point to ensure that regulations are “based on sound policy and the most accessible information”.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcript of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still did not pass the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that were suing the EPA this week, said that the group was not going to allow legal pressure.
"The turnaround in the views of the EPA - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," added Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-floor ozone occurs when normal harmful substances discharged by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in an atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is worrying what kind of pressure it takes to change the minds of responsible people and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological campaign of Trump's administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests."
He spilled acid on a man, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what could happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you laugh, the next, your whole life changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was flattened with acid by an unknown attacker, who was finally acquitted.
The website Reuters reported the information.
In December 2014, someone knocked on Christopheros' door.
Andreas picked up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents to the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man he'd never seen before, he poured acid on him without warning, saying, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and all I felt was an incredible pain in my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned the terrible news - according to the doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was affected, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication has become a loss of eyelids for Christopheros.
It's probably the most tortured thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described.
Today Christopheros has completed 12 operations that are far from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have scar tissue scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformity and deformity throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused his close person.
The police investigated the case properly and then tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the amazement of Christopheros’ family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be lifted, because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the last few years, the numbers of corrosives have increased considerably.
The Home Office expressed its views on the issue by planning to lay down new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But victims of similar attacks will not give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in various stores, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai was burned at night by the famous The Torch skyscraper, one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to Dubai’s civil defense, the inhabitants of the 80-story building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai police, there was a fire on the ninth floor and it was spreading up.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were asleep.
We were woken up by the alarm, people were screaming.
"We went down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another of CNN’s witnesses estimated that about 40 apartments had taken over the flames.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to a civilian defense report, the fire was managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
A large fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over 100 flats.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was harmed, as the residents were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became the world’s largest residential building with its 352 metres.
Another Dubai skyscraper cost him his record the next year.
Bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substance in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a variety of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease or anorexia - was found in a sample of 23 - year - old Ippolita.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him with the title, he ended up fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian Rugbista David Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which until then was a record number for caught athletes.
According to his words, a third-league player began to take steroids the year before when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucky Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged passionately with an ex-lover!
Just as Lucka Vondráčková has entered the Czech Republic, she is busy.
And it also attracts attention wherever it goes.
Her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years, last fell into her arms.
The actor was 12 years older then and longed for family.
Lucia was only 19 years old then, and she certainly did not want to hang up her career.
So they were separated, but they remained friends to this day.
This was also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both blended in blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they became close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's pranks, and she fell on her stomach.
After that, they hugged and willingly posed for the photographers.
But their meeting was not an accident, because they will be playing a couple in the new Prima series Captain Exner.
The Islamists in Great Britain were sentenced to life for preparing an assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four Islamist cell members to prison, who called themselves the Three Musketeers, and according to the prosecutor's office, she was planning a terrorist attack against the police and the military.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities at the time thought he was about to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbelieving", and a gun make-up.
It happened the moment an MI5 secret service agent placed a listening device in the vehicle.
"The recent assassinations showed the horror the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped," said Prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25, and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years in prison.
During the London trial, the men claimed that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also questioned him, but then rejected the defendants' claim.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
At Hodonínsk they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With a 38.3 degree Celsius recorded in Strážnice in Hodonínsk, it was surpassed by Thursday, which has thus far become the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, many temperature records did not fall on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records for 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years were broken or evened.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednice in Břeclavsko on Thursday 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of degrees and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice it was the biggest heat in Dyyákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where mercury reached 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, according to the ČHMÚ website, for example in western and northwest Bohemia, the highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
"The temperatures only started to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
Current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually wear off according to ČHMÚ and on Sunday there could be even more significant rains.
In most places, however, temperatures will remain high on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia as well as on Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions to visa policy.
For decades, China has sought to exert its influence without the use of force means.
Every year, they spend $10 billion to support language schools and build universities abroad, push their entertainment industry into foreign markets, and try to attract Western tourists.
That's not a good thing for Beijing.
The state media there are talking about a plan to turn tourism into a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists came to China from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, evaluating the situation in the most populous country in the world, Professor of Economics from Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
China’s visa policy is an example that speaks for itself.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contact with China, and the citizens of the others have to take care of their visas in advance.
At Chinese offices in the US, therefore, crowds are comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in line for it, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build up significant economic obstacles.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that visa requirements reduce the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and where less than one percent of all residents live, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself when tourism uses its political goals, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China reduced transport to South Korea in the spring as a result of a clash around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year on year, while Japan grew by 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the Fed Central Bank of America, China could have left up to $190 billion as a result of China’s foreign travels, while China, as part of its currency sales, received about $35 billion a year for incoming tourists.
According to official figures on balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China’s entire surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, strike a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously hindering capital outflows.
However, the above factors are only one sign of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
In the United States, some cities have more.
Japan, which is not exactly the intersection of immigration, is double that.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
In China, however, you will not find them.
It will be politically challenging to solve these problems, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, in particular India and Vietnam, have been making great efforts lately to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, they multiplied deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Pilsner Kingdom of poison can enjoy the young of three rare, deadly reptiles.
At the exhibition visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatoli, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"It grows by a metre", said the spokesperson for the Martin Vobruba Zoo.
The cubs of the other two species, death-boys and cobras of red, will be gaining strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian vipers came into the world, descendants of a breeding couple native to the Sydney population.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the mortals around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that wintering of 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius is necessary in human care.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a bunch of African spitting cobras red.
A total of four chicks hatched from four eggs in the Pilsen Zoo.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species sprays poison on its victims in a distance of up to four metres.
It's aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The babies of all three species feed on mouse sticks in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they expect to hatch babies from the mamba's pack of black ones, eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of a phone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a phone conversation on January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump ordered him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president blamed him for publicly condemning the building of a wall, saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
Trump, as part of his campaign, promised to build a wall along the southern borders and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
He also leaked the transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. refugee surveillance agreement going to Australia was "stupid" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - that came out under President Obama - he would look like a "drunk" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the US.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day".
Tusk testified again at the D.A.'s office for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to worry about," said the brother of the dead president, Chairman of the Government Party Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński, at Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied and read the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
On leaving the D.A.'s headquarters, according to TVN 24 TV, TVN 24 was waiting for a crowd that chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
According to his words, he blames the prosecutors nothing, but he does not doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against opponents, opposition or people they do not like, and I fear I belong to this group.
He's been in interrogation for the second time.
The exhibitor has been questioned in the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time he should have been questioned about the misconduct in the autopsy of victims of the Smolen disaster.
In addition, the body was converted into coffins.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there had to be some reason.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"The maintenance of good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU," said Kaczyński on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would frustrate Tusk's chances of obtaining the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also stated that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk had an eight-hour hearing at the D.A.'s office on April 19th.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his subpoenas for questioning considered it part of the obvious effort of the Polish Government and PiS Chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The prosecution is subordinated in Poland to the Minister of Justice, who performs the role of Prosecutor General.
The summons for questioning soon after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, to whom Kaczyński tried hard but in vain to prevent, among other things, the visit of Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, and is currently in a comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry explains.
"In some countries new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has been changed," says the material.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which is given by the representative offices to which the ballots are delivered.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the print version.
Their list is changing with the decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs could have voted at, for example, the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also abolished its representation in Bamako and Kyoto, Malaysia.
There will be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, the Senegalese capital of Dakar, and the Zambian Lusace.
Since the last parliamentary elections in Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation by the Consulate General in Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
The ballots will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to select members in the polls at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Election Commission shall determine by lot the region for which candidates are voted abroad.
It was the first time in 2002 when it was decided among South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemia’s candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is increasing steadily.
During the premiere 15 years ago, some 3800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were around 6700 people, four years later 8222.
10.571 voters came to the early parliamentary elections four years ago.
Massacre on the Moore's Ford Bridge: activists recalled racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the bystanders of Monroe, Georgia, and stuttered towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, however, a group of white men with weapons blocked the way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled long from a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want this n-and Roger!" shouted the man.
"Bring him to me!"
The silence breaks the roar of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of events that took place on July 22nd.
But when one of the men throws a noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a regular group of activists have been returning to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been tried for murder.
"It's a wonder that in all these years not one person has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the reconstruction of the event, let himself hear.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call for action. Every year the Monroe community reminds that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first," Brooks said.
"In the meantime, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
The M.E. is covering one of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files from NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were to participate in the lynching.
But no one has ever been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the citizens of the city.
In April 1946, by decision of the Supreme Court, the people of Georgia were given the right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election that, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab the owner of Barnett Hester's white land during a skirmish, allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, hester was hanging out with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and he got her pregnant.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the former prominent owner of the white-skinned property, Loy Harrison, made a $600 bail for Malcolm.
Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
On their return from prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and hid the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks was more brief on the matter.
"It was a massacre because of the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all local black people: 'this is how you will end up if you register and vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Its performance is figurative, engaging, and apt, showing deep-rooted racism that many would like to see as extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us," said Greene.
"But there cannot be a relationship between us if you do not hear what I have been through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white people, the rest of black people - poured into the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to his words the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, or Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcom is arguing with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n-e!"
Rascona can't be.
There's been a struggle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" he asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'n-r' in that tone at the time."
"Exactly," one of the black actors blurts out.
"You need to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make sure it's done after enough of the four victims of the massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct expression of the word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, gunshots... and silence.
The woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of the actors and sings the grieving song of Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, about a dozen bystanders wipe the sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience has virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
A couple traveled all the way from New York Ithaca, many bystanders from nearby.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks in the crowd leads them to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Up until now, the murders could have been watched from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words of the song, Greene will challenge the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The kids kneel down to the victims' heads, watching fake blood and motionless bodies and whispering something in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
It'll be a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
Actors clean up the rope and tear their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actors and weeps in their arms; eventually his emotions touch him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
“We know you don’t like the role.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience meets the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her feelings about tonight's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... that people do that look like you and do that because they look like you," she said.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic," she added, "just called police brawls."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in a courtroom, enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about it," he said.
“If we don’t learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything were more of a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one piece of paper that had hieroglyphics showing the connection of some parts, all of which had some secret markings.
Years later, when something went wrong inside me, I offered the deed to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a smirk, he told me what the labyrinth paper was suitable for.
Yes, it was a used tool in chronic toilet paper depletion.
Playfully, he found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl badges again.
The new times have brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where it simply stuck to the chopped grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
Especially well done was a sketch with a description of how to insert one part into the other.
The set was two-piece and the other procedure simply was not possible.
Putting it in reverse took considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic parts.
My contempt for instruction ended with my seat Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with instructions for small repairs, which included, among other things, the exchange of light bulbs.
It was easy.
Three steps in total, and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author failed to mention that while the bulb on the right went to change really only in three steps.
1. Take out the cover.
2. Unscrew the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3rd, pull the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of a battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the interior of the car I would pick up some spring, screw, by which I would easily move the cover and then I would follow the points 1-3 of the energy saving author of the service book.
Wrong footbridge.
The shelter had no place, no space for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Slesan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was heightened by my wife's entry into the garage, which was summoned by the ryk and words that she hears from my mouth quite rarely.
"What are you doing here?" she asked without a doubt.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss vulgar terms, there are only two published words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked a sentence that could be her last in a long-term union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, and I put the main emphasis on the procedure of the author's manual, where blessing with hot iron on the hand, which wrote the instructions, then by appalling it, so that it could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of manuals of Hammer on Witches, including his commissional burning at the top of Losinsky Castle.
"Why don't we remove the box?" meant the woman who removed the battery.
In pure despair it happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of a collapsing state after checking two of the State Department's drug control officers.
I know him as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field and who can tell wild stories with an unexcited voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having a handwashing manual," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I got the whole problem out of him, which was that he did not have picture instructions on how to wash his hands over the sink in the toilet of patients.
His argument by the Commissioner that adults usually wash their hands and that they do not need pictograms to cope with the usual activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that a simple washing of washed palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of the Kromanon, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
It must be said that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joy to find that one washed his hands exactly as ordered by the hosudar of SÚKL.
Finally, I have to say that I was inspired and prepared a detailed plan for toilet activity.
On the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in the case of urination, due to certain differences in both sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains the pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure means a precise drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage in the prude's toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that throughout his life he has been wiping his opening with a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson will release 3,000 more employees and reduce the dividend in an attempt to revive trade
On Friday, the British education group Pearson stated that it would release 3000 additional employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to the next restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which according to Executive Director John Fallon’s statement will take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, is followed by the company’s previous decision to release 4000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of the third cost reduction programme in order to revive declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
Last month’s company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, reported by official officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as stated in NATO's statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died during the attack in Qarabagh County.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bombing - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at the Herat mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after the patrol and members of the Afghan army were attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device".
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are at the American military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is an important source of concern for NATO Allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31st, more than 150 people have been killed by a large explosion in the city centre, the most deadly militant attack in the country since the U.S. troops overthrown the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to assist military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks to which, in recent weeks, the public’s confidence in the government, its regulations, and particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghana, have shaken the attacks.
In response to the action, the EPA reconsidered its decision to postpone smoking rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the Obama administration law, which ordered states to reduce emissions, only one day after 15 states sued the Agency.
In Wednesday night, EPA announced its decision to refer the “Ozone Standards 2015” to the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views," said the CEO of EPA Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the efforts of the EPA to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 of most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA's conduct is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to avoid the many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have launched countermeasures by democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA reports on its website that breathing with ozone content “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, ” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this quite new singer in our country in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer held a monstrous event in Czech conditions, where he hosted such prominent personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was hosted by no one other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show up to the public and to present your music music video to Sara, whose baptism was hosted by just-named personalities.
Few who already know, however, that the recording itself, which took place in Russia, did not go without a hitch and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it couldn't have been without a proper embarrassment.
Sara's song is very emotional and based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramatic scene, the singer's soc was supposed to indicate a slap in the music video.
At one point, however, he struck him so hard and straight in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I did not expect it, immediately my nose started to bleed," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on the set was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not have time to react.
Fortunately, the injury wasn't serious enough to affect the continuation of the next shooting.
We now bring you the young artist's video video, and you can also record the scene with a punch.
Not a bad version with blood, but it was preferable not to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomacechenko spoke at a meeting about the possibility of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomacenka and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, first met at a Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in the offices of ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight champion World Boxing Council - did not come down to the hall, where he welcomed Lomackenka, the champion in the springweight World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory based on a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday's showtime game, both boxers made it to the list of the top five easyweight boxers.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said: “What’s up, champ?
Good luck."
She defends her title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomačenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a “perfect test.”
"I am a former cockweight champion," Garcia adds.
“I had to gain weight because of the broner struggle (67 kg) but I’m not that big.
I'm small at my 63 kilos.
I'd like to go back to the lightweight category.
He's gonna have to put on weight again so he can get on lightly... then we can fight him.
That's what the fans want.
Why don't we do that to them."
Squirrel agrees.
"A box would be good for this game."
Klimas made a request to pay for the viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should complete his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title in the Forum arena on 23 September.
"The match should be a viewing payment, that's what fans want," said Garcia, who later said that the possibility of broadcasting the match is open through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw that kind of attention.
Let's wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as a "awesome boxer" and could participate in his Saturday game.
But he didn't let Garcia's praise lull him when he said that the Riverside three division champion looked "very slow... I'm sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt an increasing tension in front of each other's duels.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other game attracts so much attention.
And I will put a great deal of pleasure in the fire," said Garcia.
He said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
They found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians Ilya Žirnov and Kira Čerkasova have been missing since December 2005.
There's been an extensive search for them, but no success.
And the police ended the investigation in the wake of lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, there was a sad ending to the whole story.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the river Volha in Čeboksary, Čuvašsk.
Thanks to the documents that were left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The papers survived underwater for a decade, without them, it would take the police much longer to identify the victims.
A couple were last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
So far, the diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksar police, who dragged the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by an icy journey along the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its termination.
The latest results of tests to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people were surveyed as older than 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the context of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failure to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has handed over 6880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was considered to be over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the interview was “perhaps over 18 years of age”.
In the other 423 cases, it was decided that the interview was "perhaps under 18".
The tests shall be treated only if the age of the person questioned is disputed.
According to Johan GÃøransson of the Forensics Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
"Compared to the last month, the statistics stick to the track and the numbers are very similar," he said to The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the person concerned is 18 years or older".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondents said that it would be 18 years old this year.
The criticism was also given to a medical method of determining age, which includes a wisdom teeth x-ray and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is involved, among other things, in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person underwent puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue, and I do not think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine age with precision, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," Metro said.
The forensic medical agency Agency, Agency's GÃ¶ransson, defended the decision by saying: “In general, the risk of misrepresenting a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person questioned is just below the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all those questioned."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump, in a phone call in January to Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, threatened not to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would be arranged somehow, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It follows from the transcripts of the interviews published on Thursday by the American daily The Washington Post.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after joining Trump Peña Nieto, he reprimanded non-diplomaticly for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He portrayed the South Neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump repeatedly said in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to make defiant statements.
They say the funding will come up with a plan, and it'll end well.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," said the American daily Trump.
At the same time, he called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but perhaps politically the most important thing.
The executive order to build the Trump wall was issued shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a wall of 3200 kilometres, as a result of which the relations of both countries have escalated.
At the end of March Trump said that the project would still be valid for the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported Trump’s telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
He was moved to this conclusion by the exchange of views on an agreement whereby Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States’ acceptance of people from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but later he agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you have created, but you will have to stick to it," he told Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump appreciated the good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation got heated.
"I hate the reception of these people," said Trump.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for the local milkers," he said.
In an interview, he also noted that in five years' time, a fugitive could become an assassin from Boston.
Trump was conducting phone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, often several during one day.
In the end, he described the conversation with Turnbull as the least pleasant one all day long.
Before ending it, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Rana's killer was executed in front of the crowd.
Her father was watching.
The execution took place in the square in Yemenu Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari as his victim, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her father's house, raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has hit an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, together with the crowd shouted the word "let justice live".
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was taken.
Cops put him tied up on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his weapon against him and fired fire at close range.
The present crowd celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia have prevailed," he added.
I was standing on the Square of Liberation in Sana awaiting the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, grab and lynch the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the direction of the Shia Houti.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes after the arrest, but his actions were so outraged that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that ran Ran's body were terrible," he told the media.
"The morning disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a terrible act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began gathering outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held and demanding immediate punishment.
A D.O.D. rep read the present crowd a record of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not show remorse over his actions.
Just before his sentence was served, the officers read him the sentence, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but a lot of footage was posted on the Internet by the crowd.
The governor of West Virginia announced the change of political party
Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced Thursday night at President Trump's assembly that he was crossing over to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I say to you that I can no longer support you as a democratic governor."
The crowd of bystanders exploded into joy.
"Tomorrow I will join the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited large property from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: “The defection of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party that puts obstacles in our way instead of making our country rise up.”
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the last straw for an already miserable party without a leader who is in vain seeking to find a positive and unifying report," said President RNC Ronna McDaniel in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "honest" apology for the doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but again he said that it was not the right time to return Russia to the sporting world.
The head of Russian athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championship in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “to all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way. ”
Despite his comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think we have seen a very frank answer and presentation today," Sebastian Coe, President of the IAAF, told journalists.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and worked as hard as possible to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation."
Coe said that he was also “pleased” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have moved on to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendations of the crisis crew on maintaining the punishment that was imposed on Russia," Coe added.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest ones," he ended his speech.
At the World Championships in athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF.
On Monday, the head of the IAAF Rune Andersen crisis crew said that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being admitted back.
Drug testing is still unsatisfactory, and excluded coaches continue to operate, telling reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF Council.
The CzechTrade contract was awarded to Frantisek Savova, whose state pursues.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publisher Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
Officials awarded him 100 percent of the points in all quality criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecutes Savova for tax fraud and asks for its extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced in April a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract totaled CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishing house of the Young Front of Entrepreneur František Savov.
The Czech police charged him with tax evasion in 2014 and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
News server Aktuálně.cz alerted the case.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award was to be decided from 60 percent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion helped the Savova company greatly.
According to information Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
This is what moved her to the next candidate, the publisher Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with the amount of CZK 404 900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324 350.
In contrast to the Young Front, however, it received 62 points from assessors in all quality criteria.
Tendru was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which belongs to the server Aktuálně.cz under the label Economia.
VLM has raised several objections against the result of the tender, considering its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, the Authority decided to challenge competition at the Office for the Protection of Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the contractor of the contract on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, a clearly favoring participant Mladá Fronta, a.s., at the expense of the proposer and other suppliers," says the proposal to initiate proceedings at ÚOHS this week, published by server Aktuálně.
According to Michal Klíma, Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an incredible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," Klím said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not fundamentally comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in the Contractor's Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin in accordance with the law.
"After the conclusion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on its progress," Štěpán Dlouhá, media representative, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that Economia's publishing house intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in that article.
In the tender, she could be helped by the fact that she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was first challenged in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive deductions of VAT by his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO Andrej Babiš movement is behind his criminalization.
Last year, the London court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any information from the UK regarding the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to this day," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague Municipal Prosecutor, told news server.
In addition to ownership of the Young Front, Savov was represented in Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Czech Budějov brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
It should also control the failed Heavy Machinery Services company, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker drove down the walkways and the park, ended up in the gaskets.
The biker attracted attention by unscrupulous driving on the streets, walkways and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to take her in the direction of the station.
"The officers of the men followed the city with caution when he failed to drive on one of the side roads to Mariánské Lázně and drove the motorcycle into the field where it crashed," said police spokesperson Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, which transported the injured biker to the hospital in Pilsen.
After that, the police found that the biker did not own the driver's license, the registration plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number engraved and the production label itself removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The presence of alcohol in the driver was excluded by the breath test, but a positive result on the substance methamphetamine was detected by the test," the police spokesperson said.
How the Financial Rules of Football Will Affect the Transfer of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will in no way disrupt Neymar’s record transfer from Spain to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 state that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar would demand a salary of several tens of millions a year.
There are several financial conditions following Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a rich Cathar family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on buying players, but on the other hand, they must demonstrate legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of football-related business activities.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after the appointment of Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements were ultimately deceiving and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP’s rules redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spent a lot of money on players y to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
In the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may report losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cheferin, is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," he said last week for Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules.
Although the PSG has paid Neymara a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44,4 million each year for a period of five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions FFP hit in 2014 PSG together with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi Group.
PSG is fined EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is careful about teams that can attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Catharic company sponsors the PSG once the financing exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority of the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar's PSG revenue could be paid from the MS Football Commission 2022 in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the representatives of the MS 2022 in Qatar denied that Neymat should become an ambassador to the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would easily be revealed by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's informed UEFA, there was no investigation into Neymara's transfer to the PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as it was not entitled to comment on the situation with the PSG, said The Associated Press.
The latest published financial statements show that the PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The club expects an increase in turnover of up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
The Spanish League’s leaders, evidently concerned about the departure of one of the greatest stars, sought to thwart Neymar’s departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of “financial doping” the club and the state,” said the President of la Liga Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Cathar Syndicate.
Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports tycoon, shares the same position of the La League on club financing.
"It is the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once the club owner becomes owner, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state can have various interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan backup Rosický: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Thomas Rosicky's on the set.
Same scene as the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
The Spartan back-up guy started the game against Creepy Zvezda, he invented several goals, but his teammates did not go black.
The letenský team pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements thus ends after the initial two-game in the European Cups.
Was it hard to do something about the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the goal was scored, four had to be scored, which was hard for us.
We wanted to at least lose, raise our confidence, so we could get away from the next game.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get to the game for so long?
The game is so worked up.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere. We fired at halftime.
Of course, that's awfully low when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponents into those positions more often.
Is a large number of changes in the lineup a problem?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new team.
We've only played three competitions, and the lineup is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging for you that you have already played parts of two games in a row?
They're still just parts of the game.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, that's the only way.
It's the same as with an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta decided somehow, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
Once again, there was a wonderful visit, just like with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show me something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember those visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing games, so it's not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, an entrepreneur is supposed to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax cuts.
The calculated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
In his complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
The Constitutional Judges, however, ruled the complaint unfounded, found the CTK from the court database.
The ÚS is not another appeal court.
"It cannot, as the fourth instance, assess the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a breach of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision of the CFI.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage suffered.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion that had a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis between 2005 and 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was created only during the period from January to July 2008, the total leak, according to the expert, exceeded a billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Service did not include any invoice in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in mere statistics.
World Service and some companies with which the company was trading have a relationship with the businessman Radomír Vybír, who was charged 13 years in prison for VAT machinations in the fuel business.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
"Summer for Survival" and "Comrade Detective" series play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both figures from the famous 1980s; as for the dirty 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the "The State" comedy sketch on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, 2001, before the stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd broke into larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the franchising point of view, it looks like someone's out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin has told).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teen horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults do not push so much to the emotional level and satire is sporadical, including the parody of the '90s thrillers as "The Hand on the Cradle".
At one point, the character finds on a pile of Apple Powerbook junk, roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991".
Many major story lines repeat themselves.
Beneficial Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not moved over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), which George H. W. Bush (a very well-occupied Michael Ian Black) encourages.
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair, alias Matt Dillon character from Youth, whose once respected Andy character is now behind the old paprika.
Franchise could kick off moments of random madness, such as the return of the series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I assume will be a logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", when the whole group will embark on the premiere of "Summer to Survival".
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the Cold War series "Such Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regret" and even "GLOW", in which icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scene clash.
The comedy of the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak directed by Rhys Thomas is supposed to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who are fighting for truth and atheism after a way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - tough Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, which were dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (the executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as police officers watching chess on TV – parody for American football).
The series was played by many famous actors - Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But the "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a killer with Reagan's mask - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too intense, and comedy moments aren't enough.
With shorter footage, the propaganda satire in the "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, where two fat people devour hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The fictional Romanian creators were right: we do so with our own culture as well as theirs.
Russian athletes did not see the IAAF launch ban lifted.
The International Athletic Federation of IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on starting Russian competitors due to the state-supported doping program.
The vote in the event of the World Championship, which will begin on Friday, was very clear as expected.
166 delegates voted in favour of extending the ban, against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the rejection is mainly the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before Congress by the head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban should continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been interviewed and there are still trainers working in the country with a damaged reputation.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already perform testing under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming World Cup, who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
However, they will not be able to start in national colors at the championship and will not play the Russian anthem if they win.
England Bank will hold the interest rate at 0.25 %
The Bank of England should announce, as expected, that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by a lack of economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has stifled speculation about sharp growth.
England's bank warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in connection with maintaining the interest rate - despite wringing family budgets.
The policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) The Bank of England voted six-to-two to maintain an interest rate of 0.25%.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue.
At the same time, the bank indicated that growth should occur over the next few years as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit, and also indicated that the rent on the financial markets should increase more than expected.
The members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was intended to support the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the future financing plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start to apply as of next February, although the Bank of England has stated that it will now offer £15 billion less than planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household income and consumption burdens.”
On the subject of rates, the bank said that it would be necessary to “tear the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “to a greater extent” than markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be “slight” and “limited”.
The bank reduced the growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The projected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
After publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euro.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after the disappointing increase buried the hope of further growth - GDP stood at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a slight comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases. The bank said that the situation would get even worse before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy 'cannot prevent' cuts in revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise 'significantly' towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also increase thanks to the great interest in British goods thanks to a weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after last August rates were reduced to 0.025% in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will last at least four years.
Prior to the Bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with increasing inflation, which exerted increasing pressure on households, and three political officials demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said that it expected such a change and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess relative to the 2 % target was ‘totally’ due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montiske, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Because of the recent fall in swap rates, competition on the mortgage market seems to only rise as soon as creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and re mortgages - there are no fees available in the offer, as well as low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS prescribes a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 patients
From September onwards, patients will gain access to “transformative” treatment to prevent HIV based on the Supreme Court’s decision to fund NHS.
The National Health Service of England (NSH) reported that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period through medical services.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court ruling of last year, stating that NHS had funds to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England by Director General Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention’, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a ‘decisive moment’.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 will be fully implemented across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV between patients at risk.
Pre-sex administration of PrEP means that there are enough specific medicines in the patient’ s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who will sign approval to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program comes to taxpayers at £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to distribute drugs this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and fully exploit the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, Managing Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: ‘We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH has been offering patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to coax a partner, leading to improvements in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, Managing Director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; we must ensure that every patient is kept available.
We now have a PrEP trial drug at our disposal, and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Secretary of Health Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will lead us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those who are exposed to HIV and together end the spread of HIV in society.'
High-Length Life: Mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment into Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate banker, traded a big house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace, it is an illustrative example of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something for a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment at Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away and said yes to him the same day."
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone complete renovation.
A one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add the storage space and the mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used the almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps would fit above each other - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full rooms on top of himself - and at the same time add to the dramatics.
In the mezzanine looking down on the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
But what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical aspect," Erfan says about reinforced veneer doors.
"The doors are equipped with counterweights so that they can move away very easily."
Thanks to smart use of space and storage space, Joanne received another 16 square meters, second room and better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a residential area - or an appraisal of your property," Erfan said.
"The real estate broker essentially calculates the price on entering the apartment on the basis of the living space."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space while maintaining quality materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
“You don’t love the power lines in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't win."
As it turned out, quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is disjoining.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and declared a retaliatory ban on traveling its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, but US citizens can travel freely throughout all 50 countries.
This is about California banning the spending of state money on the trips of its citizens to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT, and any act of disapproval of LGBT's lifestyle is a discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has adopted a law of conscience that states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with LGBT patient therapy is not obliged to provide it, but is obliged to provide such patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
In turn, Texas and other states have passed laws according to which religious charities, which have been given children from mothers to adoption after birth, are not obliged to give these children to adoptions to the same sex couples.
Because of these laws on the reservation of conscience, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travels to eight states of the Union from its means.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have trips to scientific symposiums in Texas, for example, paid off from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must obtain either federal grants on their journeys, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the trips of citizens from State A to State B or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and his parliament has passed a law with a resolution that he also dislikes California's high-tax policy, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but he does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's putting them up as a rematch for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as decide what their money is going to do and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what is wrong with the reservation of conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why do you punish him for selling pork, when butchers offering pork are enough?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or alcohol-containing cakes.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes with hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all Federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policies in powers that are not federal, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California could be California and Texas could be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and allow all reasonable people to live by, but some activists seek not tolerance for themselves and others, but extreme intolerance for others.
According to them, no one can ever demonstrate moral, religious, or philosophical disapproval of LGBT's lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in American history where states have done this on purpose because of political issues, except for one case.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of black people, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery, and the war of the North against the South was about to take place.
Of course, there will be no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the states of the blue democratic and the states of the red republican is deepening, and the US is mentally intertwined.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic got a grease fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalnyi was fined 300,000 rubles for violating the rules of the campaign before the presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court fined him for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to apply for head of state in March next year.
President Vladimir Putin has not announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He fined him for calling people to demonstrations through videos placed on the YouTube Internet portal.
The fine is $300,000.
"Later we take them off the judge's salary," the critique of the Kremlin joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the judgment politically motivated.
The fines of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, were imposed on the court on Thursday by two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyi joined Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Naval in every way possible.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing from the Kirovles Forestry Company.
In May, the verdict was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so final, which, according to Russian law, prevents Naval from running.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the empire was established by their Italian family, are overrunning one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides at Toorak estate, only three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who drove the dispute over common assets and commercial assets to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly being disputed before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, her brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, the first store bought by a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
This is where the Westco Jeans family founded the company, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
With money they bought more properties and the portfolio of the De Lutis family now includes offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul, is “a significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
The court files state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate while Paul manages real estate for $167 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and funds has become a problem.
"Colin's proposal came out in my eyes to his advantage," Paul wrote in an affidavit in a court of law in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, cut off Colin.
Colin contradicts the fact that it is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that my family is the most important thing," he wrote.
The costs of the court stand are rising. Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defense attorneys of both parties.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in his senior year of college, Paul was still a young, perhaps ten - year - old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of assets to the sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of a group of De Lutis family companies. Colin stated that Mark was compensated for $10 million on his departure and Luke was compensated for $26 million.
As Paul said, both Luke and Mark were “not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite being a former member of the board of the AFL club, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin, stated in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied through a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to settle the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of Colin’s statements in court, he stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation," he said, adding, "he still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hopes were out of sight.
"Our disputes will soon be resolved by court hearings," Colin wrote.
Hot in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers also get water and summer clothes.
At Na Chodovec kindergarten in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a big shadow.
There's no pool, but teachers shower in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children stay in the classrooms where the blinds and curtains are closed.
They're trying to cool the air with an air cleaner because they don't have air conditioning.
It's hard for teachers and cooks, too.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation at this time," said the kindergarten director Miloslava Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in kindergarten, where she thinks the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We air out the morning after 6:00, the windows close, and we have blinds on the south side to protect ourselves.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrazi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nut, there's a table underneath it, and we do all kinds of things there," said Barbora Kompanová, head of kindergarten.
The teacher tries to walk with the children into the forest, where it is cooler.
Children wet hats and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a manual pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," said Kompanová.
Also, the head of kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prague's Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers try to keep their children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a relatively large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a low - sugared tea or dilute juice, and they have a water drinker in the garden.
Each day, they also eat vegetable salad and always have fresh fruit and vegetables, which parents sometimes bring to them.
"Maybe today one mother brought about a ten-pound melon for the children," she added.
Drivers get water or a summer uniform.
The Prague DPP transport company provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, according to DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabs, some trams are air conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks haven't seriously damaged anything yet.
Minor damage occurred in a loop at the Hostivař.
At present high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have sufficient drinks at their disposal.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, alternate points and roads," said Řehková.
In the roads and in some alternate places, employees have so-called so-called so-called so-called soda producers.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," said the spokesperson.
Hot and dry weather in recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic destroyed 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic were rising over 35 degrees Celsius, he employed firemen mainly to fight fire.
"Fires in the natural environment prevail, as well as those associated with harvest work," said spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová.
Even evening weather changes, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and rainfalls, did not bring relief to the firefighters.
In connection with the storms, the firemen were going for 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"The most intervened in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoral continues.
The help of firefighters was also in Stvolínky in Českolipsko, where 60 people from the children's camp were evacuated to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesdays and at night on Wednesdays, ambulances went out to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from karm.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warn the paramedics.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless odourless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Signs of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and fainting sensations.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media diet.
Before him, many tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico said that the new Chief of Staff in the White House is planning to reduce the flow of information from President Trump - including news reports on TV news - in hopes of keeping Trump on the surface.
Here's part of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day in his new position with the staff, he outlined the key problem of Trump’s White House, which intends to correct: incorrect information that comes into the hands of the President.
Kelly announced to the staff that he must personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a word of speech - because the president can make a better decision on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth on Trump's check and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was disturbed by honest reports, it was fitting to show him that many other media were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince," said former campaign advisor Politico Sam Nunberg in February.
Tara Palmeri, from the Politico portal, wrote that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets at bay - at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that praises him.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something other people don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if someone hadn't checked them.
We'll probably never know about the tweets Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times in check, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But no one has been able to stop Trump regularly from encouraging controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by subsisting materials - which can but may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico Portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of this information from reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“Current and former Trump officials claim that the President often responds very angryly to negative news from the media, especially information leaks, and seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the 'source of many leaks of information' from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever banned from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not support his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “tryed to implement the system to manage and document the information that President Trump will receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to put forward the same strategy.
Maybe he turns out to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just disappear, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These constant factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionary Quarter'
Once again, several of the most mobile homeowners in the English county of West Midland are fighting with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities about the right to regain the field for their settlements.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a thriving street in Solihull, known as the “millionaire quarter. ”
Bringing horses, children, and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May, not afraid of a ditch that was dug up on site on the basis of the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
The tact group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected gap, which served for the journey.
The angry residents of the district attacked the Solihull City Council, saying that ‘it is not able to solve the problem’.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said: ‘ They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Governing Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to a different place and now they're back.
More arrived last night and probably more will arrive today.'
She added: ‘Birmingham’s Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I don't intend to pay any more taxes until the board deals with tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous. Just recently we watched the last tourists leaving and now they’re back.
And this time there's more, and this time they brought horses.'
Solihull City Council’s press secretary said: ‘We are aware of the unauthorized residence on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any non-social or illegal behaviour to the police at 101.
This will give us the overall picture that we will present in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
It was brought by a government special.
The government special delivered the injured Robert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and on board the plane was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský, according to information, had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious shape ever since.
After transport to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of Bratislava hospitals.
Economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská by NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.

The Italians are adhering to the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships coming to the coast of Italy with Mediterranean immigrants unless NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization refused to comment on the matter on the grounds of the accusations brought by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"For us, and always will be the number one priority in saving human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at present," the organization said in the statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all current charges after gathering all information and evaluating the situation."
The Italian authorities have been tracking the Jugend Rettet ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, which were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
According to the prosecutor's file, at least one meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation stated on Thursday that new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not represent any ‘substantial change or obstacle’ as regards rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct was also rejected by the Organization of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has been heard that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks landing in Italy in rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
"We are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel in the last few days," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations this month with the mayors of Libya on the subject of economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of achieving Europe.
Shameless Mesarosh: She had both silicone and cellulite coming out of the frontal!
Hot summer days are quite tempting to wear only the necessary parts to cover up the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and all that have to do with TV Prima, it was swarming, she wrapped her body in a mini-overal.
And all it took was a few normal moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
It's because it's been cut between her cheeks many times, and it's gotten so high, she's had to adjust it all the time.
She certainly did not need the attention of the masters and photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages encouraging Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her friend to commit suicide by text messages and phone calls.
20-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of two-year imprisonment and then spend five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father testified in court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood at the scene of her judgment with tears in her eyes, her tight hands and her eyes pointed to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the judge.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
However, Carter’s attorney said that these were “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on its actions. ”
The prosecutor read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “There will be no day for me to mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will bear the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," he said.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, has testified that she's being "followed" by the knowledge that she'll never attend her brother's wedding and never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of a person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I'm going to carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would penalise a person who helps to kill another person, thus establishing a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published that fueled suicide.
"I don't care if you hang yourself, jump out of a building or stab yourself," Carter said in a text message just two weeks before he died while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to get the generator back on and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from commenting in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who took Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison. ”
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just the day before the Audi notification, the BMW car manufacturer stated that it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
President BMW said that the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of BMW - which consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide released by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the costs of car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines are increasing, making it difficult for cars to compete.
While German car manufacturers face careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which, in order to meet the emission limits, installed software in their vehicles, which reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, a former head of thermodynamics would have been arrested by the engine development department in the Audi.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he can face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by the German police in the case of Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to bypass the European emission limits - and thus extended the accusations that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of an Audi car manufacturer in the investigation may have an unfortunate impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer makes an disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane crash landed on the beach.
A man and a girl have perished.
An accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the Witnesses told SIC Noticias that the plane flew just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people reportedly fled from the beach from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
According to local media, a 50 - year - old man and an 8 - year - old girl died on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both escaped from the accident alive, and the police took them in for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are motorways in the Czech Republic even final?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even when it started to be built in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 Wall Highway.
For at least a few months, the Earth Children movement has stopped the construction of another section.
We East Bohemians get freeways by bits, like slicing salami.
They cut the wheel, and then we'll see when and if we ever get another.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or Poland from villages and cities.
The endless currents of the trucks go straight through the cities of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a reasonable way around.
But so far the last section of our dream highway was launched in 2008, i.e. an incredible nine years ago.
Not a thing since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradec Králové recently began to be built and on other sections to Jaroměř began with an archeological survey that started at the end of this year, you could hear a loud banging of the corks in eastern Bohemia.
I mean, no one believed it anymore.
Last week, it turns out we're not building this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Klub movement for sustainable transport from Brno gave decay.
Earth children repeat their tactics from D1.
They attacked the building permit decision in its entirety.
In decomposition, they request a review of all the already issued binding opinions of all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Wall City Hall, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, from D11 we ride near the village with the eloquent name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we prefer to go into the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do Earth Children want?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of roads in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually incomplete in the existing system?

Lavender from Provence is a threat to climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the South East of France, but they are now at risk of climate change.
Lavender is dwindling as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, causing alarm on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The footing of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
The cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which thrive in a dry climate, are also to blame."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and oil made from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped, and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
More efficient water distribution and water evaporation slowdown can be a possible solution, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
Riodoc weekly staff meet regularly on Wednesdays to discuss news about the riots in the Sinaloa area involving organized criminals, corrupt officials and the ongoing drug wars.
But today, under the strain of recent events, it meets mainly for its own safety.
They learn it's important that they change their habits.
Two worthy journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked by a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to name names for every word - there is no need for any evidence, just use imagination and hunch.
Selecting them from what - drug traffickers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job is to cover up crime.
Violence continues, and the bodies are piling up across the country; journalists are constantly growing among them: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pen Niet’s rise to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven were killed in all seven countries this year.
Among them also co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence connected with the drug trade.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the sign "Justice" on it shows the middle finger, hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - aged over 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists, two suspects have still been sued, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, so journalists' killers get to court very rarely.
Journalists from Riodoc insist that they inform about the violence that is happening in Sinaloa; even though they are destroyed by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about murderers and without a vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoc headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 missiles, apparently because of the name of the article - which can be translated as the 12th River.
The shooters then boarded his vehicle and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumours seem to spread rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as the rival faction tries to fill the void.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of embellished two - story mausoleums for drug kings, many of whom are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "peace" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoc, still accuses himself of not protecting his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
The peace could upset the sons; suspected gang members bought up all the copies of the newspaper at the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the fight against journalists by Mexican criminals.
He was able to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
He was practically a veteran in Noroeste periodical when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and set up together with five colleagues of Riodoc.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without mentioning the drug trade," Bodorquez said.
In time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to embark on a search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when he received the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "life-style", said Valdez last October in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
“You must take on the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?'."
The employees of Riodoc miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their job best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you get involved with their women, their children, clean stores, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bodorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The problem is that the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that “the smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then it happened with Javier.”
The old rules according to him, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc’s employees meet; spyware was discovered a few days ago, bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen find relief before the 40 degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect Riodoce offices, located in a four-story building in the town district of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been a few months since the journalists last set out in mountainous areas, which are basically controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also have the lights on for suspicious government spending that took place in the home town of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several abductions at one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the State's Attorney's Office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were on guard when they were about to write about what everyone in the city knew: that the restaurant was a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist reads from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-ranking corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's sons, "El Chapo" Guzmán, escaped the military task force.
A month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez’s section, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would definitely crack the case," said Villarreal (46), who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists. The staff certainly did not expect to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out the next morning to demonstrate to the state's attorney's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacan.
Only a charred body was discovered, and the authorities say it's Adam based on DNA analysis.
Journalists’ activity is escalating across the country, many of which organize protests and scribble on sidewalks and "SOS Press" buildings.
The director of Bodorquez is visiting Washington today, where he is trying to get international support and get justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa, which took place the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murders for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she requested a transfer to another department for fear that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "beset" by organized crime, corrupt officials, and the indifferent public.
In his last book “Narco-journalism” he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the order of politicians and security forces who work with organized crime.
The Media Supervisory Group Articulo 19 has accused police officers and public officials of more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my messages. ”
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to cease their activities, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern borders of Chihuahua State, in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breachová.
The others are still going on, just like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a tough decision.
Finding a job in exile is as difficult as getting rid of the feeling of being haunted all the time.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day presents a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer, when suddenly the phone starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
Not one day goes by and the opening headline changes again.
The sound of the police sirens points to another shooting.
Bodorquez is throwing a fleeting look at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloa - all Riodoc employees follow his steps.
"How could we possibly think of leaving," Bodorquez said, "when one intern asked me to send her to the streets on the same day Javier was killed?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first finds of a wonderful rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called 'Mona Lisa dinosaurs' - have found a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to identify the reddish - brown color of his scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
The article in Current Biology reported that it was “the most preserved yet found armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world. ”
The fossil is a new species of Nodosauridae family. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described him as “remarkable indeed. ”
According to National Geographic, the armored white-eater is still the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is done, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
'You just need to turn a blind eye and believe that he's asleep,' said the director of the work of Caleb Brown and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
'It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
By studying his skin researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank - most likely faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system that uses many of today’s animals.
Experts claim that this enabled him to blend in better and avoid enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspapers in May. Currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours carefully exposing fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved fossil condition, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a masking method commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part.
Although this cloaking effect is common in nature, researchers’ findings are surprising because Borealopelta’s size far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation to survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebra or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to fight for its surviving literally.
'Prevention of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the chalk age,' said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely red-brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for further knowledge of its life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
At that time, the climate of Alberta was the same as in Florida today, and rivers and oceans were much further inland than they are today.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin, while it is preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,' said Brown.
‘For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as in the chalk age.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just need to squint your eyes a little bit and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the Cretaceous period, giant terrapods, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaur, a 11.5-meter-long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt’s body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the nose to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
There were two 50 cm of thorns sticking out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of Canada today until he ended up in a river that washed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote wrote for National Geographic, ‘the finding of such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking the discovery seems to me.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing up.
I can easily count scales on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York City, a native from St. Louis sat down on a bed in an Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah kept retweeting her wall posts.
Rapper of St. Louis posted his posts on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying in a rut on the street, where no one took him out after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone away to get back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held in his hand a sign saying "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son"!
She was watching live news - one of the cops was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and his other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she said, held in his hand a gun aimed at the crowd and shouted, "I will kill all of you... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
“This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to, and we can call it normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the next three years describes the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which will be released to the cinemas on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, the power and indomitability told from the perspective of people living in a community who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell conducted a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower jersey and the same flower headband - on a subject that they had discussed many times before - "experience with black people".
“Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?” he recalls the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old, and that's not right."
"It was out of the question that I would not take her with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the culmination... that has occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but also to recognize the difference between the different layers of experience with black people and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is no different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only harm her."
Upon arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on South Florissant Road was opposite the police department, which became the base of activists who expected the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing for the rest of the meal.
Together, they prepared food in bags and helped distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9," Ferrell said, adding that in her studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell became acquainted with the later documentary director, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell, however, wondered: “Do you work on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used? ”
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to earn money from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unquenchable conversation: “We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that. ”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
Ferrell, along with six other local residents who were watching the "Whose Streets" team in the years following Brown's murder, also integrated his participation in the project.
"In this document nobody speaks for us, but it is our testimony," Davis said.
"This was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the savior leader, but about the community's rapprochement," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most open-minded of film participation.
The documentary “Whose Streets?” describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, smiling at the thought of the first moment when she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and to humanize the blacks, I had to open up."
In addition, Ferrell’s story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the murder of youngster Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leading positions are ultimately behind the preservation of the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the move is actually supported by black women and a lot of eccentric black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not a mere acquittal" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the documentary because of her opinions.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
“that she was the one who found herself in the front lines is no accident, because life on these intersections in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the surge of energy in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, TV station cameras have cleared out their positions, but severe racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year probation for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the social political atmosphere in the area she calls home as a "disorder."
Still, she hasn't stopped trying, which she's committed to since she hit the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
All we have to lose are our chains."
There was a field fire in Cologne.
There were dozens of firemen on the scene, a helicopter helped.
Near České Brod in Kolínsko, between Bylany and Liblice, there was a fire from 14:00 in a field of approximately 15 hectares.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, fire department's declared a third-degree fire alarm out of four possibles.
According to fire spokesperson Ladislav Holomčík, the helicopter helped to extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00, the firemen managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for CZK 70,000.
There were dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fighting the flames on the spot.
The fire was created due to a technical defect in the engine compartment of the harvester.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed it over to the owner, until 8:00 tomorrow he will be guarded by a volunteer fire department," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms in the New York Fridman Gallery there are several faces of different skin shades - white, black and brown - hanging from the ceiling on the wires. Each one of them seemed to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cable on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines her experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence reduced Obama three days before leaving the post of President of the United States.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a razor-sharp, if not intellectual comment about DNA yield, as well as many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, spoke from her youth of being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 charges, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were held by prison employees, and only one black and white photograph of a lower quality, which Manning, visibly concerned, was leaked to the public, sitting in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, positive responses to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions were still coming out.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were preparing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visitors and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Supressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the comic book was released, President Obama applied for the release of Manning, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is interesting, indeed, that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people who seek to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to incite hatred in areas that he should support with his tweets.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything is happening for a reason.”
Under the statement of the artist on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in surname is printed with a heart) after the end of "self-involved factionism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centipede letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope that people will get away with it, that our genome doesn't care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg. Her 2007 work on video is also available.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
He's showing Manning how he's coming up on King Kong's way out of United States Disiplinary Baracks with a megaphone in his hand.
"Once you are prevented from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Never be silenced."
"It is a direct transcript from one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not visited the exhibition in person - as predicted in the comic book - but when she does, she will be welcomed in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic forms, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maningo, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like crowds," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor of Northwest University and employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
These days, there is a nationwide search for a professor at the University of Northwest and employees at Oxford University who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man found stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment, said the police.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for first-degree murder against a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County court file.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago P.D. said the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
Cops were notified of this by phone. Upon arrival in Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene, and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide while police are looking for both suspects, reports the authorities.
Lathem worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of the Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now under investigation by the competent authorities and the University of the Northwest is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A university spokesman and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: “The British police have contacted us and we are prepared to assist the American police as well. ”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked at the whole truth and wish he'd applied to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down suspects are increasing," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional, and national authorities assist in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his sacrifice," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management has issued a statement to all residents: “The police are now working on building up the victim’s timeline and profile and investigating various motives, including domestic violence. ”
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitala Mutko said that it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
‘Part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for renewing RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing that should concern Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren about the alleged government's doping sponsoring of Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutek's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: “On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of performing doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
Nevertheless, the organisation allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping agency (UKAD) this June.
After visiting the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, the CEO of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was “on the right track” to renew its validity.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with the founding of Wednesday's fire of a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místek.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are Czech national.
They're facing up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general threat.
Today, Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told journalists.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the matter," said Kužel.
He said the police would discuss the possibility of taking the defendants into custody.
Further information according to the Director cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say much more yet, because the criminal police and investigation staff and the prosecutor who oversees the matter are really working on the matter," said Kužel.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Material damage is estimated to go to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church was being restored.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, additional costs are prepared to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution from the owner of the monument, i.e. local parishes, is being made.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by an electrical failure at the time.
Then an exact copy was made in his place.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for associations that can be used to defend the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is envisaged.
The Ministry of Defence, which received its task from the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the defence.
According to its authors, the basic aim of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech population to defend the state, outside the performance of a defence obligation and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would support associations of amateurs, shooters, or cynologists financially or material and would enable them to increase their members’ capabilities.
In return, he would have obtained data on people who are willing to come to the aid of the country if needed in times of crisis and their abilities or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors who would help associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It is also expected to organize discussions with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be established which would be in charge of administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would use their abilities only after the state of the threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wipe-off of previously obvious borders between different types of threats," the intention is to refer to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministries have noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just those of the military.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very broad base that allows every citizen to respond to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult to perform the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," he says.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million a year.
More money would go to pay or build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to expand the scope of regional military headquarters, which would together employ 42 other soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministry have already stated that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of a European Union directive on arms possession.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups to help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she didn't find an adequate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And even though she promised the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the hair care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New startups from the human resources sector are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the particular intention of measuring employees' duties, startups allow companies to vote quickly, target specific teams and demographic groups, also offers complete anonymity of employees and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to circumvent superiors and contact the director directly.
“There are instruments like Strava and Fitbit on the market that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the startup of Glint based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that Glint made her more aware of what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and the voting of specific teams, Glint offers a thermal map of the company and a brief overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low evaluation managers - which allows the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is wracked in scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak freely.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global sector of control, regulation and compliance by 2020 can exceed $18.8 billion.
The startup convergence from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 Convercent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, he also accepted Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable flash surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Board of Directors.
"The court of public opinion has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the startup Convergence.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior - and if regulators do not intervene - it can face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, employee exhaustion or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
Ruby Tuesday’s restaurant network employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations has been using Convergence for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace the phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
Often it was a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no reliable way to track complaints from employees.
Now that the company is using Convertent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been reached by managers, sitting in offices, miles away from the real solution to complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment - is ensured.
"This is approaching a holistic, overall view of employees' experience," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We also protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
The companies stopped taking the ethics, values and participation of employees lightly in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed after Enron’s fall in terms of abuse of employees’ ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it was only when “social media was shining on the whole thing,” that companies began to realize that they could not simply hide their skeletons in a closet in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by courageous capital investors, which supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent raised $10 million in total from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and finally took away $47 million in capital.
Glint won $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of researches clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits of LinkedIn, who uses both Convergence and Glint.
Investors earn if companies thrive and companies prosper if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employees' commitment and commitment to the company, it is no wonder that there are a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to experts on working culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is, once the company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that relied too much on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you don’t finish things, the employees start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'""
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts surveys among employees each month, is able to solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, said Errett.
After gathering feedback from employees frustrated by slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to resolve the problem successfully.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term in the field known for frequent redundancies.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing your employees, you lose your customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday has become the hottest day ever.
Thursday with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice, Hodonínsk, is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
He thus surpassed the Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about this.
Compared to Tuesday Thursday, but not many temperature records have been set.
Vedra hit Moravia mainly, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records of 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years have been broken or evened.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
Perhaps in Strážnice today's temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednice, today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of degrees and in Pohořelice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice it was the biggest heat in Dyyákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where mercury reached 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, according to the ČHMÚ website, for example in western and north-western Bohemia, today's highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures only started to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
Current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually wear off according to ČHMÚ and on Sunday there could be even more significant rains.
In most places, however, temperatures will remain high on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia as well as on Saturday.
We've had such a bad time here.
Billionaires are not satisfied with the same vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as rude as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues in the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejškovy Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in real estate Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Private Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project Andrej Babiš accidentally named Kroměříž Mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for himself.
The mayors have also recently captured their billionaire.
It is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the company for the Jablotron security equipment.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The Entrée in the mayor's jersey didn't do well for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win 20 percent in the election.
Some of them smiled.
Grandpa's slip is more typical, though.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinion.
Although he intends to apply for the votes of the voters in the mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The grandfather supported Babiš in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule by the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
He certainly does not go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
Babiš will remain a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his control world and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the mayors to learn how to work with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stands up for himself no matter what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending his B to the Mayors to build someone this clumsy.
Others may wonder if Jablotron’s boss may have broken up with Agrofert’s boss in a bad way and sought no other way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Grandpa's first public appearance wasn't just about Babiš.
Grandpa promised to send 10 million crowns to the mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to stop saying that.
After all, the court-recognized thug Zdeněk Bakala spent millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the citizens' democrats have come together for nearly 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving a political party more than three million.
If Grandpa's going into politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he wouldn't have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
Dědek crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with a university education will spend about 50 grand a month in our country.
The ones with the basics at less than 20.
A man with 50 grand is rich in his circumstances.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather’s vision, the poor pay their taxes honestly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of a social state that they do not take much part in.
Rich people simply need to be helped not to work hard with poverty.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš has to hold hands.
Thanks to Grandpa, the rest of us can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have the members and members of their party or the citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just for some.
No one wanted Trump's Paradise.
The villa complex must have reduced by 234 million.
Sale of real estate isn't easy sometimes.
And sometimes not even 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible £8 million.
He informed Mirror.co.uk about it.
The brochure says, "Greetfully, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the connection between the real estate company and the US president did not defend an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the sale, the villa complex is worth about 76 average flats in the center of Prague.
And no wonder.
The magnificent 5 acres mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the property.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed that the connection with the president was not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the common prices of the property on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with a new price, they rank second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to quit two practice sessions a day.
The 11th in the morning is coming, and UCLA football players are squirming at the sideline of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal sweaty backs, the unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members these few minutes of doing nothing takes a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place at 6:30 a.m. on the upcoming morning.
"These boys will be working hard for the next three days," said coach Bruins Jim Mora just before Monday moved over on Tuesday.
By taking out two workouts on one day, the NCAA wants to lighten the gamers - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least by Friday, when the final exams end.
This is why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - to fit into already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week before last year and the trainings are limited during the summer semester.
Eighteen training sessions are scheduled until August 20th, after which formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which will take place in September, begin.
Mora let himself be heard to support the NCAA’s decision, even though it added another item to an already charged player’s diary.
“For three or four days, players are under a lot of stress and it is very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
“But no one gave up, everyone tries. They’re great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the training camp, which will not be easy to look at the clear lines of surrounding plots from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal pole.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there might be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by security services," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not impossible that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
That kind of stuff is good for business.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot 8.
We'll use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be all right.
It's all planned."
Facebook is planning a more thorough check of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat the so-called "fake news", said the largest social network on Thursday.
The company writes in a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will be sent to third parties to verify and potentially display survey results under original contributions.
Facebook was described as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports affected the election of the President of the United States last year.
Political debates are being debated in Europe on the whole issue. French voters are flooded with an avalanche of false reports about the May presidential elections, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
On Thursday, in his next statement in Germany, Facebook stated that it was planning to launch testing of a new fake news control function in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people ask for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision about what they can share," said Sara Su, Product News Manager of Facebook.
She added that Facebook continued to test the "related articles" function and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of false messages.
Create a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeeze group, and Margaret Thatcher found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotland, however, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy place on the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, which inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County - a famous hobby in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"Look at the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the castle of Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
“This is his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying in the castle almost as a dream. ("To tell you the truth, I extended my stay a little.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that have been dumped in the ditch for centuries.
He walked around the property and examined the ruins of the old castle, talked to gamekeepers, gardeners and sometimes also artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he was "drinking whiskey and writing."
Scotney's confidential history is relatively unknown, since the National Trust organization gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of Elizabeth Hussey's last heir.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as when “the aristocracy of many centuries throw their hands at the words, ‘Take it to the attic’.
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of property: "You may think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and sink deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of a riot in the castle from 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually began in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected in the end."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, who tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a smuggler from the 18th century named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male generation — men of that time were always in debt and were spending money on things they could not afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying rich or old wives - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to shake the heads of their heirs."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is searching for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week gig in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a strange place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now get the hell back in real life'."
Washington changes the terms of the green card award
The media has published President Donald Trump's words on the new US immigration plan, which will also change when granting the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 year on year as a result of stricter rules on granting temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
New rules are being proposed by Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will do so by changing the rules of issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process favours English-speaking applicants, who abound in funds and demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," said Trump, quoted the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to the words of former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose eye color, nipple shape and the appearance of robot nails.
"People make fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more," Sharkey said on the occasion of publishing the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - artificial intelligence is of course, which mimics human behavior.
The user can edit the robot in his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
What is very disturbing is that many robots have their own "personality" that would embarrass even Stepford's missus.
Modern inflatable virgins evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character features for his replacement wife, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold of True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with an "adventure" nature.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, talkative, or "in the mood."
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - among which is not confusion for real interpersonal relationships. The disturbing are the inferior female characteristics and violent innuendos - e.g. frigid (read resisting) Farrah.
True Companion simplifies Roxxy to a male vibrator on its website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxx?" says the page.
But sex robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - moving away from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for captivating sex with an optional premium.
Of course, most men do not buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots remain on the edge of the general public's interest.
But this marginal interest can become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are earning their rights, and there is a president sitting in the White House who is often very defamatory about women.
The most horrifying aspect of the series The story of the handmaiden is not what we see - the hung bodies and the hollowed-out eyes, rather than the reality of these visions.
The book The Story of the Handmaid represents a step in the right direction, but it now seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should be as close as possible to real women (although with porn actresses).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to the touch and to act at first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality, ” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work, no history, nothing to encourage their independence or undermine their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The talk of the 21st century: maids.
NBA star on green chive.
Curry's fighting for cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not get lost in the premiere of professional golfers, despite a botched first hit.
The two-time NBA award winner played the first round of 74 shots at Ellie Mae Classic's lower series Web.com Tour in Hayward, California and will fight for cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won a second title with the Warriors team in the NBA this season, began very nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left behind with a balance of four shots above par ten professionals.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first strike, but then it got a bit comfortable," Curry said, with a huge fright falling on him.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you had told me that I would have played 74 in the first round, I would have taken it immediately," he said.
If Curry manages to fight through a cut, which is likely to be set two blows below the par, he will be the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of my stage fright, I think I can," said an enthusiastic golfer who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward he starts for the first time at a tournament that falls under PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic he got a sponsorship exception and maintained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unmistakable feature of Trump’s era is political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro scale, break down entire families.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers were swarming with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
All we're saying is we're just waiting for them to loosen our nerves.
But less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to unite his family.
I'm talking about this because my cousin, a poet and a left-wing fan who lives in Chicago, visited me in New York this week, and who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that closeness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings she's been bickering with about politics for years - is on the same page.
At dinner at the family table, it is a good thing; but I am struck by the fact that it poses a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
Speaking of "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the terrifying possibility that one day his clownery may lose its attractiveness.
But there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the epitome of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will suffice for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We used my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park to the largest carousel run by the New York Park Department - for your three dollars, you won't find a better use, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and in horror they look at their own shoulders - a completely gloomy look and the tinky music is strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many cliches will soon get tired: the view from the high-rise buildings, the skyline looks at you, instead of breathing on you with the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still did not get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - not including Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the London metro station.
However, the carousel in Central Park has a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two two - year - olds enjoy it as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate the carousel, it would deserve maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week I had a similar experience at the store when I was asked to evaluate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
It's the same in a cafe on the corner of my street, with the difference that I can throw in 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to squirm in favor of shoppers when there's no need.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly evaluated my five-star credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts on his wrists that the prison said he caused himself after he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original murder conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of the morning on Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the closet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he mistook her for a thief.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too mild.
National Prosecuting Authority said that it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the court proceedings will take place this year.
In case of success, Pistorius threatens to extend his sentence up to 15 years.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a baby in captivity was born by a breeding panda that mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas kept in captivity.
A staff member of Zhang Zhong Center told New China that panda farming is at great risk of related crossings.
Only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
There are only 2,000 of them left in the wild.
Trying to mate the captured pandas with the wild ones is such a first step to keeping the pandas safe.
A 15-year-old Cao-cao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists could see her every move.
She met her chosen Cao-cao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male's panda lasted a minute and a half and ended successfully.
This too can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males misjudge the time when the female is ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, cites bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested on August 1 in the morning by the Sithonian police.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation continued.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for BTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities tightened up the rules on free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not permitted.
Checks will take place all season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková appears on 50th place after the first round of Major British Open.
The golf course in the Scottish Kingsbarns managed to score one punch under the par when she played three birds and two bogeys.
Twenty-two-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that she will be cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entry to the $3.25 million grant contest was released to the best American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the record for 64 rounds, eight below par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed down 180 poultry farms because of the incident.
According to Reuters, the Netherlands Food Safety Authority has announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which, according to him, means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk is only a limited number of egg types identified by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a threat to adults, but the potential threat is to children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also proceeded to close the farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians shall take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets problem insecticide brands have emerged.
According to the veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of flea products, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'll miss her, says goalie Sedláček and looking for engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe one day I'll go back," smiled 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in a Zlín jersey.
Depends on whether he gets an engagement by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I did at school, it'd be three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year, I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only won five points, so the coaches started shooting it.
At the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for the next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who must change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play to the blanks.
Less shoots, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic after all.
Did you have trouble traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually designed to play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians even feel about their club in KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball, it's a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even if it didn't work out, a lot of people walked.
Did the work of Dinama in KHL help Latvia to almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time on, their results started going up at the World Cup.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading for the Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts got his way in Zlín and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
How come so many of them come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of engagement?
I knew at the beginning of February that I wouldn't continue in Riga.
That's how we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the finals, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín, waiting for something to turn up.
Aren't you nervous?
That was four years ago when I left here and I didn't know what was coming.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after a while.
I caught something at the KHL, so I'll take it another way.
The only question is, when and where do I sign?
How realistic is the possibility that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what happens in a month, where things turn out.
Now all I can do is wait and see what the agent can do.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season wasn't enough for me to choose.
So I'm waiting for a phone call.
The government fling at Lete continues.
In January of this year I wrote in an article With the care of a proper manager, i.e. about the camp at Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to remind myself of the key passages of the article.
Camp Lety has been spoken of for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it is probably best if they look at, for example, the official site of the cultural monuments of Pietná place Lety.
At the beginning of the historical survey they will learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of Lety village, that from 8.8. 1940 it served as a work camp, from 1.1. 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2.8. 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings that have caused them again human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no doubt that these events need to be remembered all the time.
Nor is it disputed that this remembrance should take place at the memorial at the place of the suffering suffered by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten and in the 1970s a pig farm was built in the vicinity and parts of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but it has not yet.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I'd be obstructing those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what an expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, others say the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it's not gonna be a cheap thing.
Yet only a few hundred metres from the former camp is the memorial, in which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was financed beautifully by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is not likely to be a threat, I think it would be a waste of money anyway.
Does the government have no other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified memorial place, stands by the will of history, practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has happened, and whoever wants to, can bow to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and let's keep the memorial place as thorough as possible.
A responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should handle the care of a proper economy.
At least with one like your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above, I see the motto of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty election proclamation.
This May, I went straight to the place.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking lot, replicas of wooden camp buildings.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with a seating area and a view of its own memorial place, which is made of stones located in a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as appropriate and appropriate.
Archaeological research is currently taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the exposed foundations could be preserved and made visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could strain his efforts.
If he manages to enforce the buyout of a pig farm for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic work as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. citizens and 300,000 UK patients causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy to relieve symptoms, but Washington University researchers have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote intestinal resistance.
The head of the study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once a bowl of scales tilts to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of research, scientists have detected the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing turns out to be true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
The postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, as part of a study of some kind of immune cells supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice separated the cells.
Inferred from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse’s bowels were tested by a DNA pooling method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing from the second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbiome - so they did not develop this kind of immune cells - were given L. reuteri bacteria - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immunity cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the fluid, it has been shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been detected in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably pursue the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers signing the contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be “genial”
Manchester United got "genius" on his team in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the mid-term debuted in a Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a 40 million-pound contract, presented himself in the first match with a win of 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed his role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team’s preseason Asian tour, Matić was not in shape and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinha said should be worked on before the next season of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent, and has brilliant thinking - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukak also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho slowly starts to form their eleven for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign with three other players, but insists that the club did a fantastic job and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me win three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Ládi Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to emerge thanks to the new show on TV Prima Zdenek Academy.
The pear immediately smelled the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you," he asked in the social media video.
And since those two have been on edge for several years, he has not forgotten to be irritated by Lada even this time.
"In return, I can teach you what's good about diet chicken, American cucumbers, or buy you a drink and show you why fried cheese is popular," Pearka said.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to step up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss says," said Lightning.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to the participation of Pearka in the culinary academy, considering the matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
Pearek hit Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
In a few days, she sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new show that Prima presented at the press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme yesterday is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from among the audience and introduces them to 12 chefs in twelve episodes.
In the last episode of his show The boss is cooking in November 2014 Zdeněk had his shirt ironed with a crossed-out pear on his back.
If he had my face in there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'll just smile over the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has plenty of vitamins," said Laďa.
He thinks about Lada's culinary arts.
"Cooking according to Ládi Pearka is not an option at home, because I am not going home to the gastropunk," the boss says.
Zdenek Pohlreich is very much appreciated, even according to him I make chicken for honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show," Pearka did not forgive himself.
He's an asshole!
He's no chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analphabet or asshole," said Pohlreich about Pearek at a lecture.
"I'm not 20 years old to be able to wave my hand at them, but I don't worry about them anymore," Hruška said.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and the house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip put into his body. He can simply wave his hand to unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty - three - year - old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and currently offers the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure of implantation and compliance with treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure lasts 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also offers a service of exchange of door and car locks compatible with microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
One child’s married father had technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple wave of hand.
The White House's prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry last month came at $24,000, according to Navy records issued by the TIME Weekly.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the highlight of the program of 17 July in the White House, which was a show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials were inspecting a product show from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn in the framework of an "extraordinary" event, reports Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the helicopter management.
"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such a significant event," wrote HMX-1's commander in an e-mail to his supervisor, a representative of the Air Force Commander, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at around 7:00 on the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled for 15:00 and will remain in place until the entire place was completely cleared out, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail also said that if there is a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement crew for the return flight will be sent due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew remained in place that evening, along with the helicopter and with them, a unit of security personnel.
The records - received by the weekly TIME - did not show whether the second crew was finally sent.
Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was okay," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," replied the deputy commander.
This show "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event, so Hatch Act would not have applied to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his involvement in the event, the President advocated a health reform that went through the Senate and talked about trying to keep government regulations in check.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them to travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane was driving in the background during his first rally in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is pleased with the exhibition 'Made in America', which was presented by products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn area and rehearse any arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to Made in America was part of the current crew training, said the state official.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew in the framework of “non-president support missions” for the next eleven hours.
The White House said that no more props were paid for from taxpayers' money.
Spokesperson Sikorsky said that the company was not in any way involved in negotiations on the issue of a helicopter at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not retain budget records for presidential flights and the exact cost of the show is, according to the Navy, difficult to determine.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of the DoD's expenditure for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit logs indicate a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below the stated amount.
"It is very misleading to report the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses," Walters said.
‘These estimates shall include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual costs.’
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursements do not include personnel costs, but include the cost of fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
Back then, White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of a helicopter for show purposes.
"The idea of a fashion show this week is to introduce products produced in the USA," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of a helicopter and other military facilities, the production of which involves countless American citizens.
This fact is to be remembered."
It's not clear whether Trump was also looking at a helicopter during his rounds at South Lawn. The only thing to say is that he was behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump approached a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I own three of my own."
A young woman stuck in a swamp near Mácha's lake, police wading to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2:00 a.m.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the marshes.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That is why police officers soon lost touch with her," said police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols set off to a location that she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police had to wade through reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt the ground under their feet again," Baláková said.
And so was the missing person.
The police were oriented on the direction from which her cry for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count down loud," said the spokesperson.
Cops didn't find a woman until 3:15 in the swamps of Borný.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance that was called took her to a Czech hospital.
Joining Grandpa with STAN?
The bride you're looking for is becoming a sales girl.
That's kind of ironic.
With his web-based search engine, it's like a billionaire telling voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that a politically disparate group of less-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national agenda for the House of Elections.
Its election candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, no matter what political opinion he has.
That's how Vít Bart used to start, and it didn't turn out very well.
With his rush to decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, which Gazdík also admitted, Dědek also cancels the popular argument of the chief STAN that the greatest value of the movement is the politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and according to surveys.
Now they can replace the quick-collected unknowns.
The total breakup with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if only a few people suspected of identity at the time, after Grandpa's arrival, the only game of identity is over.
Not only Gazdík has long defined himself against YES Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Grandpa, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My goal is that the YES movement, that is, the Mayors, should gain 20% in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't get the movement wrong.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly no accident.
He often talks about politics like Babiš, but he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been more of a reality show than a real political party for some time now, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to make a desirable bride even more of a sales girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the People's Party, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope we hear from someone.
Police dogs trained in Most by helicopter
Dogs specialized in the search for explosives and search dogs today rehearsed helicopter flights at Lake Most.
The police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the Ústí Region Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training lasts about two years.
At the Most, both adult trained dogs and those who are still undergoing training practiced.
In addition to standard training to detect sharp explosive samples around the lake and to look for a missing figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately after the helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work so that he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"Helicopter arrives, dog goes and immediately searches," Tomášek said.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately on a helicopter ride is removed from training.
"Most of them are kept by dogs for example in the garden," Tomášek added.
Police have 76 dogs in the Ústí Region with various specializations.
German shepherds prevail, but also Belgian shepherds grow.
The dog's taking care of him from the puppy.
"He raises it himself, prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary tests that may reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, he takes the first exam in 20 months.
"He gets into sharp action about two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of police duty depends on the condition of the dog.
They usually serve within eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if they are attended by all members of society, including women, and stated a representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Auxiliary Mission, said that hundreds of women are involved in local council elections, three women are applying for vice presidentship, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his Wednesday statement.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate in them, as well as any related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban have released several threats against the electoral process, which shifts international combat activity to a second level.
For the first time in this year's elections, one democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
Afghanistan’s independent electoral commission stated that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewery re-cooks beer.
A good beer for the re-energized brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobč near Mšeno back to life a few years ago.
The brewery mentioned for the first time in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a steam machine operation.
It followed the years of flowering, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, buildings have served the state estate.
The works of destruction were completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, there was a new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to studying archive materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery is in the same shape as in the nineteenth century when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded with a declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European industrial heritage trails.
In 2015, they festively renewed the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste great Lobe beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the pub in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use Kokořín water in the protected landscape area, malt from lobe fields and žatec hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and 1:30.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
The fort Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř was to be such a unique building on the top of the mountain ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was supposed to be made up of up to 12 bunkers connected by large underground.
This was supposed to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, power plant, engine room and hospital.
The exhibition was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The subterranean is now 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with exposition and underground, the complex also includes an armed building of light fortifications, as well as two built infantry cabins, trenches and educational trail of Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building came on the list next to such sights as the Great Wall of China, Traian's port near Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The monastery of Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged building of a convent above a beautiful garden.
The list on which he got, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
Enthusiasts don't want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next year of the evening for the monastery Chotěšov this Saturday on the fifth of August, where will be performed by Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see fencing performances and you will look at places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Meet the plant with one click.
A new free application Pl@ntNet will help students with the creation of herbarists and ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they have just encountered for a walk, this app will advise them.
All they'll have to do is photograph the plant, and the app itself will know what kind it's about.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education in the Mountain Park in Bratislava as part of the City’s Secret Life project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also participated in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers to the application database.
The newly created French app is available for free download on the website Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of French programmers was to contribute as many people as possible to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can detect.
"The children who can hold the tablet or mobile phone can go into the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of this project.
Based on a sufficiently quality photograph of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can identify its name within seconds, which it then assigns under the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the application after setting up an account with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
GMB concerns about the investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union demands assurance from the managers of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer on the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
For the time being, the GMB trade union of Scotland has stated that the company is silent about any investment in the Tollcross plant.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies among other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said that she invested over £5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and union representatives would be among the first informed in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction director, the GMB’s Scottish trade unions expressed their concern that McVitie’s would “not make promises to finance and modernise production lines.”
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the contractor about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Generations of many families worked here and employees mostly come from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work in the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie's."
Pladis’s spokesman said: “Tollcross’s builder only received a letter from GMB yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we value the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with the employees and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many problems were openly discussed at that meeting.
We spoke with employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and efficiency in operation.
We appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the local site and in case of any changes in the operation of the factory, employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't allow Neymar to take his side after she's put together £ 189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of its record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred up the waters of summer transfers. Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid $89 million for it last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and the world’s best paid professional athlete – after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar has made his deal, despite the fact that the confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world brought to this attention three years ago by the president of the PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach one of their players,” said Al-Khelaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to win one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary line when it expressed interest in PSG Marc Verratti's back-up this summer.
The PSG made it clear that under no circumstances would it allow the Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its presumptuous actions with Neymara’s departure.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump said yes to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not continue to do so.
It also gives the idea of sanctions like straw from shoes.
You can't put these things in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela really set out on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not just acting the way the US President would like it to.
Russia is a chapter to itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even a regular voter, American, European or otherwise, could understand what he was up to and on what rule system the sanctions policy was based on, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely catching up on what President Obama has already prepared, just giving it an implementing stamp.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump wins the US election, he would hug Putin and call off sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
But in practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, but tightened.
But Europe is even more terrified.
German Secretary Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
You mean kosher is just sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council?
But then there are neither kosher nor anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean they're only supposed to use sanctions that are weak enough not to put anyone at risk?
The regular voter's in the dark.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
He now learns that it is the EU's energy security.
The voter's in the darker.
Russia is being sanctioned for being too mounted where it shouldn't be.
China is being scolded for not installing enough.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All those punishments or just reflections have their own rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babiš: I do not consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Apart from the Pardubice Region, she has already finished all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed to be led by the governor and shadow minister of education, YES Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a Governor," Babiš confirmed.
You've upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities alone, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are voting directly for the President, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about interference, they might as well be there.
The question is, how many are there going to be?
When I presented your book, what I dream of, when I happen to sleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about abolishing the council.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct choice and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is accused of building little and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, have run in our history.
Which is not to say they did it right.
But the current Prime Minister is not running anything, he's just moderating the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
All we have in the program is a one-wheel drive to the Senate.
We have also proposed a slippery mandate for ministers and the regulation of the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to avoid unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to perform at the meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will govern the government, control the House with 101 Members, abolish the regions and the Senate, and take over the country through grateful mayors and mayors.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron announced a third reduction in the legislature, while there are 57 000 French for one legislator, while it goes to 17 000 Czechs in our country.
But no one accuses Macron of jeopardizing democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election majority, we have mechanisms to prevent him from making dramatic changes.
But the temptations for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look in Poland or Hungary.
There is no danger of that in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team to work for the people in the government, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services would increase.
Why did they outvote me and add 21 percent to the GIBS, who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers act in vain, confuse the government with a travel agency, and for the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers aren't supposed to argue in government, they're supposed to argue outside of government.
There's no room for coalition fights, power vote and business, that's where the decisions are to be made.
How do you plan to have a team of comrades when ministers are mostly partying?
There's a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition treaty did not apply, and he kicked Babiš out of the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a person and has control skills, such false gestures are not needed.
They measure everyone the same, and they all require perfect performance.
Do you know who you'd suggest to be Secretary of Finance?
I don't even think about it, because we probably won't even be in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did that terrible.
There's not that much skepticism in place.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, with the People's Party, he may win the wing of Jiří Čunek.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out the coalition with ANO, in the ODS, Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not be opposed.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the occastics are considered as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet for Vít Barta for VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
Of course, he's a distinct personality.
A little brown though.
If I take his program, he has a broad involvement in the management of society, a direct democracy, one can agree with that.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you at gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We don't consider working with Mr Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It'll be about negotiating a winner with a second in line, but God knows who's going to be a winner and who's going to be a two.
Of course, it is important that they be able to agree on a coalition government agenda.
Let's get back to your efforts to run the state like a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka lets everything go away, never made a decision.
Coalition issues like CEB or EGAP didn't work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, ČEZ took over the Czech government.
It is incredible that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by ČEZ management, which imposes on the Finance Minister how to vote at the CEZ General Meeting.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staff conditions in the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of CEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm gonna be Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
A good cooperation with the ČSSD would like to trade for an even better one with the YES.
Maybe after the election, it'll all go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any Pokor or Růžička lobbyists, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not dealing with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you are in charge of the government, will you seek to exchange the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticise?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, it never drove it, it was only there to number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter to me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, stick them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should fund and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have any authority to fire anyone.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay around 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions run.
How come they don't know?
The House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of ČT and ČRo.
Look how these reports are being discussed, the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from the investigation files and to the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was stupid enough to let Kalousek push me out of government, which added a percentage of TOP 09, but ČSSD took them down.
They're afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, so they're talking about a threat to democracy by Babiš.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President of YES Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power base by placing his son on the Supervisory Board of Teplárny Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or České dráhy for a related lawyer Květoslav Hlín?
That's where we have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I've blamed him a few times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Finance Minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, never had a corrupt affair, no Pelta, no Kratochvil, no March.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we fired that person immediately.
I'm uncompromising in this respect.
If something like this happened, we'd get rid of anyone, no matter who it was.
