At the end of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange fell into a negative
After this morning's sharp collapse, Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions in CEZ shares reached almost half of the daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange has followed up on its Monday slump since the start of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell by almost 6 percent.
This time, the fall in shares on Wall Street is behind the fall.
In our country, too, the market's response to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
The Fall of Shares in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday was experienced by stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Exchange index in Hong Kong wrote off almost four percent during trade, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has fallen by 3.8 percent, and in Shanghai the markets have been closed.
Sydney Stocks lost more than five percent, but eventually lost 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock market, according to its index, has fallen by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of a rescue operation in the US is uncertain and it will affect financial markets around the world," said Chief of Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy separately, i.e. without dependence on China’s central bank.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly return to negotiations and approve the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, they say there is a risk that other countries will feel the effects.
American Stock Blood Bath
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to spend up to $700 billion (almost CZK 12 trillion).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index has dropped by almost seven percent, and the drop to a similar extent was the last recorded in 1987.
The index was falling before the vote, but once it became clear that the proposal had failed in the House, the index was in free fall.
Congress retreated: The US government can pump $700 billion into banks
US Congress leaders and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the American financial system.
The vote on it will be at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in talks about approving a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately CZK 12 trillion).
But it is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final draft of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House Barney Frank told Reuters.
According to sources, the Senate could probably vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, there will then be a "s sobering" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences about what the form of the market stabilisation package is supposed to look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with US finance minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give a definitive form to the government fund.
This should buy unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which are pulling financial firms into heavy losses and threatening the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement of a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue our recovery plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is affecting stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's democratic senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear, for certain, when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, nor whether the negotiations at the last moment can be stuck on a problem.
Lawmakers hope to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will admit a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program does not perform its function, in the sequence of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations
While the President may veto this decision, Congress may overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value had fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgages, remained preserved.
"We've worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates the "both-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies".
Limitations on golden parachutes
Senate Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the money program, protection of taxpayers from losses, closure of concessions, timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called gold parachutes for directors of the company participating in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
That should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful to the market for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new mortgage payments that it buys in order to reduce the monthly repayment costs for debtors and allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to chief economist Patrio Finance David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"That is because it is not known what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets will be redeemed.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will divide their losses," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, Mark says it's not that important.
"It is much more important that this week the Congressmen agree to support this plan and to sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is the most important thing at the moment," Marek emphasized.
Knife blade fight: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll advise on how to choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
From that it seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to buy a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the demands of the future owner.
It's hard to get home a high-end expensive record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
For one thing, such music products on LP boards do not come out and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if your vinyl shelves contain art rock, jazz or blues, you may at least dream of such a gramophone.
It is the same with music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for some to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life also determines
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most cell phones can't do.
No modern device is as universal as a phone.
Besides primary functions, phone calls and text messages, he can play music and video, record both, have a better one, the worse one, and maybe even navigate.
And considering smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of a cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the display indicator sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than 10 12 hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap phones, therefore, count on them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you make any more calls here and there, get one more charger at work just to be sure - that's also true for more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem arises when you record music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the device has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but few card readers can handle miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
You don't need any special software for players except for exceptions (iPod).
Just fill the device with USB music from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library by the name of the performer, album title, genre or user evaluation.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories like the Explorer in Windows and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones are more capable
When selecting a specific device, you should especially care about battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and of course also about the comfort of the control.
If music is primarily a set and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram, you just need any cell phone that plays MP3.
Which almost any cell phone can do.
You don't even have to watch too much of what music formats a cell phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and besides it, the vast majority of the instruments can also handle music in WMA format.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods) is less frequent.
Better mobile phones also allow for example buying music online.
Just visit the respective website of the operator (or another provider) via mobile Internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already in itself be a strong argument for the acquisition of a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to fast-fermented radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this method of selling music (either through GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) is dominated by the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones around all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you feel the phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every cell phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of music cell phones will be the prize for many.
The cheapest ones are normally under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll already have a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to common headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped phones even with a 3.5 mm socket for common headphones cost up to 15,000.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy to operate.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can really control everyone.
Minimum functions, similarity of control with a previously common tape recorder or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile Internet and subsequently a giant data transfer account.
What kind of device to reach for?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card you can fit into 2,000 crowns.
Be careful, though.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 CZK.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, reach for specialized phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokies and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the operator comfort is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
The farthest is in Sony Ericsson, whose walkman cell phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand CZK, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours), will take MP3 players away from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services such as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet we're missing something here - a virtual operator who would make the classics cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written on Mobil.cz many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
After all, CTÚ confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps taken by the European Commission in the area of roaming charges regulation, the paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrations over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to play on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with his own network probably doesn't have much chance (after all, it would probably be hard to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant price reductions, to which even classical operators had to respond.
Even before the entry of a pike such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market, similar voices were heard in the UK as in our country.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, even a bet on a fresh target group can be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Administrative men vote Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could be followed by us.
The spokesperson for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts about this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, Spokeswoman of the financial group Penta, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not in favour of this idea.
Rather the opposite, they try to do everything they can to prevent any potential competitor from being created.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden for a long time by the GTS Novera Group, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them in the negotiations," says the group press spokesperson Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's time for a better time, then.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to maybe the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Srsen, of the O2 Telefónics Press Department, said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
Press spokesperson for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2: "We have not yet noticed any viable and mutually advantageous business project on which to build further."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it's hard for any virtual operator to appear.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to be able to think in this short term."
Vodafone pays attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider most beneficial from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a fall in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when operators care about something, they are able to pull together is also evidenced by the movements around the formation of U:fona.
Probably the biggest pressure towards CTÚ went at the time of the creation of U:fona from the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
But now U:fon is useful as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would impose high demands on him and above all on his services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, it is directly striking the total lack of interest of Czech regulators.
This is not just about the Czech Technical University's position, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - has no power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stand on the issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator to rent the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS External Relations Department said in response to our inquiry.
It may not surprise the representatives of the operators of such a worded statement.
From an office to represent consumers' interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market, it is more than considered.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not part of the interests of the Authority.
In fact, the whole case is shockingly touchingly matched by the three mobile operators that result from their reactions.
The question, if this is really just a coincidence, is offered entirely by itself.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is certainly only a result of chance and a hard competitive struggle.
"The Authority did not find signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - it is always necessary to agree with the network operator to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on his network.
So in a certain segment, it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to ÚOHS that three mobile operators are doing similarly.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the said GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
Assessing responsibility on the CTU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which the ÚOHS keeps away from the whole matter.
We've already met him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CTU's powers to competition in telecommunications has failed, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the OHS must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's okay when no one's watching.
However, the operation of pseudovirtual operators, several of which exist in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own mobile phone service prices, but which are only partially public.
They are usually multilevel marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The prices of these companies usually come only to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic company customer with a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar sales.
"If there are cases you are talking about, this could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová answered.
However, it is highly unlikely that such activities would not reach responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are prevented from doing so.
In fact, the activities of these companies have considerable profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law of such speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot have it fully as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that's what the CTU should be at least weird.
In addition, another question is open for the OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to similar procedures, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the OHS has relatively strong powers to detect similar activities, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the operators’ explanation that they have no idea of any such activity and their business conditions forbid it.
When We Won't Be Most Precious
As has been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought down prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these moments that regulators intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, and others were packing on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are switching the whole case like a hot potato.
From our experience, we can't shake the impression that the lack of clarity in their competence is more than useful to them in these cases.
But let's not blow our brains out.
If the backroom information is correct and the virtual operator really appears in our country soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If any of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will hardly be possible for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling out more than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of Czech State Day festively introduced new recordings of the state anthem Where my home is.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took the singing.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Belohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymens.
He had already told Czech Radio that he deliberately chose singers with young representative voices that are prominent and popular to sing solo variations.
"From the beginning, I tried to be careful with both of them and then with the congregation to have a clear diction, so that the text could be understood so as to be compatible," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovačka Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her for their own.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem sounds like
Prague public transport on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and bus station, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, it can be purchased by roughly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will apply from 1 January 2009) and also have their chip card uploaded to the infocentres and workplaces of the Transport enterprise in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz from yesterday.
Over 400 customers took advantage of the service until afternoon hours.
Those who start using the Internet shop can definitely forget about the window at the metro stations, where they have had to stand regularly in long queues on paper tickets.
The coupon will be purchased via the Internet and uploaded to the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"At these places, the passenger desk with a trained staff is available to help interested customers with online purchases and also uploads a coupon on their card," said the spokesperson for the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service slot machines, which are installed in several subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket marks, and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltava.
"Now there are five in the city, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," he added.
Coupon checks the driver's seat slot
The vending machines that start working tomorrow are simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip into it and the coupon previously paid will upload itself to it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
Thus on suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which are used mainly by the inhabitants of Central Bohemia.
"On trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, conductors are equipped with card readers, using them to determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal, of Ropid organization, which sets timetables for Prague public transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built in the driver's box office.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver, but it is also necessary to attach Opencard to the designated location on the side of the cash register.
This will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If passengers need to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and do not remember when the coupon expires can go back to self-service slot machines where coupons are recorded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the instrument display.
The Sudetens wanted a referendum from the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested the inclusion of Shumava with the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America at least.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter from the American President not to allow the "Shumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to return to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that American troops come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, signed by the words "The people whose fate lies in Šumava's heart".
Since joining Czechoslovakia allegedly gives Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of a letter from the US President to take over the Protectorate for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign country that oppresses and disproves minorities and nothing, has contributed nothing to the Allies' victory," says the letter.
The reason why authors cannot sign is said to be a fear of the vindictiveness of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the US allegedly doubted the thinking of the Shuva Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Shuva County on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately illustrates the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that this would be their removal from the republic, few of them even allowed such an option.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was like a Budějovice German stationed in the Baltic Navy during the war.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holštýnsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home they would need Czech," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected to be removed from the republic on the basis of Beneš decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Still, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ales Řebíček's office promises to keep the driver away from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, on the Internet, as well as on flyers.
It should dissuade the driver from speeding and alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to buckle up before they leave.
He wants to touch his conscience mainly with young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign says:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And then the word "pay" is in the pool of blood.
This is to symbolize that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one’s own life.
The audience will be "frightened" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic pictures of victims of accidents are commonly seen.
He promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for the driver
"The system of carrots and whips applies to the driver.
The sugar for them is that, for example, when they run a red light, they save time.
The whip is a threat to a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist at the hospital in Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, meaning psychologist.
According to him, boards that alert the driver to danger are less effective.
"If a static warning board is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surrounding area and the drivers will not attend to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordánska, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview that was published on Monday by Jediot Akhronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories will have to be returned, if not all," Olmert said to the daily.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give Palestinians a similar percentage (the land of Israel), because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked in a reference to two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places", which lies within the Old Town.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he emphasized.
Leaving Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s departure from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the departure from Golan," he pointed out.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shia movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support provided by the terrorist (the Shia movement) Hamas, (the terrorist networks) Al-Qaeda and jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards illegal on the bus?
The law doesn't know them. You can't walk on a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padova, Italy, the question arose as to whether the stewards and passengers can move on the bus while travelling.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a 22 - year - old stewardess last week seems to have been caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, at that moment, the girl sat next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role plays whether the bus according to the technical license is equipped with standing places.
If the bus is not approved, passengers must sit down.
Long-distance buses Student Agency do not have standing spaces; this has also been confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I have dealt with, and at first it has not allowed passengers to move.
Then they called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the bathroom while they have their seats," he said.
The law doesn't know the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation nor prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," Hanzelka says.
On the contrary, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends whether the bus is allowed to stand in homologation.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where standing spaces and limited maximum speed, urban spaces with higher permitted speed standing spaces and long-distance seats with the highest permitted speed and seats fitted with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
The BESIP expert on traffic security Jaroslav Hořín in the movement of stewards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"When driving smoothly, there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
Even here, it's not certain when the turbulence comes and the stewardess can hit her head."
"However, if the bus brakes sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on the city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by the carrier by internal regulations," he says, and he also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
The Agency student offers steward services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"As soon as I get the impression that the stewards' profession is risky, I'm going to cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on arrival.
It would save costs," he says.
As a safety concern, Director Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his vehicles.
"We don't have stewards, we've been up against this since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end in some fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Výden.cz.
There's been a great tragedy.
A young steward from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident of a regular connection to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably swerved off without using the stop sign and blocked the bus route.
His driver tried to avoid a violent maneuver, but he struck the right front.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold out, Jančura refused.
"These places can't be booked for long-distance connections, they're blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ortel, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit as well.
A law amendment?
Out of sight
Specification of the movements of the stewards on board the bus could bring an amendment to the law, which has been worked over the year by a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, there was no specific conclusion.
Buses don't even deal with much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of a mobile while driving," says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be a major threat to the safety of passengers," Hanzelka says, adding that bus safety checks are the responsibility of the police and labour security authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The large words in the letter of the Board of Directors WestLB to the employees of this bank are not missing.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the French Deka-Bank, "the central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trading in capital markets will be created," we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring in the "competition" for long-term returns in this transaction.
And it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further association in the Landesbanks sector.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act during a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which savings customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
At the presentation of the six-month management results at the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas heard that he did not see any sense in the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with any of the Landesbanks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, for which it stands from one half of the Landesbank and from the other by the savings banks, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct interviews with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about capital market transactions or some of them.
But the talks have only just begun, and the financiers are touching.
Deka-Bank, one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that the Deka-Bank merger could take place with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and with Helaba.
In the end, there was nothing from this triad.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessian government opposed Helaba's participation.
Both the other banks didn't connect that way either.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz received Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, speculation has repeatedly emerged about the connection of Deka-Bank with the Landesbanks.
However, recently, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, commented negatively on speculations about the merger of his financial house with others.
It seems, however, that independently, it matures the belief that the approximation of various public sector banking houses is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Land Assembly in Bavaria, BayernLB’s merger with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to begin.
That's not good news for Helab.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, it gradually loses potential partners for such mergers.
In the south, she would only play second violin, despite the fact that the financial crisis has so far faced much better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the merger with WestLB banned the Hessen-Thüringen savings banks association, which has an 85 % stake in Helaba.
Nord LB, at most, would have been considered.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions match.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of Landesbanks has not yet been answered by the German savings banks and giro banks.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, nobody wants in this institution.
That is why the letter from the Board of Directors there says that they are trying to make a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual folders to Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "a weekend with the Italians"
It's the first time for Elena, for Luca, for the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena's gonna be his girlfriend, and he says everything's gonna be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre cask of Kaiser, stands a stronger beard, and 200 tourists on Oktoberfest prove how deep his throat can be tones.
Elena's gonna slap Luca first, and then she's gonna kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, this evening at 23.45 four buses will take off marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
The three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, on one bus only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans were already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
Marco, who is wearing a long coat with a pelt lining and glasses with wide silver frames, belongs to the three buses.
He's been riding with them on Oktoberfest for five years, and he's holding three expeditions this year alone.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10:30, leaving back.
Overnight would only cost unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcoming toast to Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses go into the night, after the car drive towards Brennero.
Beer's not served, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers are asleep.
Well done, they'll still need their powers.
They stop at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where they take one more break on Highway 8 in front of Munich and many other buses with Italian license plates.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese as scheduled at 6:30 in the morning, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's last speech explains the plan of attack.
One, put your yellow hat on.
It says "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to Marco's travel agency's internet address: "conoscersiviagggiando.it".
Two: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" calls Marco to the morning air.
"Go!" Go and fill the back of the tent.
"Not in front of you, and not all yellow caps on the same bench, spread around the space!"
It costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the students that we're being nice.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Three: "Be back here at exactly 10:30 tonight!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, room with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as marks on trees, signs, and even on the election poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare to retreat.
The weekend with the Italians is the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Accurate figures about the number of visitors are not available; there are 50,000 people who travel through the Alps and invade beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The ranks of the Munich police will strengthen seven policemen from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which holds national statistics in which Italians take first place before the British (about 60 strikes) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments.
The tent Hofbräu is especially popular with the Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück pointed out that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is a good thing that this politician used the word "relatively" and also confused his claim with the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared crisis development.
Because that's what happened last weekend.
With the Dax index, the monitored financial house specialising in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan of several billion to protect against turbulence in the markets from the consortium of German banks.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit assistance would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from a truly exhausted amount.
They say the money comes from private and public banks.
The losses of Depfa's subsidiary are in the background.
According to the newspaper report, this state financier was extremely refinanced for long-term projects for which he lent money in the short term, which is no longer possible because of mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrunk by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and slightly decreased its equity ratio from 1.6 to 1.45 %.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, yields from increased value of receivables and from certain securities and also from the abolition of credit trading reserves fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher return on compensation for the subsequent settlement costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the interest compensation under the tax rules and for the brokerage of trade for the group companies, the 16 % decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on mortgages for business owners, which were then decommissioned from the service portfolio and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little money in the classic state funding, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint private investors and state projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write something off from the value of its subsidiary, and these write-offs will have a "essential material effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the whole group, as some have let themselves be heard vaguely.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
It has already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depfa.
Stronger than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago practically dried up the spring of interbank loans, because banks are safeguarding liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for part of Depfa's loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros per year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this loan for the foreseeable period of time and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently largely incompetent functions".
Other sources have been heard that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, President of the Board of Directors of HRE Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets anytime soon.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
That is what shareholders and creditors of the bank hope.
But with regard to the dynamics and incompatibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan does not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After a late Sunday afternoon bank apparently stood before the insolvency, however preliminary, the rescue could not calm the passions.
The stock rate fell 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, the bond classes were well held.
While preferential debts have practically not moved, they are losing secondary bond rates more significantly.
This concerns mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically the bonds with maturity after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the emission banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to expect to pay the securities within their due date.
But there may also be what almost no one dares hope for at present - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming along with this partial nationalization, the probability bordering with certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This will likely prepare a number of awake nights for especially long-term creditors to decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the marginal line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rate yields later in years for the purpose of future payment of capital revenue tax.
Sylvana and the secret box bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop introduces herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, girls start to piss: the German woman is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows that word from the mangos, and on her new blog, she's talking about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was terrified of going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way. Fortunately, I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students will start meeting after 8 p.m. and 20 minutes before 9 a.m. begins a short session with a teacher called 'home room'.
But before school started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students in front of class.
Since I haven't worn my school uniform yet, I wore my host mom's old skirt, my blouse, my blue socks, and my black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench dressed like this and tried to say everything right: 'Sajónara Wo š Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is next week.
At that moment, I was very happy to learn the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and waved, and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangoes.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly set sail to my place.
The girl next to me smiled pretty wide, she thought it was an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was quite calm, but when the gong came out, they literally filled me up.
They talked over each other and giggled and asked me about both possible and impossible - and yet it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all unpacked their blinds.
My host mom also made me this lunch box - and that's different than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu batter.
I usually have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums, eh?
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a kid a custom-made bento, which is especially artistically modified in this case, hoping to get to know the boy at lunchtime.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I've liked to read mangoes for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning a little Japanese once.
So it was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a thing for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach escapes danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
But how could it be verified that they feel the same way when they behave like we do?
For several years, the Web magazine "Edge" has published contributions from well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in her series presents selected answers to the question "What do you consider true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to engage in another kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter into an impassable terrain because hardware does not match.
When a rat comes into danger, he does what many other animals do: pretend to be dead, flee, or attack.
People behave in a similar way, some scientists conclude that there is a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal life.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include side prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if language consciousness did not matter, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, however designed, would probably differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's hard to figure out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure even, because of special hardware, to analyze it based on our own experience, it puts us at the forefront of great problems.
Most of my outlets relate to the content of conscious experience, but besides that, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more accessible.
It would be possible to examine animal consciousness processes regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in visualization.
But this approach, addressed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlations of consciousness rather than on causal mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I conclude that an emotional system, such as a fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) utilizes the memory.
Seen from this angle, the feelings are closely linked to those areas of the cortex, which are characterized by primates, and especially by humans.
In connection with language nature, there is a subtle degree of variation of perception, because by using words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states to attribute them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of Cortex and the brain stem devoted to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in feelings perceived by several animal families.
In theory, I cannot resist this, but I find it inconclusive.
Pankseep argues that what seems like fear to us in rats and humans probably feels the same way: But how can it be verified, does Pankseep also say whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
Does the cockroach flee from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, mere similarity cannot prove the congruency of the experience.
True, the neural comparison moves us on: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can look forward to progress on the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Just as I don't study the language and consciousness of rats, I don't study the feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than to throw myself against the wall repeatedly.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: A time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be managed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But it is not amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is much to do in both countries."
In the early fulfilment of the timetable of the construction or rebuilding of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are limping.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will fall from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said Grigory Surkis, Chairman of the Ukrainian Union.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
Following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the leadership of the Polish PZPN Union was recalled and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecký.
There is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to follow the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish press agency PAP.
"We have assured President UEF Michel Platini by letter that he will not suffer this step in preparation for the 2012 ME."
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to forced descent last season due to manipulations, and eventually they had to move quickly to the beginning of the league.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new film, she talked about private matters - and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He's furious, and he's hitting back.
Late Rose War with former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having a nasty dispute - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, for the first time, expressed her reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she didn't know the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The idea for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - he tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's response to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "It's crazy," said a 55-year-old New York Daily News actor that "Meg repeatedly chews and adjusts the history of our relationship."
Moreover, it is "politic" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a twin father.
He ends up thinking about cheating like this: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have an amazing family that thrives."
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have again reduced - this is the result of a study by the provider of American Express travel and financial services.
The company analysed its data on bookings made from the first half of 2008 and after the price rise in the first quarter found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market grew for several years, accommodation in many places has already reduced.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities watched increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most subtle was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express considers this trend to be the cause of a weak dollar exchange rate that has caused "the declining taste of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices was also more affected by financial centres than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices even recorded a European record with an increase of 26.3%.
Also, ticket prices showed an even higher trend in the first quarter:
Because of the increase in kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, the fuel-intensive long-distance flights even increased by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices in the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but changes in knowledge were less pronounced in Business and First-Class classes.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, it grew by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter it dropped by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, according to the quoted study, prices even fell by half.
One reason for this price fall is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, because of the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit lines by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods Hamburger SV gets to the head of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay no longer manages to assemble a working 11.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player got into the game late and failed with a ball on a stick.
His report was accurately formulated and sounded convincingly out of his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the Hamburg Arena cabins.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the break between halftimes ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
For almost three decades Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
So his request was also answered in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol came in and raised his thumb as a sign of a match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His orders were probably similar: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"There was no good looking today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it more relaxed.
For 1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgers owe to the head of Mladen Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbashians could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Martin Jol.
This Monday, the Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and a live updated video screen in which their team was listed as a premier.
It'll be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the ongoing table result symbolizes the incalculability of the League rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goaltender Petrić and FC Bayern acquired by Jansen - is slowly located, but it is not yet able to flash.
"We need more feeling and more dribble," Jol emphatically said.
After the defeat in the vote
There's a lot of fear on Wall Street.
The first reports on the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow put on some weight.
Around 20.30 this world's most important stock exchange barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The technological exchange Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in the minus at 1548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this point the American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs shares lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
Under the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the whole amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive stock options from financial companies that could be reimbursed in the course of favourable exchange rate developments, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock courses in Europe are falling sharply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not rid investors of doubt.
The share rate of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is heavily descending and withdraws the Dax index.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing the state despite the planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular exchange-rate losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have torn the German share index (Dax) down to a negative.
Despite the rescue action of the Federal Government and private banks, up to three quarters of its value, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent of its value.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent he scored 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York City, the Wall Street business day began with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion US government bailout package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, or 3.3 percent, and is at about 10 809,25 points.
The American House of Representatives has a vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could comment on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges went in only one direction: in London the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index dropped by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286,90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506,43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595,75.
In MDax, after the announcement of an increase in the core capital, Arcandor shares were lost.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
Moreover, the business and tourist group announced that it would not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have not been able to cope with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses space probe flew through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, are now threatening to die of cold.
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists for years - an anomaly of the gravitational slingshot.
Gravity slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some cosmic body, such as Earth.
Thanks to that, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case in wonder: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect under the old law of gravity.
On the contrary, irregularities occur at speed.
The probes are accelerating or slowing unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was christened by an anomaly of a gravitational slingshot.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and he is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The answer for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space explorers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It's obviously derived from a gravitational force that can be seen as an effect on other cosmic bodies.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, or visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the announcement of the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, kidnapped tourists are again at large.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six hijackers were reported killed in a shootout before they were released.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
I hear the ransom hearing's on.
The Germans have repeatedly become targets of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists introduced to the Sahara seem to be free.
The Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabíja, and the Italian media informed about this.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were liberated.
We are currently verifying their medical condition," Frattini said.
According to the report of Egypt’s state television, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He said, "It was just about taking over the hostages," when it suddenly came to "this surprise."
On Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The "El Masri El Jom" journal, referring to one of the German intermediaries, said that the release of the hostages was stretching because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostages of the female sex after the ransom was paid.
Men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by stepdads "leaded to suicide"
Several years of father-in-law abuse led a woman to kill herself, heard in court.
After confessing to eight sexual harassment cases, 75 - year - old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," wrote Treris in a confession.
It was also said in court that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Treris divorced his wife in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said in court that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time volunteering for the National Trust organization, was persecuted by the specter of abuse that was committed twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife stated in court that in 2006 Ms. Randle's friends, who was also very interested in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to suffocate with a plastic bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words, "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, the matter probably wouldn't have come to trial at all."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Absolutely, she'd probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
An official who has lost his data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the Waterloo train at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the law, and there is no indication of criminal intent.
Secretary of the BBC for Defense Affairs Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was handled internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
A staff member who may not be appointed shall be charged under section 8.1 of the law in question, a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police charge the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al Qaeda and the possibility of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
The cooperative banks face the debt of B&B
British credit unions may have to settle more than 80 million pounds after saving Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative banks.
Director General of the Association of Cooperative Credits (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "poor", that the credit cards and their members must pay.
In the end, the 14 - hour - long debt will be repaid by bailing out Bradford & Bingley’s mortgages.
In the meantime, however, interest will be paid annually by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Fund The compensation plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperative banks are accounted for in this issue.
It's humiliating that these institutions, which have been prudent... now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from that prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the credit cards should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
That means that the credit cards will have to find £81 million to pay back the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperative credit union trading association, told the BBC that he was convinced it wasn't fair.
"It is demeaning that those institutions that have acted prudently during the expansion of the housing market must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so prudent."
According to BSA, no credit card has fallen since 1945.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this in the next few weeks to see what the options are for protecting credit unions and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest will be paid for the whole year and this could be almost twice as much.
Given that cooperatives are joint-stock companies without shareholders, their members will eventually pay this account through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk will cost five pence per litre
People in Jersey might have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy has announced that from Monday, it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by fivepence per litre.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and it comes after research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the price increases at customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladesh Expremier Denied
The Bangladeshi court rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid's request for bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the accusation that she received over $50 million from a certain businessman, as well as $729,700, when she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption brought against it.
Khalida Zija, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasinah, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasinah is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), demanded that the local army held by the government first give her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was paroled to undergo a medical procedure abroad, according to the terms of her release, it is not clear whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Shaikh Hasina's request for bail, saying that he does not need bail when he is already taking an exam abroad released for a declaration of honour," said her attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the High Court."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasinah is to return home after October 17th.
She was detained last year after the army held by the interim government took power, but she was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasinah and Khalid Ziyah both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in recent polio vaccination because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the UN performed vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says that for security reasons, she could not reach the children of the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
A UN spokesman said that despite Taliban promises, he would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB lost the ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost the litigation over the review of the Commission’s competition decision, which ordered the company to reduce its stake in the competing broadcasting company ITV.
BSkyB has ordered the appeal of the Competition Tribunal to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % to below 7,5 %.
The Commission has previously stated that the share of BSkyB was hindering competition and giving the company disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a business that, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV, buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB gave rise to doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The head of Virginia Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator of Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its shareholding in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution to the disproportional - mainly because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to waive her voting rights.
New investigation into the affairs of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report on the affair prepared by the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators, and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was fueled by the concern that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "A serious accusation, including a potential criminal act, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006.
At the time, the Ministry stated that the lawyers had been released because of weak performance.
However, it later became apparent that the dismissal of lawyers was no worse appreciated than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to the conclusion that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate the charges against the Democrats for deceiving voters.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was put under fire for layoffs and eventually resigned.
Many other representatives of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of the role of Gonzales in the affair, saying that he was "mainly responsible" for layoffs, that he "abdicated" from his leading position and did not "remarkably engage".
Other officials, including former senior Bush advisor Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will come to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" by acclaim.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song of the Meat Loaf hit album from 1977.
The nominations for this year are led by Coldplay, which entered the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Reese, head editor of Magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached a maximum of 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album has been on the charts for about nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Day - suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was also operated on due to irregular heart rhythms after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscural streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many Veterans taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding the Extra Place, mostly because they never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village district and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic move.
There's no sign of street names.
It's practically invisible in a common atlas.
Yet, it has an admirer’s aisle.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to newly pave Extra Place and create a cleaner access to shops and boutiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say that they were charmed by a short alley simply because it was one of the last remains from before the block was compensating.
However, the City Protection and Development Office, which has the street in its power, has no interest in holding onto it.
At a meeting of the Municipal Community Land Committee, representatives of the Municipal Authority and Avalon Bay drew up a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Suzanne Stetzer, district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee prefers the possibility of the street remaining in the hands of the city and asking for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city owns very little land left, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"Repair and management proposals could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to pave a small street and set up seating positions, several of which would be used by a café, whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this depraved alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Office for the Conservation of Buildings, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the task of his office was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn’s large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, the punkrock monument, which was closed in 2006, led to Extra Place and the alley is perhaps best known as the background of the Ramones album cover "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about processing the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, albeit modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah’s Vanishing New York (with the subtitle “The Book of Moanings: A bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the section Let’s talk about the city that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even during the day, bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and nailed windows, where a week-old newspaper runs through the gutters."
Except for a few exceptions, the aisle of a recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where today a shop with expensive clothes stands.
There was graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty beer bottle next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
A few passers-by said he rarely thinks of Extra Place, but suggested he could use a boost.
Fields, on the other hand, said that he thought that some people underestimated the impact of the alley in its present state.
"Best years of my life," he said, "they were in places dark, wet and disgusting."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this edition, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the attitude of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic worker in California and director of the field of education at Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools".
It's a tricky thing to reach out to Hispanic voters effectively.
Barack Obama's educational agenda proves it.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are considerably less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
In order to fight such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are still learning English.
The question about Barack Obama is, however, whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in class, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles East.
The pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Even so, in the state math tests in 2008, an incredible hundred percent of fourth-class pupils reached the highest level.
Almost the same amazing ninety-three percent of fourth grade students have reached the highest level in state tests in English and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a method other than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Next, and Obama should notice, according to Linda Mikelsová, Principal Sixth Street, the educational approach of the school for those who are learning English, is "complete immersion".
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me, "We've had great success with one brand-new student from Mexico - after 12 months, you'd go into class and you wouldn't know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a role model, what should other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English learning students look like?
The results achieved by the school should be taken for granted from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a longstanding supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education makes the prediction of Obama’s answer unclear.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about "English only" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about educational models that work rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the US plan to save the financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell by up to 7 percent in the morning trade on the New York Commodity Exchange to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
Over the past two weeks commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as by a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices dropped earlier this month to almost $90 a barrel, and then, again, they jumped on a wave of huge financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congressional Bureau announced that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history this weekend.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy the bank section of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the heated weekend negotiations, which led to a plan to save the economy, "returned as unable to revive the mood in the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates, and exchange rates have become very unsure," the analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread throughout the world and especially to China."

Wild ride in the second quarter beat the team record
After spending more time in the Jets jersey in the last eight seasons than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a sleepless ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals settled their troubled game with gloomy clouds above them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly foresaw the afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved miles forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one where the cornerback fell, and the next 10 seconds before the match.
"It was nothing special," Favre told Coles about all his passes.
"He's a hell of a player.
We had excellent communication, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were tossing, defense attacked Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis picked up a stray throw and put it back 32 yards on the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and picked it up.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into a fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, may have been the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely's twenty-yard goal out of the field, winning the lead 34-0.
That's the most the Jets ever got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
Many points were scored in a short period of time."
Rested Gebreselassia has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon he broke his own world record and became the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning the pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59, he rolled his previous time by 27 seconds 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassia, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - has broken the world record or is at least world champion at all distances from metric miles to marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassia missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon because he was afraid - perhaps too scared from a glance - that polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassia with a flashy average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebreselassia and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on longer lines, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebreselassia told journalists that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the break got him excited rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselassia to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I was a little bit in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, East African rival Ethiopia - because he said he was over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon peaks, relying on conductors, as if it were a race on a track, and building world records above the competition sense.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running qualities.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassia half in time 1:02:04.
After the conductors fell, two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi kept chasing Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles before the finish of Gebreselassia last worked and escaped Kwambai, who then ran second in time 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in time 2:07:48.
In the women's race, an excellent year ended with the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitinková, a native from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitinenko surprisingly won last spring at the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She left out the Beijing Games because of something that was described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon that she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big head start and then reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in time 2:25:01.
Proudness and obstacles to the lives of black people in a separate city
Hidden among the vast amusement parks of the Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy, and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and demands of African-American life come to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville festival Zora! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, even though she made it a stop for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the locals remain cautious about the looks of strangers.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and a community of almost 2400 people, where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is the center of literature, but also oaks, shielded by an example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that came from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the worry about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons call it.
She introduced her hometown to the world through hearty books full of dialects like "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city a bit into Route 17, which leads through the frequently ephemeral center of Florida, into the stage of black history and human drama.
With the big drum in her life and literature, Hurston introduced her readers to the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of every kind and anything that fits into an hour hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville connected with self-government, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Obviously, this wasn't a typical Fodor's publishing house.
Actually, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls' choirs, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Florida's Jacksonville.
Seventy - seven - year - old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time, when she came into town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevy, smoked, and wore pants in the city, which is still proud of dignified clothing.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Franklin, but many scoffed.
"The people of Zoru have always been happy to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, rocking a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed like Eatonville had forgotten about her and the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920 ’ s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived.
There were no major funeral ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its significance for the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography, "wrapped in Rainbows", published in 2003.
Change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to drag the city through the five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way main road.
The discovery of Orlando has already pushed Interstate Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things at people who sat on the side," said Franklin.
"In fact, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In her letter to The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court for forced integration and declared his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber "to my race rather than to celebrate."
The inhabitants now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"Black children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You are not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there is a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights helped create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker reached Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the shelves at the bookstores, praised by Robert E. Hemenway's résumé of Hurston, who put her back in the U.S. Canon.
The highway project arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the ramp lights again.
The former Hurston neighbors now viewed her as a savior.
To show what could happen to his highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five streams of highways have resurrected, you'd say it's detonated, real civic pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
The extra-urban like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began to appear in more numbers, and the inhabitants began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new single-story library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 at the re-esphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act like a lost alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated cautiously.
Permission for most interviews is required to have certain things in advance - like murals in the oldest eatonville church, painted by white people and displayed by black people in fields - not to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes to be richly red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival grew, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, an 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, sincere love of the community sounds when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, who he says could use some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11 - year - old twins of Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, think, 'Well, this town is nothing compared to the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently after church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice town."
Here in New York, we're all fluent in finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glass bee hive offices above their heads every day, bankers and investment fund managers monopolizing New York have the worst "bad day in office" since the 1929 crisis.
Messengers still rumble with metal carts on the sidewalks and transfer muffin pans to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics keep moving between towers and carry, like human mules, 50 ironed shirts hanging from the balances on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it is still not possible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until, with all the pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this assignment to cover up with a late afternoon siesta at my local JP office Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of cash windows to collect or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's mixed goods store and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already collected their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They collected money from so-called thrifts (a little bit like construction savings banks), money associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks went bankrupt quietly.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion worth of assets, went into bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers came home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion worth of assets, tried to catch a bailout.
The employees of the offices and shops standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe harbor and that does most of the saving on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluently in finance over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and to her skinny senior executive, Dick Fuld, with such a familiarity, as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed 50-year-old landlord of my tenement, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it, I won't take any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated after the Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-wing party of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang participates in the demonstration which presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to the organization "City against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed out by the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties made huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were badly damaged between Friday evening and this morning and the police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as the star of David, but the detectives believe that this may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred toward Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident was linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic community here said that they are "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim Lent Moon of Ramadan approaches the end.
Meanwhile, Austria enters the round of finding its own soul after the right swings in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both far-right parties, which gained more than 30 percent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, waged a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the votes, protested against scarves and burkas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in place of the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't take a trip abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, has forbidden the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police were agreed to this travel ban last Thursday after they handed over evidence to officials about Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, on behalf of Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford lowest criminal trial in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The spokesperson for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's lowest criminal trial, the Kent police requested a regulation that would prevent Mr Paul Gadda from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, as it stores a record in the sex offenders' register.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to give the scheduled date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips to the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: "The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to watch someone stay in Britain because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police, and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual attackers in order to minimise any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls between the ages of 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities wouldn't let him pass passport control, and eventually he flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal trial in West London, while at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order that required him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I take pictures of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, freed from focusing on interpretation - I will only achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
An artist on one side.
On the other hand, human.
Inseparable, aside from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see the intimate gesture, depth of the glimpse or passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to step on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" theatrics of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less-known face of masters.
With this intention, the photographer builds a unique iconography of flamenco from various backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place within the framework of the Moon of Flamenco Photography (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international significance of flamenco", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any kind of people, but when you look at photographs, you will find that they are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people portraited "on the street" are artists capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraiting flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble a classic photograph.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical base of the image and lends it the present spirit, an idea that Bauer himself thinks is mirrored by flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which, however, continues to surprise and evolve."
What tears down the audience is not the action of dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of almost 70 photographers creates famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project became a kind of flamenco anthology and will soon see a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
The passion for portraitry led Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea of a "Portraits of a Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "picture people, get to know them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think in the photograph, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
One encounters or encounters people, personalities who sometimes don't even know, or give them only a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Fotómata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he's writing is "trouble."
It takes place in an environment that is not yet known and tells of events unknown to it, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled even in the Amazon.
Yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival, the eternal Nobel Prize favorite admitted that the project that employs him is "presumptuous" and that "all indications are that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it, and I believe that one day I will finish it," concluded his contribution to the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which within four days saw about hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the town of Aqueduct.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the Most Popular Writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had before him a dedicated audience, whose hour of time passed like water - a Peruvian with amazing precision and a great deal of humor remembered how he wrote "disciplined" carefully, corrects and rewrites; or how his writing was influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "remembrance images" were the basis for his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, an elusive experience" - he emphasized Vargas Llosa, saying that "people are affected" and "forced to try to get out of line", and urged the writer to "don't succumb to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of his mission.
Because of climatology, he loses the festival in Pozoblanc - there is no lance
The performance with the lances, which closes the festival in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement by the performers that the square surface was not in good condition was confirmed.
That is why the company, along with Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions plague this festival in the long term, no longer two out of three celebrations could take place.
On Saturday, the rain made the second bullfights impossible.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to stand up to the bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
But this was the only way to celebrate Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance was carried out on his shoulders.
On the same day in the afternoon Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spear wounds for greetings and one ear, which was brought to him by the open seats in the arena rather than the Toreadorian art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the Los Llanos bull arena unhappily bland.
In the second round of hard work, without a single breath of rest, he earned himself a harsh criticism from most of the audience.
They're out of control in Álava in a van with 2,000 pounds of hash.
Ten minutes to five.
Road Control Ertzaintza in the urban district of Armiñón (Alava).
The officers are stopping two people in the van, and they're getting away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Home Office of the Basque Government, the members pursued them and detained one of the people driving in a van, a man 38 years of age who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was accused of smuggling drugs and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a roadside inspection on N-1 in places where they cross the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated and ran.
The passengers immediately started to prosecute the car until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few miles away, at which point both passengers jumped and fled into the forest.
Finally, Ertzaintz’s officers caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as was revealed during the search of the Iveco Daily brand.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "smashed" and did not agree with the information given in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, has managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee A.A.J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department for proper formalities before further investigation was carried out.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda's favorite from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
The witness saw her performing unusual maneuvers while trying to get out of the Montecito parking lot, told People the spokesman for California Road Patrol.
The witness stated that around 16.30 a.m. Locklear "streaked on the gas, drove forwards and backwards during noisy rumbles and tried to drive out of the parking space - she changed her sunglasses several times while backing up".
A witness who apparently didn't recognize the actress first saw Locklear just after stopping on the nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because she was "fearing for Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside a vehicle that had partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented", so members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and the excess amount of alcohol was immediately excluded, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was evident to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 19.00, although several hours later she was released.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Association of IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
Chief General of IU and Member of the United Left Gaspar Llamazares said today that the final decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Council Department of Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of acting for the benefit of his family, would depend on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested, which the party will have to proceed with in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of IU insisted that, in the case of an investigation into the illegal act that Silva committed, "transparency" was absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought to ensure that such matters are as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the Party has a 'strict code of ethics for all public functions'.
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci in May Blood (Sangre de mayo), inspired by the Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós's national past, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way he wanted to "draw the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of the company", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of performers.
May's blood with a medal over two and a half hours will be released to the cinemas this Friday and in the future there will be more than a four-hour series for TV Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garci, he claims that by making this film, he fulfilled the "child's dream", due to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago in the Autonomous Province of Madrid commissioned him to shoot a photo for the 200th anniversary of Madrid's 2nd May, he accepted the offer, saying that the plot would be based on the Epizod national past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the Madrid province contributed completely, means "a unique opportunity" for Garcia to create an environment with sets and costumes corresponding to the image of a "roast Spain who was wrong about the leader for whom it was possible to fight - the fight for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country during the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support received by the films Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goya's Spectres - almost twice as much of May's blood - so he could not shoot some scenes from a script signed by Horatio Valcárcel, with which he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empire) works as usual - along with the actors with whom he usually tries before shooting and who he does not choose with casting, because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas, among other things, to learn what is going on in the craft he deals with".
Many actors selected for May’s blood appear several times before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci with four Oscar nominations, one of which he has won, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May's blood alone, the Seven Tables of the French Billiard and the last chosen Blind Sunflower, represent a young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that 'it will yet appear'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're only working for profit, so you're willing to make one more movie," Garci explains with more than a 30-year director's career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia
Sevilla flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevilla dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusan (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dances and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and she fought for the removal of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, has cast a spell on Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not talking about telling her life, we're talking about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "dance butterfly" evoked guajira or "dance snake" some thong.
Her dance was sensual and told me that my dance of this aesthetic also corresponds," she says.
The performance counts with the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Lead, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La puerto abierta), and with dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she has accepted an offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the co-operation of the actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadonums with all things, and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place at such a distance as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some time, but today nobody knows her and even less appreciates her work," says Bayón.
The show starts today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Newly Married Diary" closes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "The Newly Married Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Trienale of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organised to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
"The Triennial of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with the new edition of this work, the international congress to be held in New York, the reconstruction of the Nobel Museum House and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sun Beam" opened in May of this year, and after going around various Andalusian provinces, should be moved to New York as planned at the time of the congress.
The cultural council of the autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight hundred copies of "The Journal of the Freshly Married" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of the most holy Andalusian poets.
America doesn't like each other that much without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No evil intent" and under the weight of knowing that Newman had left, exposing her dismal vision of abandoned American cinematography and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he was retired from 2007.
And that he was known to be severely ill.
Even so, he was a big man to everyone.
"Sometimes what a man feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better because of it."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
The father of the film and the country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when they desperately seek reasons for pride.
When times are rough and people without virtue and only a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration - there is no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from a drug addiction foundation based on honor of the firstborn son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-cooked food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that took a lot of effort to free itself from a suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, an Englishman named Daniel Craig, stated that one man had not died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar's director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the peak of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to label Newman as his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman - based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, that's what people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he had been married to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, who was faithful, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
May his pride in heaven be with him that his daughters and admirers are in harmony on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was proudest of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a self-sacrifice philanthropist".
Madrid’s Imperfect Races
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the failed year 2012, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my judgment, he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense, that if it were an evaluation and I was an examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one thing at a time.
Nonsense begins with picking up a racing number that makes you have to leave early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give you everything (including a chip to prevent overfilling the track).
Oh, no.
Here you had to pick up a number first (the first nonsense, go there only for that) and (after the proper queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a S-sized T-shirt (the second nonsense, because I need the size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small t-shirts, because it's less fabric and they're cheaper?
Well, that's a little something compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very early for the chip and the queue lasted for over 15 minutes, he had to hand over the backpack.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, something incomprehensible at a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put our backpacks down yet, and when we did, the pickup was much worse.
In addition, the wait extended the rain by 40 minutes, leading to widespread rebellion and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some of us, like me, won't be showing the right time to evaluate the results for the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, did not record my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
So I guess we'll just have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new system of image recognition and human interaction on the manner of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would be moving around the entire premises of the company) and seeing what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort the present by conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that she is not part of the group that talks to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see anyone, and she's telling her that she's going to be with her in a minute.
All without a blue death screen.
It's amazing.
But, of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the necessary, without the burden of commercial unnecessaryness, they'd be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover like thunder, considering that the Microsoft version since version adds new features to Windows and other "extra".
A change of course would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and more to the internet browser.
The computer is turned on to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around windows.
What is the use of half the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a little example.
I took this photo in a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drinking machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft’s employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's just count on 2010.
In Microsoft, they will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone's becoming more and more of a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for delays.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's "Bloody Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppoly's "Godfather", and he's part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to get into the list of his role in life, we can dive into the picture of a typical muscle with a pointed mustache that lifts weights in a traveling circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton men's undershirt, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank', but Le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above all others.
First of all, because of his name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out over other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost indistinguishable) Belgian flag, which models have the most emblematic tank tops as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't just specialize in tank tops.
They also make hoodies college, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, sailor shirts, children's outfits, mini shorts...
Premeditated pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, I don't care who's going to be a father."
The tremendous resemblance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though tiny, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new acting in fashion very seriously.
It means a lot more to Monica than just some pretty, famous girl giving her name.
In Paris, Mango took part in the promotion, which was held by Mango in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion prizes sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's warm and shy, and she'll win you over.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection, which my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango this autumn-winter season, and I also participated in the announcement of the second year of the Mango Fashion Awards and dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
So it was a challenging, yet exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for the Mango company you've been working for for for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s, and we have drawn many suggestions from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around dressed, combine and plant their clothes, that's what I do very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I liked my clothes when I was a kid, and I kept wanting to go to my grandmother's, and I kept waking up in my aunt's closets and looking at her clothes.
That was sensational, almost better than going to the fair.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to watch how I wore my clothes.
You know, we dancers pride ourselves on the way we're groomed to feel good about our hours and rehearsals when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You just turned 30, did the crisis hit you?
Nope.
I feel better than I've ever felt. I'm enjoying my 30s.
I find that the woman is finished, she has experience, and she enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants me to, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness, and I will raise him with great love.
As for the movie, you're about to have a couple of movie premieres you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing them at the movies.
I come from a theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and of course I can't do it.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like them...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the runway next to Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes we've been doing - I've also selected two models from our Mango collection - and the proceeds have been handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of talk about her, and I know her, and I can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity purposes, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do one, too.
I'll do what I have to for the benefit of the women of the Third World.
Drivers caught repeatedly with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Home Office requests that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol have to install a system in his vehicle to prevent him from starting his car drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known already in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its aim is to get the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a course in transport reeducation.
In addition to the National Authority for Transport Security, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Car Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics between 30 and 75 % of the car drivers charged more than once for drunk driving, they will again get behind the wheel in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if the alcohol concentration is higher than the permitted concentration.
Its price exceeds EUR 1,000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that for vehicles equipped with this equipment, infringements decreased by 65% during the first year of implementation.
In Spain, 115 people are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help implement it, as legislation can be done in the usual way, the necessary regulation of criminal provisions requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been installed in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
It is tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE proposal (the Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5.40 p.m., as it was in the program, a Spanish air force plane landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in México D. F., where the prince and princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just set, but its rays had so far forced their eyes to clenched so that the successor couple could be seen coming out of the plane.
Under the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
Yeah, well, that's great, that's not gonna get to the airport to recruit people at that time... she's from around here or whatever.
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport near the red carpet and military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honest salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue color suit and the princess, very modestly dressed and with her hair outstretched, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that there is a storm in D.F.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose them casually.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a talkative Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Best subsidized fashion price
I guess there's no more suitable place in the world to announce a fashion prize than Paris, and there's probably no better designer than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation to new fashion talent.
The price is subsidized by EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, a first-year winner, looked at her designs in the Manga window on Paris’s 54th Haussmann Boulevard and almost cried with emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square metres.
The biggest one is located in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank designer Valentin for taking over the chair of the competition jury, caused us to end up having a fancy dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
Firmou Mango's festively decorated chair table looked even more amazing next to Chagall's finest works.
Nati, who, with a broken heart of grief because of the recent death of her brother, showed nothing, put on the dress of this brand and the jewelry of ELAH, over which the breath was secreted, and hung into her son Luis - a nearly two-metre elegant - accompanied Valentin at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, as a true gentleman, remained with Baron Rothschild without a jacket because they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in her own hand-designed pants and shirt and changed into long black sexy dresses for dinner, moved the night walk through the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledová, showed us the hall for ballet rehearsals and in memory of other times she grabbed one of the poles and indicated "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stay for a tour of the palace buildings, but before she left she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance not to use any fragrances in his rooms.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la la, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about chaotic and furious everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm is ringing at 7 a.m. every morning as punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called suspense and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two methods of combating everyday exhaustion and the problems of getting away from the world of work.
No, the number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside of Yogi positions, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book gathered the whole "menu" options, adapted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The stress book is called "1001 method of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing house will bring peace to the bookstore.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don’t have adrenaline in your veins that restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talk in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they're sleeping.
The first time it happens, it might scare you, but it's actually meaningless.
It is a harmless sleep disorder called the somnolism.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you has been told that he spoke in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (e.g. once in a lifetime in high fevers) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There's only one reason to explain her coming.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nightturna (night urination) or sleepwalking, but it may not be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by a very high fever, stress, or turbulent situation.
In any case, this is a rare phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or quite the contrary (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases of great strength, it would be advisable to observe and consult an expert to see if he has a problem that causes him great anxiety and manifests itself in this way.
We said it was a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do that by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the baby too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
When the somnolique appears, try to remain calm.
Remind yourself that she is harmless to the child and that she will remember nothing of what happened the next day.
Useful Advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're gonna interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and thus rests.
Remember, if several times in a row you feel that they are in great pain, it would be advisable to seek advice or to find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If it is understood what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when she's asleep, she's not conscious enough to get her thoughts straight.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he dreams about, and therefore why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you draw.
Never tell a kid you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Just don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory after a long, thin period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks have created more chances and managed to turn one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this encounter, in which it was difficult for the attackers to push themselves.
After the first attempt of the captain hosts Kauffmann, who shot from a distance just a hair off the link, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemaria's defenses.
On the other hand, the opponent built a defensive wall in the middle of the course and left only agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemaria with the names of Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well situated for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, Golman Illhaeusern did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his teammates at a loss.
However, Dannemaria could not profit from this and the 11 from Illhaeusern, who only withdrew a little to "condens" the defense, no longer causing any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the bridge after the great confusion.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour across Brittany.
In order to face a demonstration of the power of fishermen who, on Monday, had severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports, the French President decided on Tuesday morning to go to Guilvinec port in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to be adopted 'in a constructive spirit', hoping that 'it will come up with concrete proposals'.
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the 'crisis committee' set up by Breton fishermen in order to take action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to the spokesperson for Elysée Palace David Martinon, the President will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions for employing and paying sailors.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with tenacity.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation called "silver" (operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km of constipation.
The leisure port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filtration dam was put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Sailors proved their determination already on Monday, when immediately at dawn before the port fuel warehouses in Brest and Lorient burned tires and pallets, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the canal of la Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawlers remained in the port, or the Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and from Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped during the evening the blockade of the important Refinery Total in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act on their own until Wednesday at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is to decide on how to continue the journey, and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Department of Fisheries, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue," said Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Department.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but consider that the ship’s profitability threshold is reached only when oil is below EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman Magnificent
An unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes bowed to the legend of the film and the politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery conditions for 2008
Brazil’s aircraft manufacturer relies on a supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft engineer in the world, Embraer, maintains his delivery conditions for 2008 with 215 supplied devices, confirmed by his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half, the manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of his planes from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has supplied 41 instruments to Chinese clients in the range of eight years.
They say AIG is considering transferring 15% of its assets.
The American International Group’s insurance company, which the U.S. money authorities have put above water, is considering transferring more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion he was given as an advance, reports the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying a diary that quotes sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to France Télécom, the Board of Directors met on Sunday during the evening to examine the eventual assignment.
Any confirmatory statement could not be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp. subsidiary, its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance provider, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investment, add FT.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, France Télécom continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash in order to repay the loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve provided to it, at the risk that the US authorities seize 80% of its capital, thus diluting it into an appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of historical sitting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic downturn on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank bailout plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of an approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
On 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trading after the terrorist attacks of 11 September, he recorded the largest point drop in his history (about 684.81 points).
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to definitive data after the closing date, 199,61 points and settled to 1 983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Depressed since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally failed after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan by the House Representatives, a plan that was supposed to enable a little stability to be found in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Almost two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent out to the market that sees Congress unable to accept a plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days' time would not come "too late".
"If this project is actually doomed (...), the relay will be handed over to the Fed immediately (the US Central Bank, note red) and to other central banks to prevent the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions more," Brian Bethune, Global Insight economist, warned.
And with emphasis on the urgency of Piegza's situation, she said that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the buy-out of bank Wachovia's banking activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took a turn and demanded urgent intervention for the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not facing "only the US crisis but the world crisis", added an analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The 10-year cash order yield fell to 3.632% compared to 3.827% on Friday night, 30-year yield to 4.161% compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, the debate was followed by a second one, whose task was to find out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The leaders’ tents of the Republican and Democrat campaign were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a TV duel that watched a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, however decent, was not "brillant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in the polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), considers that the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of the polled, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% is attributable to McCain’s victory.
Obama should have the opportunity to confirm his leadership on Thursday by means of the anticipated good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-seven McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time emphasizing his opponent's "naivity" on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was repeated accusations.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also said.
In such an offensive spirit, Republican TV spots have been carried since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and turned out to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does," replied a democratic spot that blames the Republican for not taking enough account of the impact of the crisis on the "normal American".
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina in a rainstorm.
Nor did he utter words like "medium class" or "working class." Financial decay clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider more eligible to save the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"Next week could take a decisive turn," estimated the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For a candidate of democrats, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as George Bush carried it out and how Senator McCain supported it."
The Senator of Illinois has reaffirmed that despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans, and he also pointed out that implementing the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions regarding the $700 billion financial aid plan ($470 billion), which was adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evenings immediately after the closure of the polling rooms on the main square in Minsk to protest against the illegality of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: 'dictator, resignation'.
Some admit that they did not even go to the elections: "What good would it be if they did what they wanted with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Penalties, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the elections were considered to be clean by observers.
According to the opposition, that was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," complained Juri Potemkin, spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasises Alexandr Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leader of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who counts the votes, and in our country it is an executive power.
If any opposition Members get into parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into Parliament can mean space on television, meetings in regions and draft laws."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because 'a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by crises and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has watched the elections, should not declare the elections valid.
It emphasises that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections?" asks the socio-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in Parliament, those who are best suited to the regime."
The night's silence again took hold of the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - Blood that is sure again
Yesterday Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the foundation, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced because Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state reserve of blood administered by the Canadian Red Cross transfusion department was contaminated by the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave of displeasure in the public, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Kráter, to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krhter was delaying his report, some provinces set in motion a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was played by the Gélinea Committee.
Following the Gélineau and Krhter report, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Hema-Québec, who was to manage Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for supplying all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec began his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system," recalls Dr.
"The situation was depressing.
By a consistent effort to increase the safety of blood products and by constant work in this area over the coming years, we have regained the public's confidence," Hema-Québek said, proudly adding that almost 94% of the Québek population had already trusted in early 2008.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
"At that time we saw many cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the basic recommendations of Krhter and Gélineau's report, according to which, if we do not know and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures must be taken.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the principle of prudence."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique was found on the market to detect the HIV virus: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that directly reveal the presence of the virus itself in donor blood, and not the presence of antibodies based on tests previously used.
The NAT tests have enabled the deaf period to be shortened between the moment of the patient’s infection and the moment when our techniques in the blood may reveal the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood is now exposed to one out of 12 million people.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone gets HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through blood products to occur.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary for recovery," says Hema-Québek, head of management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of disease element can appear in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like West Nile, is transmitted to blood by insect stings.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," Dr. Décary continues, stressing that, in addition to the safe supply, Hema-Québec must also count on sufficient supplies.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment for cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% of Québečans allowed to donate."
Any healthy person at least 18 years of age, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that's six times a year.
On average, 14% of blood - supplyers are not accepted because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud fevers are rampant, they are excluded for one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, donors’ networks need to be supplemented in proportion to their ageing and no longer able to donate blood.
However, it is difficult to persuade people to give blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to give blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québek, who also manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, is flowing with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood samples from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we expect to collect over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL division yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and crucial round of the quarter-finals played on the total number of goals, thanks to the victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders from Seattle.
Backer Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a two-way goalless first half, the backup team David Testo and Rocco Plancentino set up the remaining two goals of the montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Let us remind you that on Friday during the first of the two quarterfinals, the Impact in Starfire Complex in Tukwila in the suburbs of Seattle suffered defeat 2:1.
The impact will measure its forces in the semifinals with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled the 3-1 deficit in the home game and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps advanced to the semifinal round with a total score of 5:4.
The impact should meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovaleva's winning goal
The first attack trio of Canadien is ready to begin the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekance and Andrei Kosticin last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev reaped one pass in this fourth win of three-colored out of six preparatory games.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need one more fight to make me feel good."
"In the first period he tried to handle too much," remarked Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice round of applause."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party Congress (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's supplemental elections.
"Delegating the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the conclusion of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were shown behind his back in a kind of image grinder.
On three giant canvases ran a loop with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, like in the election period.
After all, at the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that it would trigger early elections in the autumn, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
"Plan North" is the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, the vision of the "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on the labour force, an agreement between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - North Territories on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "damage with great potential", but it did not mention the term, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: in particular hydropower plants, forests, but mainly the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice the size of France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he emphasized, as if he wanted to show that he was appealing to a national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, highlighted the Prime Minister: the gold hunt in Abitibi, Québecian engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after the theatrical silence, to look at a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, specified the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all the governments to date.
There is one border line that no longer exists for a long time, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, I will retake this position in the name of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "there is also a need to rethink our vision of the North in relation to climate change," he said when talking about the North-West transition, which will open year-round due to the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the land, the native nations, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Québec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young ones.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about 30 communities.
The interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, 'not necessarily a summit', but a moment when 'a common vision will be set up'.
The development of the North should, moreover, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a continuous follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Just like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Such was, after all, one of the ever-shattered topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage joining the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted suggests that Beauharnois' headquarters be christened to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out a calm revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to Bourass, who created James' Bay, our party managed to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, the Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric plant, Charest emphasized that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his member base, giving a lot of applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering elections in the autumn of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his program was full, especially by the Federal Council missions in China and by the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend convention provided a platform for the chief of liberals for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "efforts to amend the Constitution", which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) requires particularly recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint part of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council who would have the right of veto in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was sceptically adopted in its main features.
Head of PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois relaunched the North Quebec Development Policy launched by Landry’s government in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck to it, "we would have moved on today", Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections take place today) François Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"But we wish it was not just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" in Harper's cabinet, who took the liberty of saying about Louise Arboure last summer that he was a disgrace to Canada.
In this way, to disgrace a woman who has led a relentless fight for justice, and who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not brought back to its homeland a national locked up in Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even consider that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at a time when the actions he was accused of were about to take place.
The only government that, even though Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and rots in inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty international and in particular the Association of Canadian Lawyers defend Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can look forward to a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little does it care that this young man is psychologically destroyed next time, and this is undoubtedly permanent, after so many years of torment.
We don't realize this, but we're witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our "democracy", the words Harper's so flaunting and sounding so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, imprison him according to the will of the head of the so far minority government (as it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the Party that proclaims Virtue, the Law, and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made up the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this waiver, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwell discourses
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has begun to prosecute three authors and a poor little publishing house for libel in order to spark a "transparent public debate" and demand six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for libel, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver's major resolution is completely over.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate to bring anyone who dares defend the opposite position to ruin it?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and to fight a very unbalanced battle with an army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of mining company.
After all, the tactics in these unbalanced battles often consist in bankrupting the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that closes the mouth of the counterparty and, moreover, frightens anyone who dares to pursue this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of the matter to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, Canada normally has a debate in exchange for ideas rather than a baton.
Thus, the mining company was not enough to open its books, its documentation, and a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the matter.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion, and smurf rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a 'public debate' and at the same time despise the opinion of the same public?
In the vice president's world, that word seems to refer to only fat-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrow concept.
In a democracy, they have the right to speak, even the narrators.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because he rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to hear and judge Barrick, but based on a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many see as prosecution, in which the defendant should be blocked (in the context of his prosecution of the "public debate", Barrick has, by the way, just filed an official invitation to Noir Canada's authors to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
Apart from the surreal speech of Garver, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of exploration and the search for truth that is essential for every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to citation of credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that are itself the basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without exposing ourselves to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be created by following the scientific standards used by Noir Canada’s authors.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he has no intention of having a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would limit such a type of wrongful prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the biggest bailout economic plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, using $700 billion to slow the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms ensuring the payment of public money deposited, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to non-payment, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis currently taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption of American daily life will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last hours, negotiations have started at the maximum speed of fear of the effect that another failure would have on investors’ mood.
The time limit was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to negotiate later and both expressed themselves rather in favour of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added to the agreement some measures, in particular the aim of enabling owners to maintain their residence, and the wage of the heads of the state-saved companies.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take special measures for some people's irresponsibility, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked by another station to vote in favour of the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I've read, [shows] that it's something that we'll all have to spend and that we can move on with.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700-billion-dollar plan is to buy doubtful claims and risk and unsaleable assets from US financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by the bursting bubble in the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the decomposition of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of last week's first draft agreement was caused by Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats agreed that the government would only guarantee some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty, but not buy them, there is a belief that the impasse is averted.
In an effort to bring the conflicting views closer together in Congress, a measure was added that the government would be able to introduce new charges to help it regain its contribution if, as a result of the programme, it had to take over losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add an additional 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in saved companies, which, in the event of profits, will pay him dividends and which he will be able to sell again when this is over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the property seizure procedures related to the loans to which the plan relates, as well as to set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The planners of the plan would like to put him to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project in both Republican and democratic camps.
"It is quite obvious that Washington can't hear you," declared Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's financial committee, to the electorate.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, profiting on taxpayers is not the answer."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed "the Skeptic Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"The four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too quickly and carefully examine which path to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the emergency meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from buying its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of a crisis of risk loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said the Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
This is what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times."
On the other side of the Channel, so far, the British government seems to have launched the nationalisation of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75,5 billion) constituted loans to buy real estate.
According to yesterday's announcement, the Spanish bank Santander will buy out the branches and accounts of British bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has had to nationalize since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes for a long time represented his trump, according to others a weakness.
Did this American actor break out of narcissism with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
The shyness, tenderness, and unfailing talents that were his own also distanced him from the power category that begets true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the bold years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, who had been like him for a long time as his rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, surely more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without an exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country in love with a self made man, a fighter in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then visited New York Actor's Studio and celebrated the triumph in the theater, on TV and soon in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer, who was second in the 24-hour Le Mans race in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, despite the fact that since 1958 he was a model couple with Joanne Woodward.
With him also leave the shady places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused dizziness to film lovers, while his great roles compete on the black screen of memories.
After him, he defiles more than half a century of constantly transforming American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) emerges in memory again, a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on the Hot Roof, the adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From a less ancient past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled by an advanced marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a battered, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In Sign of Hate) Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken over after his death, which Newman made in 1956.
Sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Bitter and vindictive pool player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character as The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, bringing him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling for ages, it was him.
And him again.
In his career, different eras compete.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He then concluded his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which had left the craft quite soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its gilds, pompousness and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, a "living challenge underplaying", judging that in his performances he pushed too hard on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom roles came as on a platter, the profession was not always so tender.
The first lovers, however, played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate ones, whose decline and rebellion reflected in his perfect features.
As director of Newman, he revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the lead, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness, dedicated to his son Scott, who was lost because of an overdose.
In the rush of honors that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former fellow soldier Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented: "His presence made my life and this country better."
The grandeur, the love of life, are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great civil rights fighter, ecology, an independent film, opposer of Hollywood's decline, is also leaving.
His likeness we used to see on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed rather tasteless to us, although it was initially a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Hard Childhood.
In this way, Newman, rather than being lulled by glory, had been engaged in society until the very last moment.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to watch the career of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, October 8th, the trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Among other crimes, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed in the long term and systematically by a criminal organisation, which has caused extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often supported the fulfilment of their tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and self-government - totalling approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The way he also informed the investigating authority was that the money received in the tender was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual consideration, and the undertakings accepted never complied with.
According to the prosecution, a lot of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Yozsefross market, and round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of which companies should produce invoices were decided, among other things, on a tour along the northern bank of Balaton, to which István Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was supposed to look up the first boarding houses and restaurants.
In them he asked for bills for his consumption, according to which model were then produced invoices submitted in the framework of public competitions, including the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Self-government of the Capital.
Most of the invoices were exhibited by István Lados with his associate András
On his "study trip", Lados looked up a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering establishment provided catering for a 90-member group of Biztos Pont.
However, according to the company manager, so many people would not suddenly fit into this facility.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 was swarmed with formal and content errors to the foundation Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Éveredért.
The pension in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet there were 130 guests on the invoice.
However, the fuller of forms with a rich imagination overtook it even when they mentioned the documents of the company devoted to hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts according to the information provided to the prosecutor's office documents in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even figure.
The head of the company Győző Farkas pro hvg.hu said that when he was called to the D.A. and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that they were false documents.
"Our company's name and our tax number were stamped in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, it was not agreed that they had accommodated a hundred people according to the invoice, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, there was also food on the invoice, with their restaurant no longer working for a long time.
Zealous invoice manufacturers have also not convinced themselves that the Budapest Travel Agency only organises foreign travels and the invoice with cash payment, which also did not match the company’s billing practice, has foolishly stated as a travel brokerage service in Hungary.
Moreover, as has been established during the investigation, they also indicated VAT in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On four documents issued by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o., the company disagreed, among other things, with the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the 25 % but by the 15 % VAT, in addition only by the employees of the hotel issued printed invoices, but the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "publishers" ruined the invoice, for example, by stating with one company how the state prosecutor's investigation revealed that the road transport of goods, which was not originally carried out at investment consultancy, was carried out.
The fact that invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the association XXI. Szazadi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have also been falsified because of formal deviations - not corresponding to the format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time of 2001 when a group from the Fiatal Városért Association was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he would publish the paper.
The invoices were exhibited knowingly
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for around four million forints for the Harmadik Éveredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták organization.
According to the prosecution, Collab s.r.o., the head of Collab s.r.o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
The company Biogate s. r. o also cooperated with Zuschlage and its associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied Jobb Jövőért and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth around five million forints, for which there was no actual economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of billing companies include those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not available.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were bought by Cash Investment s. r. o., which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
In 2002-2005, a man from Romania was to hand over documents relating to the company also to Iván Kubatov.
As we know, during the investigation Kubatov admitted that on behalf of the company he had issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and accepted their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian bricklayers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get a job.
However, the companies benefited him because, at the request of the co-incriminated lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Atlasz and Y-Generatió associations linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The D.A. concluded that Kubatov had come to 10 percent of the amounts shown on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time to tender for the company Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generatió and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszágért associations submitted proposals for the public competition of the Mihálye Tancsics Foundation (TMA), a public-service organization of the Socialist Party.
They obtained after 500 thousand forints, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To make this clear, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a home search at the office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, a part of the defendants will probably describe the process of production of invoices, as they have already done in the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has already promised several times that he will interpret everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying much of the damage, fifty million forints, with him perhaps the socialists have made a deal and Zusi will take the fall.
Moreover, he could have been offended so far, since his requests to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely, the placing under house arrest, have remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes who have done much more damage than they have yet to pay may freely walk or at least wait for the end of their proceedings in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people don't want to lag behind in the eBay auction competition, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Research, using an experimental auction, tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a staged auction, examining the active areas of the brain of the test subjects using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, the important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to function intensively when losing.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region plays a role in the "self-remuneration" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to researchers, therefore, unscrewing the price can be explained by the effort to avoid the sharp reaction of the striata.
To support their theory, members of the research team from economists conducted a financial cross-cutting investigation.
Three groups litigated against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product and they made bets.
In addition, members of another group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive another $15 reward.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was all about the fact that one was stressed by winning and the other by losing.
However, members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winner" group, which confirms the neurologist hypothesis.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
Up until now, these have explained phenomena observable in auctions to the joys of victory and avoidance of risk.
The neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are treated, which is why sick people often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, typical of liver inflammation and jaundice, but the origins of the disease and diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways, depending on the underlying disease: hepatitis A and E to the digestive tract (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travelers should in any case be protected by vaccination against A and B virus, there is no vaccine against Type C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after ingestion of an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
After this, jaundice is formed on the skin and the whites of the eyes, lightening the stool and darkening the urine. The treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people around the world die of a more serious type of disease, liver cancer, and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that estimates suggest that only one in 10 infected patients are treated medically.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to hepatic cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected do not even know about their disease, causing the disease to destroy the liver cells insidiously, so the first symptoms occur in many cases up to 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important to prevent early, carry out regular depreciation.
In three groups, this disease occurs a lot more frequently than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already show routine laboratory testing, a person should contact his or her physician if he or she notices any signs of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the organism to prevent infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was organised by organizations representing the sick for the first time worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, to the causes of its development and to the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God acts as an analgesic that could ease the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, researching how faith in a god of pain affects man, reported the British daily Telegraph.
As part of a bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all watched the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
The technique of the detailed examination of the human brain also showed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
Research is the first of a series of researches involving scientists, philosophers, and theologians from various parts of the university, alongside academics.
The exact test was carried out by attaching a sparking tool to the left hand of the test subject, which emitted electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe the two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary, dating back to the 17th century, and the Lady with Leonard da Vinci's Edge, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of research hoped that the view of Our Lady would create a certain state of piety for the believers, while Da Vinci chose the picture because they did not differ much from the first one and make a calming impression.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received in four consecutive parts 20 electroshocks, while separately watching the picture with religious or general themes.
Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they had been taken care of and "calmed down, filled them with peace".
In observing a religious picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by means of any powerful image even in atheists, just to find the right photograph.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of his research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they showed them some Madonna by Leonard or a painter of similar caliber.
Would the view of the quality of Our Lady mean achieving even better results?

On their tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics paralleling Orwell's dark vision are concerned, the very essence of site 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google founders to stick to their original intention, which was, "Let's get all the information in the world!"
According to Google’s confessed representative, even after ten years of worldwide work, the company is only at the beginning of working with all the information.
On the question, what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like, "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would I actually use?" - but such seemingly simple questions will not be able to answer software until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know very well that search words are captured during the internet search, as well as what IP address they were looking for and what pages they moved to after the search.
Thanks to Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, retain the history of their surfing, look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, making it possible to generate findings adapted to them in the long term - the same logic will also be based on Recommendations, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously mentioned and maintained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - the users who are afraid of Google data monopoly are asking.
In most cases, the scope of potential power represented by the company is more threatening, counter-reaction does not create awareness of guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom or even rebellion against power in Internet users.
However, it is confirmed that all search terms are not only captured, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases personal rights of internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous recent example was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that enabled the identification of the pedophiles from the Orkut community sites, established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personal rights could still rest in May when the company, hand in hand with the Electronic Rights Organization, has successfully proved its truth in the dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought for nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained with reference to strengthening the law adopted years ago on child protection, but still failed to get lists of search items of individual users, or full lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the provision of their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be exposed to Google services, and they act against it with revolt, such as multinational companies with conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around with enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big companies, "the corporation that's running", unlike its rival Microsoft, considered to be the conqueror of the world because of Windows, no matter how much they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, more youthful, "cooler" than the practice of an official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which brought with it just one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
The web 2.0 is nothing more than about cooperation, that we deliberately leave clues behind and use the communication channels available to us, and although their range is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which record music that he listens to, all of which can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides, he can write a blog on which his latest photogallery, which he stores on Flickr or Picase, will automatically appear.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which it is clear: a girlfriend in the morning when looking at a flood of pictures of her mutual friends can easily figure out who her bewitching boyfriend was spending the evening with, or the company can fire its employee just because on its blog she describes her sincere opinion of the top management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely re-evaluated today.
The person who lives online is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (begins by Scroogle, who uses Google's search system, but does not deliberately leave traces).
For example, a small number of people do not deliberately register on community sites to be found. Online Google applications from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not create the best possible profile.
Public opinion does not very secretly expect Google to show teeth.
With its present value of $156 billion worth, Intel ($140 billion), Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertisers threaten investment by advertising agencies, and services introduced at an ever-rapid pace seriously make life more uncomfortable not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software designers.
In addition, critical observers find counterpoints that have a disturbing impression: for example, the senior management has completely rejected employee protests after raising twice the fee for the company’s kindergarten, any frequent daily diet of employees was too expensive, according to the company’s management, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google still bowed before the Chinese government in 2006 and in the sense of their agreement, it will filter out any finding that contradicts good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company’s internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be distorted by the world in new places: while some believe that Google’s project for scanning and archiving books and magazines takes on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous Cory Doctorow novel "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminisces a future in which you can get close to a person with only Google data.
The double killer from Ozad helped remove the tracks of two juveniles
Two minors were questioned by the police in the case of a double murder in Ozda, which, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to remove traces of this crime, said the spokesperson of the Chief Police Directorate of Borsod County on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activities of which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding the offence.
Both juveniles, according to MTI's information, two girls are being prosecuted at large.
Aiding a crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozda, a 23-year-old male here, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a felony premeditated multiple homicides for self-interest reasons.
During the investigation, it became clear that a 23 - year - old man owed a 53 - year - old man a greater amount.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a facility in Ozda last Wednesday, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man prepared himself to commit the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder by a weapon hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a hundred percent package of Prague Stock Exchange shares.
Ludwig Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange Czechs had already excluded the Prague Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the State.
99 % of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell 60 % of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börs have so far submitted an offer.
Last week, the head of Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 % of the shares could be sold out.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25% share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European leaves
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading newspaper recalls the "second September 11th".
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the US President, accuses Roman La Repubblica. The President was not even able to sew his own party to support that fast-paced bill, which aims to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which resembled billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about September 2nd.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo, the world economy was brought to the brink of collapse by a lack of political leadership there.
The danger of the US financial system’s collapse is constantly increasing, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Although the Bush plan was not perfect, after the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - right at the moment when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw a life-cycle into winding money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from failure.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither money nor improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to get over their national egoism and unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the stagnant monetary institutions received more than 100 billion euros, recalling the Vienna Der Standard, which says that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets in order to resolve the crisis, increasingly real.
The European Union has not yet seriously dealt with the crisis that, as a tsunami, is rolling through the old continent.
"Salvators" may not immediately wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if they determined where it is reasonable to go for taxpayers' money to avoid even greater harm.
Smart car imitates bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
Bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the Japanese trade fair CEATEC, was inspired by engineers from Nissan bumblebees. It was about how to build a new generation of systems preventing collisions.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan designed a biomimetic robotic control system of BR23C type, a robotized minicar equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our protective packaging," he explained at Kazuhiro Doi exhibition, the CEO of the brand for technological PR and research and development.
Composite eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions of view.
Engineers reached the idea of the laser distance meter to copy the function of the composite eye.
It identifies the obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters in front of the BR23C in the 180-degree field of vision, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotized car starts imitating the movements of the bee and turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver is taking place in an entirely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, a robotic car would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective packaging within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not last longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, an instinctive, intelligent response, not a processing ability, is important, the less data storage.
This mechanism must only process and respond to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and respond using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, therefore he constantly uses only memory of the size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with a giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing an immediate avoidance technology that, according to Nissan's estimate, could reach serial-produced vehicles within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified final destination after avoiding obstacles.
Damn dear child already has a name
The $700 billion economic bailout bill, which is to be divided into several instalments and which aims to buy off poor bank loans, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight of American Eastern time, Congressional officials reached an agreement in a few days’ debate on a $700 billion bailout, Reuters said.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the House of Representatives, according to which only the drafting of the agreement remains.
Both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the compromise on the package.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and it will be effective, but further action needs to be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. in Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft legal standard, which will be heard in the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, which is to be established by the Programme, and then it will be the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then the news of the agreement was also welcomed at the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made last night and appreciate both sides' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said spokesperson Tony Fratto.
After all, the program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which was intended to ensure that a total of $700 billion was spent on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of $700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after Congress is expected to decide on the matter on Monday, and the Treasury will buy mortgage-backed securities, which are rated as unquality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special congregation, the chairman of which will also be a member of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the other half of $700 billion will depend on Congress's next decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined policy within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy off low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "poisoned" loans.
The purchase may take place within auctions directly, and the competent representatives of the Ministry have informed them.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance grants them guarantees for a means of providing cause for concern, for which the company will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, whether it is a large purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the large money institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank bosses who are in trouble waiting to help the state can count on the government to cut their severance pay - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
Only in certain cases will they be reduced, and these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax mark will be imposed on the gold parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of a direct buy-back of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that money is not excessive for management.
It must be added that the already existing gold-falling contracts will not change, the restriction concerns only new ones, which is intended to further stimulate participation in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history to have legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs in force," commented Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
Moreover, the state in the banks participating in the programme will be entitled to a share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the rescued bank are on their feet, they can also make a profit from the transaction.
The proposal contains that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
Of course, there have also been voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this does not protect taxpayers' dollars," said the Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that the adoption of the provisions was urged by exactly those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, then by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1,1 percent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent year-on-year.
Production prices in the industry were 0.7 percent higher as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, rising by 3.2 percent year on year.

Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industry also increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in the luggage and saddlery products sector by 4.6 percent, respectively, footwear production by 2.5 percent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials and products sector (1.6 percent).
Prices decreased in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other manufacturing sectors, we measured price increases in the range 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which has a large weight in the domestic sales of the industry, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly by the continued effect of the officially established increase in gas prices since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in each processing industry, prices increased most in the oil processing industry (32.4 percent).
In the manufacturing sector, 13,2 % could be observed, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products with a decisive weight, then 11 % price increase.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile industries (2.5 percent) and electrical machinery (0.3 percent).
In other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6% and 9.1%.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry increased by 10.2 percent during the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water industries exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
From the point of view of the sector's focus, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the material asset sector was shown on domestic sales in August.
In consumer goods industries, prices increased by 0.3 percent, in energy processing and further processing sectors, prices did not change in relation to the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increase in respect of the same month of the previous year was observed in energy from processing and further processing sectors (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods sector, we measured an increase in prices of 6.8 percent, while in the case of tangible assets, prices fell by 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, with a decrease of 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
In one month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent relative to the euro, then by 7.1 percent relative to the dollar, increased by 7.5 percent relative to the euro compared to August 2007 and by 15.9 percent relative to the dollar.
Next year, to the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force around 12 January, and the Secretary of State spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "almost everything matters now if an electronic system for the authorisation of travels and inspections is built over the sea in time".
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include permission to enter, but tourists will have to register before they leave.
As of today, the representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington.
She will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order for Merit about the Republic of Hungary and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to the presidential candidate Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, have consistently assured the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but they are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a few days of the meeting of Congress and administration officials, an early announcement was made on Sunday morning: a basic agreement on the bank bailout package was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to reshape the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are consistently referred to as a more suitable candidate to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, along with how economic issues came to the fore, Obama regained some advantage and McCain’s lead disappeared, which secured Sarah Palin’s nomination for Vice President after the Republican Convention.
Obama expressed on Sunday at the Detroit election meeting the hope that the 700 billion package bill would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages concerning consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) to your places, your savings, the entire industry, stability of the entire economy is in danger," he said in front of the 35 000 crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain, in an interview provided by ABC, explained: "It's all going to be a bit abhorrent (...) but doing nothing is simply not a way."
As the Republican Senator said, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission to oversee the Minister of Finance and the severance pay restrictions for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama declared to CBS that McCain did not have a more significant role in the negotiations, he himself was in daily contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill on Monday.
Print Overview of the German Language Region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more confident - so it analyses the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the Red and Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers".
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over its office.
For decades, Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria - and it is these modern citizens that are now turning away from it.
The alternation of the period is a problem for all of Christian democracy, and thus for Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not entirely surprising for CSU, but on Saturday the trial ended, which could be expected for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005, i.e. in the so often mentioned Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernisation that CSU has consistently carried out in this country, which eats its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the pace. Secularization, education results, settlement of Germans from the East and from the North in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequences on CSU voters' loyalty.
Modernization is linked to the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political implications.
Right-wing camp is intact, only voters inside became more confident, more critical, more headstrong.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, CSU has been the most distant from the classic civil classes; free professions, tradesmen, graduates and university education.
By this, CSU’s support has shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who, with whom? The chairmen of the parties are being held back on the issues of the coalition", the conservative Viennese daily deals with the confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the interference of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate on the coalition.
The elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders did not get much insight into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in social partnerships it exists.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, Schüssel-Molterer's course was outvoted at every turn.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red bids.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed definitely within ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider once again appeared open to all directions.
"To prevent the Red and Black Coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóková: It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Equality Summit, hosted by France this year, was launched by the current President of the State of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the professional debate in her message addressed to plenary, turned her attention to segregation in education, as she is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their application.
On behalf of the French Presidency, Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference.
They sat among invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civic associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs of the Fidesz Járóková movement, she pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that takes place in recruitment, Romani people are being pushed out of the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education."
Járóková also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to confirm the knowledge of these contexts in the broadest circles - between Romani and non-Romani children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties they contribute to the national budget.
"The right of the European Union's citizenship to Romani people is the need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their low quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, the European Union's cohesion is needed, with emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, in order to accelerate the desegregation processes of schools immediately, this is of paramount importance to correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken; Romani children must be given the opportunities given to democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková demanded.
Everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, organised annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination set out at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the serving duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the disgraceful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has been adjourned by the Bavarian CSU so far.
Chairman of the Erwin Huber party and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may remain in their seats, the question is, when will this pardon last?
The fate of Tandem, who suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of vote, will be decided by the party’s last weekend in October.
In any case, members of a highly criticized duo have been told that they will not cling to their posts with all their strength.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Favour tsunami" to derive personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, still under Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the top of his career - gained the Christian Social Union 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but it was only able to achieve 43.4 percent.
CSU has been in Bavaria producing 18 percent of German GDP "self-governor" for 46 years.
Although conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to have a high position, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first features of the reorganisation within the party is the fact that the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber, will be a member of a narrow intelligence team, which will begin the sounding negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the Liberal FDP, or with a right-wing group of Free Voters.
Ironically, Gabriele Pauli, on the candidate for the Free Voter, used the Huber-Beckstein duo to perform the coup, but then took a mercilessly short trial with an ambitious local politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, Stoiber, who has been spinning strings from behind so far, will also play an active role, the former Prime Minister of the country and the former president of the CSU called the most bitter day of his political career on September 28.
On Monday Huber made some snarky remarks about the CDU, according to him they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag on September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless CSU, which played a significant role in the national success of 2005, somehow gets back on its feet together.
According to Merkel, who had difficulty hiding her disappointment because of the fiasco, CSU’s loss of positions would not have a negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
This is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU, and the social democrat crisis will continue.
The SPD has achieved 18.6 percent of the weakest result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
In the Sunday elections, not a single opposition MP made it to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the well-being and stability of the country run by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the illegalities that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million-dollar country has lacked opposition well for ten years, the opposition, combined under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections, was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who, following the amendment of the constitution in the 2006 elections, had had his presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time, would allow several opposition Members to appear in Parliament.
The ODS thus dropped even the previously considered boycott.
In the background of opposition expectations, it was that Belarus was economically increasingly dependent on Russia - which wished to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment rated as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians were not given entry permits - to mitigate the impact of the ever-expensive Russian gas import.
The release earlier pointed out that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, had placed emphasis on positive shifts and not on shortcomings - such as a ban on candidacy for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE Monday’s flash report already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were basically unable to appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present with the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow and with smaller confrontations, while refusing to recognise the detached South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has considered these two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable for it to remain that way, even though "she was too afraid to go into a meaningless parliament of the only member of the opposition".
Looking at the results of the opposition, he is not planning protest actions, rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, because we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, but the local authorities are hindering distribution, but I see that more and more people are supporting change, even among the older ones," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider the right or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security of the 'inducing silence of the cemetery' collapses," says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian observers considered elections democratic.
The Head of Mission of the Community of Independent States Sergei Lebedev told the Russian intelligence agency Ria Novita that "people do not believe words, but deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
This is the first time in Chigi Palace history that a revolving door was introduced on the arrival and departure of employees.
From now on, however, this new measure will begin to work against the cunning, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee at work time.
The news against sloths was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the President's Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving door - says Brunetta – is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services", explains the Minister.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will open.
It is reformism", emphasises Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete its implementation in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "This was a joint procedure with the staff and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister will eventually announce that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more people per year at work".
And it will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"Its payout dynamics – explained by the Minister – have doubled in the last 8-10 years in relation to the private sector and are much higher than the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees have gathered to reject the Brunett Decree standards in accordance with the Codacons-backed application.
"While the Minister for Public Administration today presents figures on the lower absence of work due to illness – writes the consumer protection association – the nation of 'hard lazy people' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public administration employees gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree".
Taru will be protested, in particular, against the exclusion of the sick pay, which depends on the activity; the extension of the period in which the sick person can be checked, in which time checks will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Resolut prevention"
Every day, 2,500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die, and 27 people remain permanently disabled.
The Inail values confirm that for 2007, we have roughly 1,200 deaths due to accidents at work.
These values show the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly twice the deaths compared to murders.
In order to re-invigorate the attention of institutions, social and informational means regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Accidents in all Italian regions on the second Sunday of October.
"The alarming data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of work safety", confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for Mutilated and Disability for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his vivid admiration for the constant joint effort to protect the injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion."
"Of course, outraged 'enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies, which, by their scope, create a stir in the media and public opinion, but everyday reality offers us once again dramatic cases, even recurring in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that 'there is undoubtedly a problem of resources here: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Many initiatives put forward in the field of education are of particular importance so that young people facing the world of work become more aware.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber, on his part, stressed "as the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, as it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make convincing efforts towards the necessary termination of this state."
"As regards the data of accidents at work, they seem to show a positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from accidents at work is alarming anyway," said President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't exactly want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because right when the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that in general there is still little to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - that Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training workers, right from the school age'.
"An additional effort is needed - he added - in terms of communication and public opinion participation.
But the main thing is to have a greater sense of responsibility from employers to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli finally stated that this is a progressive degeneration of the levels of the right to compensation foreseen for the work victims and "delegation of support care" to which the system has been receiving in recent years."
"The aim is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifts from time to time by the legislator".
Mp3 players charged, putting their hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music instruments as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a report published today by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) Eu, in an official report published in Brussels.
"From this scientific point of view – we read in notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years with portable musical instruments, weekly more than an hour a day, and keep the instrument at high volume, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who use often portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way", admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – the lead – show a clear risk and need to respond quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine the already existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them fully effective and to keep up with the new technology".
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists – closed down the executive official Eu – confirm the need to worry, and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties that raised the problem, what measures could possibly be introduced and thus better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, which is caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices".
At present, there is a safety European standard that limits the level of noise of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise are increasing.
It is possible to reduce these damage greatly by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, will exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices, and their quantities can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission take its course for the future of the capital
We'll start today, close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidoglie to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital City of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will draw up a manual for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and its councilman Gianni Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to highlight Alemanno – It will have to ensure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political arbitrators, which remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
This is not about any exchange of functions, but just about trying to have some place to process a great project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March, and then it will dissolve, because this institution must have an exact deadline.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
Whoever accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: "It is all about the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Attali Commission proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics will break away from everyday problems and from time to time the urgency will occur.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to stress that 'this Commission is neither a useless enterprise nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, it will not cost neither the euro for Roman citizens and it will serve to reflect on and involve the best intelligence the capital has'.
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobilized, in order to allow our city to have an authentic rise at the level it necessarily needs, and to think with a united spirit of its future."
The future, which specifies the mayor of Rome 'will not only be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further' not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status the capital, but 'will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean'.
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam".
The attacks against Obama are growing just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami posted on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama has the nerve: he thinks he will get to the highest position of the nation, who had all of it two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then we have surveys; everyone says that Obama will win and with a big head start.
Even in this case, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, the bowels of the South of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling booth, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
One aspect of American mentality remains sociable until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to check, Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
1500 people asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty - nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became a weakness for most of Bush.
Who will take the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The US economic collapse was also felt by journalists: there is an investigation period in the newspaper, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the status of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, now almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say that they had less to worry about credibility.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to.
Money, the money, is the problem for American journalists.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the paper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists asked, this is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists of press and executive seniors believe that journalism is taking the wrong path on a national scale.
There's an executive group in the local area at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many view as "killer" printed matter.
"Economic pressure", to which journalists point out, increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists interviewed admitted to resorting to technology in the hope of "doing something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is among those who manage newsrooms – that is, leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "work security" for someone.
Leaders who think they're going to lose their jobs in three years are 47% at national level.
As far as the press is concerned, they're at 30%.
As far as "sure work" is concerned with staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on a daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a vast nation as Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and Internet employers often offer what they want, so the question is to take or leave.
Managers receive almost always huge salaries, and the editor can earn $10,000 a month out of pension and insurance payments.
As far as vacations are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: TRIAL IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYING IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the submission of an entrepreneur with the realities of Daniel Coppola, who has asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the counteroffer for the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he received a home arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that a real estate entrepreneur be able to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (as opposed to which he expressed himself) would allow him to influence his society and get to the evidence that blames him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon was manifested a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan submitted to the White House: a large proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis divides the Republican party, increasingly divided among its old soul East Coast, milder, accommodating to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to the "D.C." and the world of finance, particularly in the Central and South states.
A soul that was arrogantly manifested by the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
But this very thing is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but all over the West, and perhaps not just here.
In both Usa and Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubating for a long time, which are strengthening and finally coming to light in the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category State-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis in the banking sector of financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country are included, in a single state.
This has also created a political problem for those who run it: this means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families who are voters, among other things.
In short, the crisis seems economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political inter-ethnicism seems to be substantially out of the loop or that it has little to add: obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and various state strategies and which cannot decide on one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the recovery of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: when we get into trouble, only the states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to fix everything.
And they also have the necessary means and authority to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, in which no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have such a level.
After all, this new emphase, which the crisis puts on a national element, is in complete harmony with the ever-increasing importance of which the latest economic advances are trying to attribute to one factor closely linked to it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom of Sita, increasingly sophisticated technology, and material, while we were convinced that global finances were already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little material things as water, grain, oil.
All things that would have said could be transported from one place to another on earth, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the bounded area, the territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up his sleeve than who isn't and who has the misfortune of living in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it predicts a turning point.
Who speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, i.e. leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, awareness that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can take on the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leaders, especially economic ones, which proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredit, impatience, incompetence and absence, which is trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that they are becoming increasingly widespread in the vast masses of the population of belief, rather than their actions being the same as the ideas of the so far popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from underground, but a strong movement to eliminate ruling classes and traditional political order is reflected in the sudden electoral "refoulements" or in unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of Labourists in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also has to do with it).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have more and more problems understanding, i.e. representing, which, not from now on, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially too shabby.
Before this, it would be excessive to talk about a permanent "mass revolt".
But I'm sure we can't say that it means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue for walking on walls
Beat the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a stoligram body glued to a vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing, which use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
«The basis of glue can be seen as a series of pipes laid as an arranged pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to provide a perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "it simply sticks away from the wall» explains Liming Dai, researcher at Dayton University Engineering School.
"This material could be useful as makeshift glue" will deliver Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers think of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aeronautical space engineering .
No super heroes for now.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also involved in researching new glue.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented microfiber - shaped glue as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving to the surface to maintain perfect tightness.
Medications: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed mainly in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the increase or decrease in efficacy with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, to highlight the risks of juices both ready and fresh in combination with the ingestion of some drugs, at the current 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new alarm: just one glass of grapefruit, orange, and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects and expose patients to risk health.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to the toxic level the effects of certain anti-arithmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
The Italian Medical Agency itself announced it in the newsletter two years ago and encouraged doctors and patients not to underestimate the risks arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medication, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
Long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
From there Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually immediately announced to various international and national pharmacies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative list of medicines you receive and if you encounter anything unclear, do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» stressed an expert for Ansa.
Nobel for the Economics of Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in foreign, economic and political actions of the Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, on the days of Enron’s collapse, Krugman predicted in a comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be much more important than the first, in terms of the consequences of the United States’ history.
A prediction that caused a few polemics and which had been reproached for years, but which proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at the speed at which the collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Central European Bank Executive Committee, Krugman is a "economics of great importance", but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, especially critical of Bush's liberalist administration's excesses".
Open Office, we have a third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production, which aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work by volunteer workers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows up to the general public with various new features: welcome screen and revised and improved opening window will be added to the latest standard version of ISO.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperating with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft file extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Special features of some models are interesting, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF folder to the graphic design model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have spreadsheet processor or text program properties.
Cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in excellence it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each coworker is assigned one colour to comment to make a clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should reshape the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, which has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for Linux operating system.
Installation cd can also be sent home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the theme of freeness can be a draw to expand in households, it is the business area that the Open Office package has a lot of stakes, and it can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is also an offer of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, in the end, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the release of a new version it is possible that this number can be overcome.
Also Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and top-class T-shirt winner.
The report was quoted by L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor positive for Cero, Epo third generation, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, even him from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those carried out in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positivity of Ceru, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positive third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed the results of the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Saster and American Cadel Evans, and he also won a dot T-shirt of the best climber.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES IS ITALIA RASIST?
Italy 'as a country of emigrants only in the last house has transformed into a priority target of immigrants' adopted with opposition.
Does it turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is how they ask in a long article in the New York Times, which devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month because he stole a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times define as "the paradox of the north": the northern regions are also those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support for the North League".
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the Lega, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinala, asked the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the union for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that the entire class of students has lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear – explains the head of the Sunia studios, Laura Mariani – in this city, the large demand from the students has distorted the market in such a way that it has stimulated the process of rising prices, which has spread to residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offenses: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, associated with subleases.
Sunja needs an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices through the revision of taxes.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for about 450 euros per bed, a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (bande Nere zone) to a mean value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, there is a need for 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in double bed.
Values are slightly lower (550 euro per single) in zones near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples there is a bed of 300/450 euros, a room of 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want EUR 250/35 per bed, at least 350 per single room.
Prices are definitely lower in smaller cities, but they have a greater impact on the citizens' economy.
In cities like Perugia, where rent is the most common phenomenon for students from outside the European Union, there is finally another anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students compared to Italian students.
Good-bye to the old Paradise cinema, cities cancel historical halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is as blind as a face without eyes."
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multisals in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of genuine cultural crime.
Historical places often disappear filled with memories," it is as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a journey and a lot of emotions», feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Tornator Oscar and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes 20 years ago, and who told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness about the way the cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 cinemas of the traditional tip closed, and the highest account was paid mainly by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torino, 5 less in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna, with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41), is the first priority among the regions most affected by closures.
And proof that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the onset of multiplex, these three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinema multisals: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romana.
«The Italian procedure has evolved irrationally» claims Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive because when one cinema closes in the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let us not talk about the under-subsidisation of the fund in favour of operators: the previous state debt is around 10 million euro.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would take between 16 million and 18 million euros a year to support the sector».
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city, which is concerned about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protokula between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax relief in favour of operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the limited transport zone and will have special prices to stop and at some parking lots.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is more demanding.
Defense of the traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a spark that convinced me to establish the "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before Rialt or Quirinal in Naziionale Street, where I shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at signs blackened with dust, I turn to the other side».
The link between politics and the mob group 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to modify the elections of the City Authority according to the interests of the mafia Piromalli Group".
The charges that the Directorate against the Mafia in Calabria raises against the mayor and Vice Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavon, and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the mafia organization, are difficult.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the lawyer, the boss's nameplate, who was accused of committing crime of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," state prosecutors write, when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay consultations to Piromalli's lawyer.
"They would allow the mafia group – they write to the judges – to officially enter the city authorities and make it easier for them to control and manage the public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal underworlds are a lot in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'ndranghets, heroes who are still undefiled'.
The imprisonment of this morning follows the imprisonment of July last year, by which the police showed that the mafia group Piromalli was given the final hit.
Since the end of April last year, the City Council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, and the reason for that was the supposed connection between organised crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of their office in municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the right-center coalition at the time of the dissolution after the close election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the municipal council to dissolve.
He called to account Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti at the time and accused him of plotting everything for political reasons, but the judges in the prison order signed this morning explain that the mob group had even grown so far that they had asked for a change in the A3 motorway project.
Further interrogations directed against Dal Torrio, written by public prosecutors, revealed "the willingness to move the claims of an entrepreneur, representatives of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromallim and to adapt the elections to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It is an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface and is now being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are the new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of colossals like Chevron, who are now trying to lay hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away, but now environmental organisations and new increases in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London stated in 2007 that approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of waves of the sea.
that amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
Plus there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – a spokesman for a company that is connected to the United States oil colossus, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal – and is thinking about the possibility of working with us".
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to mine oil and President Bush recently came up with a new drilling plan.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so far invested sums, although not known in detail, show increasing interest from observers.
Technology needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology that is still in the early stages, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
So far, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy generation, technologies with a greater impact on the diluent must be used.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are linked to each other.
The power of waves that moves with buoys up and down is changed using cylinders and tops to hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure turns the turbine into the generator.
The energy reaches shore with underwater cables.
So far, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase that are only waiting for federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already generating energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six jet turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water during the tide and tide causes the rotation of the turbines, which feed the generator through this rotating movement.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
At this point, special interest deserves the potential of tides and tides, they say at the Institute for Research on Electricity.
Although this is an incoherent factor, the tides and tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in the energy of the tide and tide that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.50 million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
