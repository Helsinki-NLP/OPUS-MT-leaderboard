Novak helped Trabzonsporu to the second place, Škoda also hit
The defenseman Filip Novák helped with the final round of the Turkish football league Trabzonsporu to the title of vice-master.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayseristor field and kept the third Besiktas behind him.
After the January transfer from Slavia, the attacker Milan Škoda gave the tenth goal for Rigespor, which he saved, even though he succumbed to 1:3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed excellent productivity on the defenseman with a seventh goal in this league year.
In 63. minute the goalie Kayseristor just set off a rough shot and the Czech footballer from an angle hit the ball into the net.
The landlords managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspora in the sixth minute setting pulled the victory to his side when successfully finished the four-on-one break.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce settled after solo to 1:1.
The riskor did not last long, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of his opponents he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition will end in Sunday's duel of the master Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa field.
A well-classified cave near a hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was actually not habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lužické Mountains, not far from Nový Bor in Českolipsko, there are several sandstone rock formations in the forests through which the Count's Way led.
Natural and artificial.
And we're going to follow the human hand created.
The place is called the Hermit's Cave.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here and the caves served as a hiding place, more precisely a hideout chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rocktop and accessible on the stairs from above.
But you can hardly see it until the last moment.
It is revealed by narrow steps leading to a rock gallery from which it is entering the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be far from human dwellings, at the time of its creation there could be a field on the plateau, where there is a forest today.
"The fact that the building does not have a window or even in a traditional location of a heating site clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podružek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone bench in the back, which is probably used to put down the containers.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podružek.
There are traces of tools on the cave walls.
Breaking sandstone with a pointer was quite easy and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to make good use of the claws and gradually break the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the trail of the pointer and the way it is mowing, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the disorder that appears in it, there are sometimes sleepovers there.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are intrigued by a flowing stream under the cave and not far from the count's path, you will surely find the trail down.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be caught by the nearby Raven Rock.
Jockey Minařík is after a heavy fall in Germany in artificial sleep
"Philip is in the best hands right now.
The Institute is set up for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This makes it much easier for me to take care of Finja's daughter," said the server Jezdci.cz, a statement by Minařík's wife Katji.
"Everybody's doing their best, now Philip needs time to recover.
There's no point in giving any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation may change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We must all be patient now and give him time," said the wife of a 45-year-old jockey.
To the financial support of the injured Minarik, the Twitter player Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh race of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday to equalize Lester Piggott's legend.
Almost 70,000 euros have been collected on the Gofundme server today.
The target is EUR 100 000 (CZK 2.6 million).
Videojudge took the footballers Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Although Sassuola’s football players got the ball into the opponent’s goal four times in Saturday’s game in Naples, they eventually had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
Neither of their goals referee after consulting the video because of offsajad did not recognize.
According to the Italian media, this is record bad technology, so many hits VAR has never thwarted one team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no team has ever been.
The new technology breaks records," Gazzetta dello Sport commented.
"Festival of unrecognized Sassuola goals.
VAR has never been so strict with one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday at 8 minutes, but after half an hour of play it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
Filip Djuričič's goal was not recognized after the videojudge's intervention because of the offside.
For the same reason, another Djuričich hit and hits Francesco Caputa and Domenico Berardi were not valid.
On the other hand, the landlord added another goal.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
The most charged in the Czech Republic in history
"The growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging on public stations as well as accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said ČEZ's head of clean technologies Tomáš Chmelík.
Other major players such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla electric car manufacturers, as well as Bill and Lidl supermarkets, report their part on the market.
The operator of classic petrol stations is represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," Jana Jusková explained.
However, Deník's editor exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
They indicate that the drivers took 13,5 kWh on average from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Apart from small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of the refueling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists have already paid for the collection, their typical spending was around 330 CZK.
Electromobility stretches mainly in the capital city.
On the territory of Prague, there are all five of the most busy retaliators of ČEZ, which will be overshadowed by the popularity of the entire regional cities.
Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border, such as Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unusable throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of the year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
Eight percent of readers reported in the extensive "Czech on the Move" Journal that they were considering buying an electric car into the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their vicinity.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to organizers, the government's actions to date on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a stronger approach.
The last drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Movement of Rainbow, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have long-standing anti-expandation in the Turów mine, there are people who are acting against gravel mining near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who are acting against the construction of meaningless dams," Marika Volfová said.
It stated that the main requirements of the protestors were the creation of a plan for water retention in the countryside, a sharp change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies to promote sustainable agriculture, and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend people's interests, not reckless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostranské náměstí there was a stand with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech land and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of Rape Deps" or "Less of Coal, More Mints".
From South Moravia to Prague Jan Škoda came from Za voda for people who protested against the gravel mining plan in Hodonínsk.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140 000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most powerful source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned quarrying of gravel is only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to the reports it is certain that the quality of water will be endangered.
For the so-called agro-ecological farmers came from Valeč village in Karlovy Vary Vojtěch Veselý.
He pointed out the pros of small farms that are not married to income and profit and supply the inhabitants on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, and they will not make such destruction on the form of rural and environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash on a house in Germany.
Three people died today in the fall of an ultralight plane to an apartment building in West Germany and two others were injured.
Local rescue services reported this, according to which there are probably two crew members and one resident of the house among the dead.
The aircraft crashed to the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five housing units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy Chief of Local Fire Department Robert Meyboom has reported that both crew members of the aircraft have probably died.
The third victim, according to the police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The journal Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), referring to Mayor Wesela, wrote that she was a single mother whose two - year - old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a landing brake.
The police assume it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, referring to eyewitnesses, said that before the crash the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft had disintegrated in the air before it hit the ground.
Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been removed
On Saturday afternoon, Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged her clients with some card payments twice.
According to spokesperson Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have been related to thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
The savings bank recorded problems with the double billing of card payments on Saturday afternoon.
"Last night (Saturday) we updated the system and immediately returned all these double payments to clients.
At the moment everything works without problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted the money from card payments twice, the bank’s spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, were smaller than thousands of transactions.
The reasons for the problems of the savings bank are being identified.
"It could have been a combination of more factors," said Kropík.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch will present a three-degree emergency against coronavirus on Monday.
"The levels will be according to the power of community spread at regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told ČT.
It will be a so-called semaphore, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red colour depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would currently have orange colour and Prague would approach it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional health stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level because the situation is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Waterman and Carolina
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Karolínka fall in love with each other, it's not easy at all.
Jonah is in love with his father, the impertinent waterman Hastrbuch, Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonah is not a man.
It's a good thing there's a young man named Libor who's gonna do everything he can to keep the whole village, especially Caroline, safe from the bad guy.
What's the big deal about him scheming and lying?
Especially if she can get Caroline to reject Jonah and prefer him, the valiant Libor.
Soon it will be clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for drowning the late-night Pot, the spoiled flour, the mill fire and other scoundrels.
In addition, the angry villagers will have a water - watering hunt, and an irreconcilable water curse will fall on Jonah’s head.
And now, Pot's little soul, tell Caroline!
How to soften old Hastrubuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech TV studios and in the exteriors of the Brzina pond, in Obděnice na Sedlčany and in the beautiful surroundings of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the majority disease is mild, only three percent of patients have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavir is spreading through the Czech Republic, or our summer dose of sunshine has greatly improved our immunity.
Infectious wards of hospitals are half empty, even if the numbers of the infected grow.
"The situation is completely different today and in April, and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," says Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11th, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, all of them wore masks, the military was taking samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfectant for a year in advance.
Yet ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, maximum two people die.
The highest number of infected per population is still Karvinsko, similar numbers are already in Jihlava due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's Centre, where 57 already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by the hygienist in Černozice in Hradec Králové.
The disease confirmed the tests at one of the nurses.
"We are traveling, we have reduced movement, we have all the sanitary measures," says Martin Schhal, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the home clients have ever had symptoms of disease.
The hygienists will start testing the area tomorrow, and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are responding to an increased number of infections.
Today, the Institute of Oncology in Brno launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people wear a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists who recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them made up of foreign employees of a money company.
Overall, there were 131 infected - i.e. half of Friday's number - but less tested during the weekend.
The debutante champion!
Van den Bergh finished writing a story. Anderson was swept away.
The great surprise of the tournament called Dimitri van den Bergh has performed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player, who won the second most prestigious enterprise within the PDC in 2018.
The beginning of the match was mutually balanced, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh took a 13-arrow leg and he's had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and a much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" was hard to get to.
The way "The Creator of Dreams" had him in his pocket is also evidenced by the fact that the upset Anderson played his first best in the 24th leg.
Moreover, the young Belgian mastered the excellently high checkouts.
Last time he lost in the 11th lego, in an unfavorable state, but "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, there was a huge frustration on Anderson.
The darts were more of a throwaway, and his triumph-walking opponent was acting completely sovereignly.
Van den Bergh turned the first of the three match Darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his great dream.
The profit of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to the Belgian darter that it is his first winning major.
The last player to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Nantes was charged with a cathedral fire, a man confessed
St. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th - century stained windows and destroyed the organ.
Suspects of arson were investigated by investigators because the fire progressed through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police found no sign of anyone entering the cathedral by force at the entrances.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating prosecution.
Now the prosecution has informed that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed, and is facing arson charges.
If he is found guilty, he is facing up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his attorney, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present the "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is supposed to play the role of a pandemic plan that the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism because of its absence.
"The levels will be according to the power of community spread," the Minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the middle, orange stage.
The system is designed as a regional one because the situation in each region differs significantly, added.
The Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be established at individual levels, whether it is an obligation to wear masks or to organise special departments in hospitals.
The Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the establishment of an epidemiological plan on the television program Prima Partie, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized cases remains low.
Vojtěch commented on the fact that nothing important is happening, it is not appropriate to talk about the announcement of an emergency or the re-embarkation of the crisis crew.
In view of the growing number of infected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced an obligation to wear masks at internal events of over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now there are 1000 people.
The government's procedure, when until the last moment it was not clear what measures would apply and when they would be announced, was criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of certainty and straighten the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilšer in the questions.
The measures may already vary according to the region, for example in Prague from Sunday to Sunday, the obligation to wear drapes in non-resident health care facilities, e.g. in pharmacies or waiting rooms with a doctor applies.
The obligation to wear masks during the visit of health and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday also in the Liberec and Ústí Region.
In Vysočina, Jihlava, it is necessary to wear masks in public spaces, public transport and medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures have been released in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemia Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries in colour and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In countries with low and medium risk, authorities do not require Czech citizens to test negative for coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in a low risk category.
Technoparty in Benešov continues.
Plays a third of the capacity, should end at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty at Hlaváčkovy Lhota in Benešov continues on Sunday evening.
Still a third of the original 12 musical systems.
According to the evening estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original gross estimates spoke of 300, 900 in the morning, said police spokesperson Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time a part of the music systems actually died down.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
Music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect that there will be gradually disconnection and dismantling of musical systems," said Nováková.
"The police are still consistently controlling departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breathing test before leaving," she added.
There are dozens of police officers overseeing the event, there are foreign police, traffic and order police and there are also dogs with service dogs on alert.
"During this day, police officers checked 470 people moving at the venue of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were tested for breath, six of which were behind the steering wheel under the influence of alcohol," said Nováková.
A total of 95 drivers tested for narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technoparty participants, the police carried out 300 preventive breathing tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't decreased, the police would have intervened.
Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on the TV Prima Partie.
However, the number of participants fell below 1000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, nor was it requested by the health department or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (ČT) stated on Sunday that technoparty also spread to surrounding land, whose owners disagreed with the use of technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation.
Techno fans at Hlaváček's Lhoty's meadow arrived on Friday night.
The police originally patrolled a meadow in Blažimi, Benešov, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blazim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváček Lhota, where the engineers finally got together.
According to Novak, no one came to Blazimi.
A viper bite: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case of this year was recorded in Železnorudsk.
The viper bit a girl in the leg there, the year 2010, who was brought by her parents to the rescue services base there," the regional spokesperson for the medical rescue service Mária Svobodová told Deník, with the child being transferred to the hospital in Klatovy after that.
Viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and in Šumava these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of being bitten by a viper aren't too high, she's afraid of herself in normal contact.
And if she has room for that, she likes to crawl away for a loud hissing.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
But even her bite is not a tragedy, her poison is very effective against small mammals, but it will not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk is mainly in children, elderly and allergic patients.
"Man often has a feeling of vomiting after the bite, sweats, increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, weakened individuals and especially allergic individuals can experience an anaphylactic shock," said Miriam Gredová of Klatov Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the infants out the window.
He was pouring wine and throwing dishes at the police officer.
After 11:00 P.M., a task force broke into the apartment and detained the men.
Infants were immediately taken into care by health professionals, said the spokesperson of the regional police Markéta Janovská in the press release.
The man refused to cooperate with the police, threw dishes, knives, or poured wine out the window after the police negotiator.
He strengthened his threats several times during negotiations by leaning out the window with the child in his arms.
One day, he even climbed up on the windowsill where he swung.
The police are still investigating the man.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosurová prefers the tennis season to the daughter
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not interfere with the coronavirus affected by the season this year.
Thirty-six-year-old US Open 2011 champion who became a mother in June, but doesn't want to end her career yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that his family and daughter will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to Genevieve's daughter in mid-June.
"I will stay at home, spend time with my family, be with all the small milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it," said the former world leader in four games on the Australian Union website.
The WTA Tour will resume the suspended season on August 3rd with an antoon tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razie revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, moreover under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be destroyed in the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
The inspection of the live fish stand revealed that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view in the long term.
For example, last fall, the vets discovered an illegal grocery store, with almost half a ton of unmarked food without proof of origin.
For most, it was impossible to determine the date of consumption, part of the products had expired and was corrupted.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the durability date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, vets and police officers in the area of the market arrested 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, part of which was moldy.
Putin was on the phone with the Greens before the ceasefire in Donbas, the Kremlin criticises the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenský about the situation in Donbas, where he is to start paying a new truce from midnight.
According to the Kremlin’s statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament’s decision to hold local elections; Kiev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is to begin after midnight on Monday night, it is to be "complete and general" and to open the way for the fulfilment of other provisions of peace agreements.
In an interview with the Greens, Putin said that the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections contradicted the peace agreement from Minsk and threatened the prospect of settling the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that elections to local councils would not take place in the territory dominated by pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
According to Unian, the Green Office stated that both statesmen agreed on the benefits of the forthcoming ceasefire in Donbas as well as the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as the mines of combat areas or the withdrawal of part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea and Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped to stop fighting, but in occasional gunfights and artillery attacks, people continue to die on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 deaths since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but there has not yet been a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected master of the decathlon is Rykl, the seven-gauge was dominated by Novotná
The defense attorney of the last two Doležal titles did not reach the end of Saturday's programme 400, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
For a long time, a Latvian representative, Reinis Kregers, was in charge of the decade, preparing for coach Josef Karas, but he resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside Czech Republic so far, this time he was the only decathlon who got over the 7,000th border.
Other medals were awarded by Vilém Stříský and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl after the competition reminded the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because that would make the results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, and I appreciate the fact that I took a 30-centimetre personal in the distance.
Then I was pleased with the stick and I was probably disappointed with the disc most of all, there I was below average," he admitted on the Facebook page.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the seven-ball game with more than a hundred-point advantage, even though she suffered from an injured ankle on a rebound leg.
In the distance sector, however, she wrote down only 570 cm, did not throw the spear 40 meters and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná gained 5878 points and won by 241 points in front of Kateřina Dvořáková.
It came mainly far, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I desperately wished it was around the 630.
Yesterday I started to have a calf, but I am very glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on association Facebook.
Bio LPG arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per mile.
Like petrol and diesel, it has its ecologically friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite new - the European market first appeared a year ago and according to the press release of the Czech LPG Association arrived a few days ago.
"These days we received the first 15 tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed in combination with classic fossil LPG to our petrol stations," says Jiří Karlík of Primagas Association.
However, bio LPG cannot be considered bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which many motorists are fueling into their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference compared to classical LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, Chairman of the Association on Bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced specifically, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
By contrast, classic oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the vehicle’s operation on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly from the point of view of carbon footprint than that on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not the emissions of CO2 from the exhaust of the car, but the ecology of the fuel production, i.e. the so-called part of the "well-to-tank" (Czech "source to tank").
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG are currently Petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also explores the possibility of production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to estimates by the Association in the Czech Republic, about 170 000 vehicles ride LPG; the Ministry of the Environment lists a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, approximately 200 000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered cars were converted only last year.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch reviewed the number of infected, number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers of coronavirus infected.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
Sunday afternoon number dropped from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 fewer infected.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"After a jump in the number of cured people, there is a revision of data that the health care authorities have been unable to update recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected with coronavir in the Czech Republic, 11 419 recovered and 371 diseases of Covid-19 unfortunately succumbed.
Mobile Election Units or Correspondence Choice.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for options for the time of the pandemic
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), it is necessary to change the law to allow people in quarantine to vote in October's regional and Senate elections because of the coronavirus.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday at the Prima Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find solutions within the legal rules in force.
However, the Minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health.
The prohibition on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM programme that the possibility of correspondence has been postponed since 2004.
The current bill, which is in the Chamber, then envisages introducing it for a vote abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of YES or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record to other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overestimated.
Personally, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (choices) that could be implemented this year and with the lowest possible health risk.
He considers it the main one to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence selection (either abroad or in the Czech Republic) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
Next, he sees the electoral units already mentioned or, for example, the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavirus - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Different types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year because of the spread of coronavirus disease.
Protests in Buharsk: Pig ears thrown protestors at the government building
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
This was another of a series of protests against the "Maphian style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers plan for the middle of the national blockade, said DPA.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom, had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
At 20:00, about 300 people gathered, some streets had to be closed for transportation.
The protestors in front of the government staged a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Gesev in prison in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
Both resignations are essential demands of protestors.
They also demanded the abolition of the reported reform of health care and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests Nikolai Hadjigenov said on public radio today that on Wednesday there is going to be a "high escalation" in the form of a "national demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He repeated the request for the resignation of Boris and his government, as well as the announcement of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had already said that he was not going to resign.
It was justified, inter alia, by the need to implement the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis resulting therefrom.
On Friday, however, he switched five members of his government team, even though the concessions did not calm the protesters.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov’s government stood up in Parliament for a vote of trust in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič no longer wants games without spectators
Football coach Boloni Sinisha Mihajlovič has had enough Italian League games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that since the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're running here right now is not football.
I'm sick and tired of games without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, it doesn't make me happy.
These fights are worse than training.
It's terrible to play like this, and I think I'm not the only one who thinks that," Mihajlovič said before today's match against Lecce.
The Coronavirus break is followed by series A matches in a fast sequence, and even though they are not played until the evening, their players are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
Under such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are.
Let's get this season over with.
Those measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September," said the coach, who also led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
This season is also extraordinary for Mihajlovič because four months on the bench was missing due to the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the break of the league and everything else, our team has managed to move the level up.
We want to continue to grow, and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of the cyberattack of foreign states, claims Iran
Fires and explosions have been reported from Iran’s military, industrial, and nuclear facilities since late June, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said that the fire that erupted this month in Natanz’s underground nuclear operation could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry Abbas has told journalists according to Iranian media that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks every day".
He added that it is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to bounce back.
In recent months, according to Musavi, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, which according to the analyses were based on "certain governments and groups".
According to Reuters, however, he did not disclose any details of the possible perpetrators.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
This month, an article by the Iranian state agency IRNA discussed the possibility that Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the US, might have been behind recent incidents.
But none of these countries were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tense relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran that have a hard impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US army killed Iranian General Kasem Solejmani and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3rd.
Iran then fired a number of missiles on the bases in Iraq, where Americans operate on January 8th.
The U.S. admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers were injured.
Israel sees Iran as its archenemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opposer of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is attempting to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the production shutdown, now until 25 May
Kolínská automobila Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has renewed production shutdown due to coronavir.
The production lines should be restarted on Monday, May 25, morning.
The start will be accompanied by dozens of sanitary measures, said the spokesperson of the car manufacturer Tomáš Paroubek.
Production has been due to coronavir pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
Originally, the company intended to restore it on Monday 18 May.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the outage is closed borders and closed dealership, so cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir is affected by key markets of the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom, or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the drop in production in TPCA does not sign up for life in the city.
"At the beginning it was known, the city was empty.
But the streets have been filling up, especially since Monday, when things got really loose.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with the foreign workers who stayed in the dormitories.
"In those two months we had almost no problem to solve," Kaspar said.
For example, the Mladá Boleslav Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither of the plants works at 100 percent capacity.
The renewal of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third, i.e. night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the production was restored.
There are currently about 2500 people working in TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to the family
For more than two years, she's been struggling with the insidious cancer of Gemma Sisson, and by the time she seemed to beat the cancer, the disease came back.
A 39 - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospice bed where she could still marry her love of her life.
Unfortunately, the disease has succumbed.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook social media account for the closest.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her friend Ricky Moore, who lived with her for over 16 years, traveled around the world in competitions.
Thirty - nine - year - old woman sports and lives healthy, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma started an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she'll recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to have succeeded in winning cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
According to the British daily Daily Mirror, a bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten - hour spinal surgery and then resumed drastic treatment.
But everything was in vain.
Early this year, on her thirty-nineth birthday, the doctors told her that she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, a handsome blonde decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where her family visited her every moment, who even arranged a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for the last time for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post appeared on her social media account that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this has been published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will be heartbroken for leaving my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who was by my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, saying that the pain and suffering finally ceased and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social media followers," she wrote, adding that everyone should appreciate their life and live it to the fullest.
Art automata sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, passers-by will receive a pocket piece of mostly beginner Czech artists.
Images and other works create directly for the artema, so they know that they have to fit into the size of 8.5 inches to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text in the package about the artist and then the work itself," Petra Widžová said.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can thus be surprised at the work of art he obtains.
Currently he can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutková prepared a pexeso associated with walking in Prague.
Cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packets of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the gloomy and fortune-teller cards, the second series of illustrations based on her Spiritist comic.
Health pay rises by a maximum of five percent next year.
The larger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Salaries in health care could increase by up to five percent next year, said Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (ANO) in Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
Trade unionists' demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in securing protective equipment.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (payments) may be somewhere up to five percent," said the Minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when, from March onwards, a coronavir insurance pandemic and a government regulation against its spread have intervened in the selection of coronavir insurance pandemics.
The income of insurance companies fell at that time.
"I find the increase of 15 percent unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
According to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS), the average monthly income of a physician in acute bed care is likely to reach CZK 88 312 this year, sisters 47 498 CZK.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to 7,000 crowns.
Based on the ISIS data, it also shows that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 CZK according to data of the Czech Statistical Office in 2019.
In June, trade union representatives said that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow the tables and the contract wages in hospitals, regions or private hospitals.
They therefore also require that the tables be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to 7,000 crowns a month.
For example, last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the President of the Czech Stomatological Chamber of Roman Šmucler, trade unions should perceive the state at present.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion due to the effects of the Covid epidemic, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to be paid to health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers according to Šmucler does not agree with the level of salary increases next year.
According to him, pay should be decided by hospitals and medical institutions themselves, and the extra money should go to them through a payment order.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
This week, President of the Administration of State Physical Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical aid.
He's waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now better able to supply goods than in March when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
A scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they're saying
"Smart quarantine works, there's nothing to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss this with the army tonight.
The army works perfectly, and the question is whether they should not be running the whole thing again," said the Prime Minister on Sunday on his Facebook show, "Hey, guys.
According to him, IT systems and sanitary stations are not sufficiently connected, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the prime minister in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Czech Ministry of Defence spokesperson Jan Pejšek told the Czech Press Agency that he did not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this move, according to him.
The Smart Quarantine Project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, a smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as an advisory body of the government, led by former minister's deputy Roman Prymula.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticized the scrubbing project on Sunday.
He also said that the army could retake him.
Weaknesses in the project were previously admitted by the government's IT and digitization agent Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
"The system works, but it's still working.
For 20 years, it's been self-contained and unsystematic, now we're trying to unite in a few months.
It's not going through the nozzle.
People as they go, poor people in hygiene as they go, adapt the new systems and actually pick up the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won't run for office again because he doesn't want to "stupid in politics"
The current Ostrava Mayor Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "do not fool around in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the Bureau of the ANO movement, has been Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost one third of the electoral votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I could hold on to one term, and with the experience of the business, I could turn everything around and get on my feet," he said.
He added that, for the second term, he had been persuaded to some extent.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around with this policy," said Macura, who described himself as a heavy introvert, who is not comfortable with frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been some speculation about Macuro's possible end in the YES movement.
The server recalls that Macura criticised the ANO movement several times, such as for alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities of YES, he supported the election of Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš.
Macura is not planning to leave the YES movement he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is coughing into it, I have no immediate motive to end it," he said to Respect.
Sixty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was among other things the director of Walmark pharmaceutical company.
He also sat in the authorities of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
At the end of July, Uber will return to Brno, which offers transport services.
This is a consequence of the change of the law, stated on Thursday in the press statement of the Brno Councillor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
The taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as the designation as a taxi or a taximeter.
By changing the law, however, the conditions for operating ordinary taxis and alternative taxis have changed since July.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is a consequence of the amendment of the law which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
The taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as a taxi or a missing meter.
The court issued a preliminary order prohibiting Ubera from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year at the end of the year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions Uber could ride in Brno, but the company did not use it.
They will now return on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a meter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too luxuriant celebration in Brno: Flying chairs landed a metre from a man on the sidewalk
The office chair flew out from the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and landed about a metre from the sidewalk.
At that moment, a pedestrian went after him, who immediately called the officers.
The patrol noticed an open window under which the chair was still lying next to a couple of cans and butts, just after arriving at the address in the western part of the city.
"The ear, which was carried from the room on the fourth floor, indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers went out in the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men from 26 to 29 years of age for an explanation," said police spokesperson Jakub Ghana.
Request to appeal Rafaj discuss Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss the request to appeal the head of the Antitrust Office (ÚOHS) of Petr Rafaj on Monday with the coalition social democrats.
Rafaj was called to appeal by non-profit organizations at the meeting of the Government Anti-corruption Council as well as the Ústecký Region.
Social Democrats say that the exchange at the head of office is appropriate.
According to information provided by ČTK Rafaj, he was not invited to the Office of the Government for Monday.
The second mandate will end in the middle of next year, and cannot be appointed for the third time under the law.
His appeal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
Among other reasons are the recent cases of Rafaj.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would get acquainted with the materials and the government parties would take a "some opinion".
He also stated that he had not yet dealt with the challenges with the President, he did not have an appointment with him anytime soon.
According to the OHS statement, there's no reason to appeal because Rafaj wasn't charged with anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz have written in the past week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Governor Jiří Čunk.
The meetings linked, among other things, to the decision-making of a controversial new Zlin hospital project worth eight billion, which Chunk is hard to enforce.
Chunk admitted to the meeting, according to him, they worked together on his Senate activities.
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The representative of the Ústecký Region called on the Government to appeal Rafaj at the end of June.
It also asks for reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the ÚOHS regarding public contracts according to Deputy Director for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has the characteristics of arbitrary.
Last March, police intervened in the antitrust office for a tender to choose a toll.
This June, news server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written on the company of the influential behind-the-scenes player of ČSSD Alexandr Čuba.
The advance of 3.5 million to the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's bank account.
The Chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition has been Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second term the President of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, the Rafajs will have their second six-year mandate.
The Antitrust Office Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it has not exercised its duties for more than six months, or significantly undermines the dignity of its office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the library of Blanen, employees collapsed in heat.
It helps the air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in the centre of Blansko regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was virtually impossible to endure.
It was so hot and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning," said one of the blank readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library of Lukáš Dlapa, temperatures in the building often rose up to 30 degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and in sunny days it works as a greenhouse.
"The sun also rests in it due to the curvature of the building for much of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem for individual departments to air out, because the window must be closed overnight for security reasons.
We often have this since morning in the library to 30 degrees," said Dlapa.
The worst part was the study room and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs, the exhibition room and the principal's office.
The climate was also unpleasant in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians at work collapsed and ended up in incompetence.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes it was impossible to breathe there," Dlapa remarked.
Originally, city representatives wanted to do air conditioning this year in all areas of the library.
In the end, there'll be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic areas.
A study room and a reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department are upstairs," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blanský investment department.
He added that in the first stage the workers had already installed the air conditioning system in the above areas last autumn and modified the wiring.
Approximately 360,000 crowns.
The Blansko City Library has nearly 3,000 registered readers.
That's about 900 to 15 years old.
The curtain of Chicago has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford's going back to the game.
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are silent about the health of players and do not publish anything at all.
As one of the few to step out of the Crawford line.
A 35-year-old native from Montréal was only present at the first training, since then he was absent in the lineup.
"I would like to announce to all of you that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and therefore I have spent the last two weeks locked up in my house," revealed the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford's ready to jump back into the full load.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
Experienced goalie won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goal range is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks await first a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the foreground.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places protested against unemployment, corruption, and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu solves the coronavirus crisis.
Manifestos took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in Tel Aviv Park.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahu for a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's solution to another wave of coronavirus epidemics.
"Bibi, go home," according to AP agency, one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the Emperor has lost his clothes," it said on another.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried in the performance of his duties.
He's being prosecuted in three cases of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
He rejects all charges and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial may take up to three years, with over 300 Witnesses being summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was confirmed in Israel, with about nine million inhabitants, by nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce daily increases in infected people.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, however, the numbers of infected people began to grow significantly again at the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics claim that the government has not helped enough, for example, traders affected by quarantine measures.
The protestors are also bothered by the government’s conflicting guidelines in the fight against coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out by firemen from the wreck.
Tragic accident took place around 23:00 at Neveklov's on a narrow district leading from the Slapska Dam.
Apparently, the driver flew down into the woods at less speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be removed from the wreck by firefighters, among other things, by cutting off the roof.
Officers are looking into the circumstances of the crash.
They ordered a forensic autopsy to explain, among other things, whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is making a major change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to spout one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest environmental polluters is not news.
Thus, billions of clothing ends each year in incinerators and landfills.
The view of the slow fashion, often despised approach to dress, has changed quite quickly over the last few years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which has been sold thanks to the discounts, is simply not going to buy.
The company does not want to spout one collection after another and at the end of each season the products will be cheaper than their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and blind follow-up of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most discount traders already count when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It is actually a bit of a scam," says Michal Mička, owner of Pietro Filipi.
Moreover, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our product is made of carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands absent any discounts is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," Mička adds.
Giant graffiti presents RAF squadron Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work, said the proposal liked the management of the city.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton’s organization, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939 Taussig arrived in Great Britain, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations early in 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known by people in the street graphic arts industry under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the warm streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the surfaces that were reserved for these purposes by then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
The storm Hanna arrived on the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight SELČ for today) on the southwest coast of the American state of Texas.
He hit Padre Island, Texas, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and weakened into a tropical storm as he moved over the mainland.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong wind and intense rainfall; along with local floods, according to AP, electricity outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a natural disaster for 32 counties in the southwest of Texas on Saturday and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given by people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and the Bay of Mesquite Bay, but the element is supposed to hit the territory nearly 500 kilometers long before it gradually moves over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes can pose a threat," warned the US National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, local time (in the afternoon SELČ) moved in the area of the American-Mexican border and was accompanied by wind at a speed of 85 km/h.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year’s hurricane season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by wind speeds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but as it progressed to land, it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which once again eliminated Hanna from the hurricane category.
The authorities called on the local population to survive the storm at home and not forget the hygiene measures involved in preventing the spread of coronavir.
Texas is one of those American states that the pandemic of covid-19 disease plagues the most.
Due to existing security measures and the need to maintain distances, evacuations are also a major challenge.
The temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In the Hidalgo district of Texas, one of the buildings was also designed as shelters for evacuated people who had a positive coronavirus test or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuations to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter, if possible.
"We haven't even got it over with yet.
We are expecting catastrophic floods," said Chris Birchfield's AP agency, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts suggest that in some places up to 300 millimeters of rain could rain within a few hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimeters, which, along with the swelling of sea level, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Lipk
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipk on Wednesday.
This is based on an overview of the Ministry of Defence's expected events.
The reason for lending the rank of Brigadier General is the August arrival of Lipka on the post as Deputy Commander of the Alliance Multinational Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the Czech army's ground forces.
The government proposed promotion to Zeman at the end of June.
Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as Deputy Commander of the Multinational North-East Division in Elblag, Poland, which is in charge of the Alliance forward presence in Poland and the Baltic.
In March, Řehka became Director of the National Office for Cyber Security and Information Security (NEW).
The government has suggested to the president that Lipk lend the rank of Brigadier General.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the duration of the elected post or for the duration of the service assignment which the higher rank requires.
The post of Deputy Chief of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general rank.
A soldier to whom the rank has been conferred has the same rights and responsibilities as if he were appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that corresponds to the rank in question.
Lending rank takes until the reason for which it was provided to him.
"Colonel Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
In June, the Ministry of Defence stated on the proposal for a promotion, which is an important contribution to the performance of the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of the military's participation in foreign operations.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar and Chief of Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer announced it.
Among the agreed standards is keeping distance or wearing masks on the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain vacant.
The Reuters agency informed us about it.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we were able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must be plenty of fresh air on aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
On the Arctic Spitsbergs, the temperature record fell, they measured almost 22 degrees.
"The record in Longyearbyen fell 41 years ago," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
On the evening there the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, thus breaking the record of 1979 by 0.4 degrees, added.
Roughly 2,000-year-old Longyearbyen is the largest city in Špicberky, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Spicybacks heat faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers arising from warming other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, as stated in last year's report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Špicberky has increased between three and five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it may even rise ten degrees if the greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere do not decrease.
Temperature growth in Špicberky can result in the melting of ever-frozen soils, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads, or airports, and causing more avalanches and landslides.
The Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, that depend on the ocean’s ice cover, also threatens climate warming.
The British returning from Spain are facing a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain that were not necessary because of the risk of spreading the disease.
So the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must be isolated for two weeks.
New rules come into force at midnight.
"Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list," she said.
As Britain’s Metro newspaper noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the very popular holiday destinations.
The British are concerned, among other things, whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a 10-day vacation on Lanzarote, scheduled to leave on Tuesday.
They've been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and my daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as an engineer, and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after my vacation," said Metro Hunter.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemics.
In the last two days, over 900 newly infected have been added there every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening up coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia, trying to limit all nightlife in order to prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently highlighted the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The government will discuss the model of the purchase of electricity from Dukovan
On Monday, the government will discuss the model of the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The draft law provides that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference is paid by all consumers via tariffs.
In the latter case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have already stated that the more likely option is that people will save thanks to the construction for electricity.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The intention has been criticized by environmental organisations before.
"The purchase price may be below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will spread among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or electricity consumption - with higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated in the material documentation.
Havlíček stated in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would rise and people at the construction of Dukovan would earn money.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per year on the family will be far less than the people pay in electricity invoices every year to support the so-called supported sources.
He had already estimated that the purchase price could be between EUR 50 and 60 (about CZK 1320 to CZK 1600) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any draft amount, it is to be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which the traders are now most stocked, is currently around EUR 45 (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"With the difference of the purchase price and the market price of electricity of ten euros, the average household could make a surcharge with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-member households, standard equipped with electric appliances including electric hobs and ovens, but it does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," the Ministry of Finance said.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
Coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a highly speculative issue," Tomáš Voltr, CEO of the Energy Financial Group, told ČTK earlier.
The proposed law provides for the purchase of the MIT or its authorised legal person owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer until the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines electricity as a power plant with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with installed capacity with a minimum power output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to the tenth expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The government approved the financing model for the new Dukovan bloc on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the State without interest, with a 2% interest rate calculated on the basis of the operation.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model; it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
In May, the CEO of CEZ Daniel Beneš told ČTK that the expected total for the construction of the block at current prices is approximately EUR 6 billion (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the State and ČEZ on the construction of a new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn two billion media tourism support material.
Material, according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns on media, Internet and billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic, has withdrawn the Office from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) server SeznamZprávy.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry justified the plan by the decline in tourism due to coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media and the media experienced a decline in income.
The proposal sparked criticism of the opposition and representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the hlidacstatu.cz website, MMR planned to give money to CzechTourism through the state agency to promote tourism in television, radio, press, Internet, billboards or railway stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most of it would have been private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weekly newspapers would get 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would get $350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at stations or subways.
The tourist campaign in the Czech Republic should start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is certainly not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová said without further details to the List of Reports server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová would benefit media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this pretentious contempt will be struck between the eyes in the autumn of the election," she tweeted.
Dostálová rejects the fact that this is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she said on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she said.
Initially, saving tourism makes no sense to a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a useless advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the cock of beer and death like a blade of grass
The third album entitled A Death is a blade of grass by a Brno poet, a tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who left also a year ago on May 24.
In Frič's discography he is the fifth item and, like previous titles, here is the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which he himself is an excellent performer.
Frič, the 1949 year, was naturally influenced by the American Beat Generation, but this inspiration was passed through its own, distinctive experiences and also very inner manifestations of faith.
Of course, he was far removed from any agitation, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, totally tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradíček, for example), the masters forgive me.
Frič's album offers recordings of authorial reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians, who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was violocelist Josef Klíbr, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I can help myself - I like - in the words of Ostrava's poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poems.
"They were filled with a proud and endless bitterness," says Hruška, "above the state of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into dull consumer vanity and greed, is getting further and further away from what his soul was made of - the secrets of faith, humility, and human proximity.
In them the need for those who know that the values for which he was created are of little concern, but who also know that only because of general lack of interest can they not be renounced.
The poems reminded us that you may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how you lose it.
If he sells out to general decline, he will sceptically resign, with fear of silence, or remain calm and proud of what he believes and loves until the last moment."
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamáček said
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
Chairman of the Party and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamáček said it on the Prima Partie TV show today.
On Friday, he informed the news server SeznamZprávy.cz that Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor.
"We write a text from time to time, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that, however, this is not official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with MEP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many members of the ODS still "listen openly to the views of Václav Klaus".
According to him, this is okay because it is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is having an affair this year's cucumber season.
Server ZnamZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek performs the role of Hamacek's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as Vice-President of his party LEV 21, was heading to the fourth place of the candidate party in the region of Ústí nad Labem.
Hamáček said today that he would not comment on the composition of the candidate until it was finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile's head start, it's a kick in the ass, woes the Swede's challenger.
It is the 22-year-old American stickler who has ambitions and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, and last year he was overpowered by the NCAA College Meeting.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won and I was second, then we swapped.
In both cases it was a very good fight," Nilsen describes, who secured his victory with a power of 5.95 meters.
But since then, Duplantis has skyrocketed and is currently alone in the highest bars.
In just twenty years he became a world record player, this year on February 8th in Torun he surpassed a bar of 6.17 meters, a week later he added an inch in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters at the age of 18 when he graduated high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from boy to man, he would multiply all his potential and talent by ten.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he believes.
Even if Nilsen’s list of achievements is thinner than the one he boasts of Duplantis, the American sets out similar goals.
He indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, and this February he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won the gold medal at the Panamanian Games in Lima, already in 2017 he made his way to the American World Championship, where he finished 13.
The nearest milestone for him is to try Diamond League for the first time.
"It is definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Pan-American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and the rest of the stickmen time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere silver fight?
"Everybody's trying to catch up to him, but I don't think that's gonna be possible anytime soon," Nilsen thinks.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's got a mile ahead of everyone else in training."
And by the time Tokyo 2021 starts, he's gonna want to raise it.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of years of disability retirement on an infirm son.
She's in for a trial.
The money a 33 - year - old man receives from the state as an invalidity pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzling, there's a woman in prison for up to eight years.
Because of poor health, the court removed a sick man from his right, and appointed his mother as a guardian to manage his son’s money, among other things.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 to January this year used part of her son's disability pension funds to deprive her of CZK 440,000," said police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová, adding that the accused woman was particularly obliged to defend the interests of the victim.
A woman, as instructed by the court, set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her bank account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of the son in the medical facility and the payment of the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to purchase the vehicle, electrical appliances and the running of the household," the prosecution says.
That she couldn't use her son's money for her own good, the woman confessed.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems with our incomes to tighten the functioning of the household.
We've never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things the son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, says scientists after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican State of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spears or spear spikes.
Scientists have found that the oldest tools come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said Archeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies published on this topic in Nature magazine.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a large altitude, has been inhabited for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely accepted theory has said that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from today’s Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear spikes used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this human culture has subsequently spread in much of North America.
But in recent decades, this model has had cracks when several ancient settlements, two to three thousand years older, were discovered.
A second study published in Nature magazine reports 42 different locations throughout North America that prove human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American mainland sooner than expected.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovi culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, on her new findings.
So far, the interest in tickets fills the optimistic scenario, claims the sellers.
Gradually, prices are also decreasing
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half that, but demand grows by up to 20 percent every week.
According to sellers, post-crisis developments thus fulfill the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of tickets are gradually decreasing as well.
According to retailers, the most sought-after destinations are mainly South European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At Letuška.cz portal, flights to Split in Croatia are the most sold.
From other countries, the most sought-after UK is, however, one of the busiest destinations ever.
The average fare is also reduced.
The portal Letuška.cz was around 6250 CZK in the middle of the month, 3000 CZK less year on year.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 % of sales.
However, prices are also falling in some European places, such as Spain or Italy in recent weeks, by about a fifth.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, because they are concerned about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of the ticket before departure was reduced by about 10 days year on year.
"This confirms the future trend, when people will order tickets much less in advance, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, Vice President for Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average reservation time before departure is 21 days.
Together with the growth of sales, the number of renewed air lines from the Czech Republic is increasing.
At the Prague airport there are currently regular lines to more than 60 destinations.
It is about half the destinations against last summer's season.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the dart battle live at Nova Sport
The second most prestigious PDC tournament has come to the grand finale.
It will present experienced 44-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and surprise tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson took out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the spreadsheet.
However, he and James Wade had dealt with it, and in the quarter-finals, he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home world number one.
"Flying Scotsman" was very close in the semifinals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated in overtime and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the finals of the tournament, which he dominated already in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensura Suljovich 21:19.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and perhaps knowing that it has nothing to lose helped him to play on a fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darter first surprisingly eliminated Nathan Aspinall's world six, overpowered Jo Cullen in a dramatic battle, and defeated Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp start.
The big check was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the beginning, but in a calmly playing Belgian, he gained an excellent lead in the series, which he then kept to the end, more or less without problems.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he struck out with intermittent uncertainty at doubles.
Cases of coronavir increased at least from the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has demonstrably infected 15 212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are ill.
It's based on data on the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times in a row of two hundred.
Maxim was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday there were 235 tested positives, a day earlier 246 and on Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 were infected.
9,590 people have been cured from covid-19 in the Czech Republic, i.e. 63 percent of all so far infected.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus, 19 of whom are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, per 100,000 inhabitants, is still showing Karvinsko, almost 59.
The following is the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected patients, new measures have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday against the spread of coronavir.
People must wear masks at internal mass events of over 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven infected with the new coronavirus has already crossed the 16 million threshold.
According to the American University of Johns Hopkins, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the victim's balance with covid-19 disease is close to 645 thousand.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; 15 million fell on 22 July.
In recent days, the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million, and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, had the largest share of rapid growth in the number of cases.
The infected are now increasing at a record pace.
This week, the World Health Organization announced that there were more than 284 thousand new cases worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous states such as the US, Brazil, or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in almost 40 countries around the world.
These include Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The disease has already occurred in almost every country in the world, and the first case has been officially announced by the DPRK today.
Domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Health is bad for air fresheners and deodorants
Health endangers not only poor air quality in the outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israel’s human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is important to focus on household pollutants right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of an epidemic of coronavirus, which has forced many and keeps forcing them to work from home, people must spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households," said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, the quality of the "home air" is hardly addressed by anyone.
At the same time, things you normally come into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides may be dangerous.
"The poisonous gas also produces clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," said Abraham.
According to her, children, old household members, and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Other health individuals may also begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances may damage the internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all pollutants come from objects inside households, but the material from which the houses are built can also be sourced.
Václav Havel Quiz: How long did he spend in prison and what made him write Charter 77?
Fuenlabrada lost its chance to advance to the highest Spanish football league because of the coronavirus infection on the team.
The management of the competition originally cancelled the postponed duel of the last round of the Second League, in which the team could ensure their participation in the playoff.
Fuenlabrada announced 12 infected people on Saturday, making the total number of positive tests for covid-19 in the club climb to 28.
Due to the disease on the team, a Monday duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had a point to get into the playoffs.
The competition management said today that the duel against La Coruni definitely called off with regard to higher power because there was no time to play it.
Fuenlabrad has taken the decision.
On the contrary, La Coruña is rebelling against the non-playing of the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save, but it is considered unfair that the last round was not played out according to the practice complete in a uniform term.
The leadership of the former elite Spanish club is threatening to fall into the third league by trial.
The first two teams of Huesca and Cadiz have the certainty of progress between the elite.
The remaining third forward spot will be in the playoff clash Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter discovered it.
"Daddy didn't have to have him for many years," she revealed to Aha! Gott Dominik's eldest daughter, saying that Master could not come to Havel's name and whenever the speech came to him, Karla was always upset.
It's hard to tell what they did to each other, but according to Dominica, the dispute started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in his drawer at the time of darkness, but if he had resisted in any way, he would have had an end to his career," says Gott.
Next, however, he adds that the Czech greats eventually found their way to one another.
"I know Havel couldn't hear the word until he was 60.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter for his birthday and suddenly Dad's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
After all, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Dad then regularly invited Mr.Haul to his home on Bertramk," added a blonde whose father died last October.
The Nightingale was also sad that he had never received a state medal from Václav Havel.
After all, he received it in 2009, even though it was already from his successor in the position of Václav Klaus (79).
Another honour will come in memoriam, the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to grant him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
From Tuesday the Czech Republic is in danger of heat, meteorologists warn against fires
The warning of meteorologists from high temperatures is valid for Tuesday afternoon for the whole Czech Republic, except for the Karlovy Vary Region and also for Southern and Central Moravia.
" Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in Central Bohemia," they say.
They encourage people to keep drinking in the heat and reduce body weight in the afternoon and noon hours.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a threat of fire from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists against the risk of fires concerns Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ustecký, Karlovy Vary and Plzeň Region.
The fire warning will be in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect any more significant rainfall to mitigate the risks in the north-west and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week," says ČHMU.
The Prague Magistrate responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning the formation of fires at risk points to apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires in parks, gardens, or forests up to 50 metres from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will apply until further notice, informed the Prague Magistrate's spokesperson Vít Hofman.
