Black box in your car?
While American road planners are trying hard to find money to repair a crumbling highway network, many begin to see solutions in a small black box that can easily fit into the dashboard of your car.
Devices that track every kilometre a motorist travels and transmits this information to the authorities are at the heart of the controversial efforts of Washington and the state planning authorities to renovate the outdated system of financing America’s major roads.
Usually, drab highway design has suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed to allow the government to use these small cabinets that would record miles and maybe even where you are going – and then use this information to build a tax area.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the mile of the road on which he drives.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, to test.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter where we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who plans to start monitoring the mileage for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
That's what this technology is for.
The idea is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by taxes paid by Americans at gas stations, is down.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in transport policy from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system of paying for a mile.
"This seems to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometres travelled.
It is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change the behaviour patterns of drivers, for example, which can help reduce congestion and create greenhouse gases.
California’s designers look to this system in planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for mileage.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who urged Congress in 2011 to go in the direction of paying for a kilometer.
Last year, the US Senate approved a pilot project worth USD 90 million, which was supposed to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing members of the population, whose daily life often means to travel many kilometres for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The hottest is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the biggest experiment in the country.
Soon, these drivers will start paying the state taxes for mileage, instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is looking into the project right now.
Illinois is trying to do so to a limited extent for freight wagons.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not just have supporters.
In Nevada, where the equipment was recently equipped with about 50 vehicles of volunteers, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"The Big Brother type surveillance and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs strategy management and operations at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the US Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into fully-fledged tracking devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that inevitably expands to register daily trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few countries that is trying to find the available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometres the car will travel, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hunting for such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was originally not involved in the action to help the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through on the emerging legal liability insurance market, where drivers would pay on the basis of how far they'd go.
But this device that it is testing attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only delivers limited amounts of information that are regularly uploaded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you don't follow their speed and location," says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage travelled by all citizens of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay extra parking hours fees, to provide insurance by mileage, and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to participate because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's project document states.
However, some transport planners would like to know whether all the discussions about paying per kilometre are just a huge substitute problem.
Officials of the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could easily solve the problem of a bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid or other vehicles that do not use much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when it is enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka negotiates for the ČSSD.
Social democracies are crumbling, folk and grandmothers are talking and preparing a common approach.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly aligned partners, who will put on the table a list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD ambassadors will then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political grémium and, above all, forced convicted liars to resign.
Only he is the confirmed negotiator for the party so far, the other members of the team will be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the Gremium and now to the citizens.
You shouldn't lie in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after the meeting of the narrowest management of social democracy.
He added that he did not cling to the post of First Vice-President.
"I will announce my decision on 10 November at the IOC," said Hašek.
Similarly, Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the Jeroným Tejc parliamentary club spoke.
However, he pointed out that he was elected only two days ago.
Both Members then declared that they would do their best to make the 50-member ČSSD club sound with one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theatre with a sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decision of the party authorities."
So another lie on the air.
Or did he forget, in the call for Sobotka's resignation and his elimination from the negotiating team, that in August, the InVC agreed 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was a candidate for the Prime Minister's party?
The head of the ČSSD, however, created a powerful army of enemies by calling the IOC until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this institution and the media with a bunch of gossip and rumours, eventually recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be heavy laundry, signs of dark alliances between Zdeňek Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
A friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
Controversies will bubble up in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The warning is the words of Ostrava's mayor and Sobotka's ally Peter Kajnar: "I signed Chart 77 so that idiots would not rule the country."
If the InVV were to meet this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
Traitors will bury their heads and stay.
And now the winning ČSSD boss ends up nicknamed Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doktor about problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a tiny smile, and then he just takes a deep breath, "It's hard."
The cooperation with the organization team of the 2014 Sochi Olympics is, according to Martin Doktor, a little more complicated.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the Czech Olympic mission chief.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on essential things not so much.
Maybe we've been working on them for three months to get them to give us how they're officially labeled individual villages so that we can do a whole bunch of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They're still communicating in a lot of things.
Is the Olympic village at least finished yet?
But it's no longer a catastrophic state.
A month ago, we used to walk around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean that they're empty?
Do you need finished floors?
Just basic concrete, that's what the state was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26th as a vanguard, it will still smell of glue.
And if they don't make it, what's it gonna be?
President Putin would have driven an army there?
I guess that's what's gonna happen.
Just so it's not that Olympic village = Potemkin village.
They're more likely to fail to adjust the roads, for example, and they're not gonna finish the details.
They may be in such a state that we'll have to take the boots from the London Games with us.
But I believe they'll sort it out somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number is changing.
Figure skaters, for example, are probably gonna ride in that three-way drive.
Nobody has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there on January 26th.
What will the houses in the Olympic village look like, we know.
We even measured some of our own things on the subway so that we wouldn't just trust the sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what's the mission chief doing a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I'm preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm doing a routine agenda in terms of communication with the Organizing Committee in Sochi.
Putin promised an environmental Olympics, he's got a big secret garbage dump on his plan.
Winter sports fans are already cutting a metre to start the Olympic Games in Sochi, while others are looking at their preparation with increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympiad, even if it doesn't start in February, is struggling with another scandal.
The Russians seem to fail to fulfill the promise that preparing and holding games will not disrupt nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After all, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a bar built very high, Canadian games entered the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
But it seems that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to organize zero-waste games has long since taken over.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a huge landfill of building material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of construction material, tyres, canisters and insulation foam was found by environmentalists in August, which was immediately reported.
The Russian authorities repented and the dump disappeared.
Only for a little while.
Last week, reporters got a look at a dump the size of three football fields.
Not the only one, in the area of such places there were several, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian railways, the state monopoly, are working on the site, which builds about a 60-kilometre journey between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
One of Putin’s close associates Vladimir Yakunin has led a company that has already swallowed 280 billion rubles.
In August, the railways resisted the founding of one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been running around the village for three months now day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the Soča water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimaev of the ecological nonprofit organization EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem with the Russian Organising Committee and the Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
To compare: Sochi games will cost 51 billion dollars, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost 43 billion.
Last year's London games cost only 19 billion and the mentioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected while working at the sports and infrastructure exhibition.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth to protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are coping with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given as an assignment to design a house on the plot, which lies on the corner of two streets, while the land itself is somewhat sloped.
The request further stated that two generations would live in the house who would like to live together, but each should have their own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping property.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place in the design."
"Three different functions of the house are connected several ways through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
Parents' household is at the garden level with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories bind.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in various final arrangement of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been shaped using boards, the part where the office is, is plastered white and the remaining elements remain in clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, making the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
Parents’ household, kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
Interconnection of the interior with the exterior underlines the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues into the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs up the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall through them.
That's what architects were trying to distinguish the house from other people's and to print something unique.
The young couple’s household is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room combined.
It is separated from the terrace by a glass wall with sliding doors.

The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the lobby and then climbs up the staircase.
Defend academic freedom, that goes for Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, teachers, and the management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've seen more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused to give a lecture by the Honorary Chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovec during the election period, even received a reprisal in the form of a non-invitation to celebrate the state holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer brave and visited Miloš Zeman made possible: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of the promotion of politics at universities.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as staying as mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the ČSSD governors, who are simultaneously acting as a Member and a Governor and, like them, degrade both professions?
That's what you're saying to people, you can handle both of these challenging functions.
I know we have here the example of Michal Hasek, who can even handle a few dozen functions at once.
I don't think that's exactly an example of a person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who prefers to leave the parliamentary post so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the office of dean is that you will be violating the apolitics of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current presence on both posts as an advantage for the University.
But you'll be able to help your school without staying dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion to that of me and rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face on.
Otherwise, the voters may be able to calculate it for you in the next election.
And that doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovice, the cabbage is bubbling, chemistry is not added to it.
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut in the coming months want to produce in the Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and lasts for about six months.
Since 1925, he has been producing healthy delicacies here in a traditional way, i.e. by pedaling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, it's a rarity.
Our worker found a ten-mile line behind the shift.
Each of the ten tanks can accommodate 15 to 30 tons of cabbage, one can be filled with three shifts," said David Kladroba, director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
The cabbages are transported to the company directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko.
Fruit's staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the brooms and throws them into the ring.
From there already chopped cabbage falls into swimming pools of six meters deep, in which the hookers work tirelessly dressed in white clothes and boots.
That's how they displace the unwanted air.
The last layer of sauerkraut is covered with tarpaulin and loaded with water.
"The green ring then matures for six to eight weeks with spontaneous milk fermentation without any added substances supporting fermentation," said the director of Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production under domestic conditions, individual layers of workers sprinkle with salt and cumin.
The cabbage after fermentation goes to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet and sour fillings into sachets or jars and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “co-operate” with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence snitch, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to give evidence to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
On Thursday, German MP Hans-Christian Sträbel met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, which he passed on to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to be in opposition to desertion and seeks to criminalise political speeches with heavy lawsuits that leave no room for defense.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
The tension in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when the NSA claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel had been eavesdropping on her phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament who runs a parliamentary panel overseeing intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US,” this should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a Member of Parliament on behalf of the German Green Party, posted on his Twitter post a photo with Mr Snowden.
Two German journalists accompanied him on their journey to Russia.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he had left one day.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe there,” said a member of parliament.
In his letter, Mr Snowden said that he faced a harsh and persistent persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
But he said that the whole world’s response to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and high officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the discovery of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
We're sorry about the killing, but we're innocent.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Red hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is former head of state.
During the Khmer Reds, which relied on a mixture of maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture, and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the then population.
This commander of the infamous S-21 prison granted the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia a life sentence in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan argued that they believed that they acted in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the actual extent of the killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered Red Khmer's cadres to "treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Red regime, told AFP that she could not accept Nuon Che's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"He doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she added, adding that the Khmer leaders are "worse than monsters."
The "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer regime of Ieng Sara was also to stand before the court, but he died this March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, found in September 2012 an incompetent trial due to dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Reds Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 for the deposit of hand luggage on board on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand luggage and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said that passengers will be able to keep the whole can.
The new baggage charge relates to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so that small luggage under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier says that it will charge USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance, and USD 100 if passengers will wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's spokesman Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
The airlines started charging for first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed in hand luggage hidden in storage as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take less stuff on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it very clear that it is increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper storage space.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in line at Frontier’s gate can bring luggage for which he will not pay anything, while the other passenger in line for the same luggage will pay USD 100.
O'Malley said that the website and the check-in procedures will be modified to ensure that passengers learn about the charge before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new baggage fee will not be valid until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see another baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost Allegiant Air company later followed its example.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says the Air Transport Adviser Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s carry-on baggage fee would be USD 50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual charge for carrying luggage.
"Getting on a plane was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my career," he said.
I expected to see teeth screeching and fighting at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the boarding took place in a flash."
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice to Spirit.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
The water will continue to be served free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly attempted to introduce drinks fees, but withdrew seven months later following passenger complaints, and no other significant airline did.
The last move by Frontier to charge for hand luggage if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline, its last effort is to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel sales such as Orbitz from 10 to 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than to do so through internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the furthest way in this area.
In September, she began to give only half a mile to customers who bought through the Internet travel agency as part of the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for flying miles to 25 percent of the miles from the route.
So a journey with Frontier, 1,000 miles long, purchased through an internet travel agency, means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seats in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and money is being lost.
According to the financial results indicated on Wednesday by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and traffic capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
By selling this airline, the Republic is also trying to solve Frontier’s financial problems.
NSA websites are not accused of falling hackers, but of "internal error"
The mysterious National Security Agency said last Friday that her website fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not an attack by hackers, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the e-mail agency said.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the blackout was caused by the attack of DDoS (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Previously, the NSA spokesman for ABC News reported that the Agency's internal sensitive networks were not "at all" compromised.
The speaker said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed that she was responsible for eliminating NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target websites with information until the servers overload and the site falls.
This cybertic tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
In recent months, the former super-secret agency of the NSA, once nicknamed No such agency, has become the focus of public attention to foreign and domestic surveillance programs and the target of biting criticism, collectively, the product of the theft of NSA secret files from the Agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
The profit of Bombardier fell due to a decrease in supplies and orders
On Thursday, Canada’s aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 percent decrease in net profit, which is due to a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any data on the flight test for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft would comply with the ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times and the question arose whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not fill the estimates, and stock market shares in Toronto fell by 8 percent.
On Thursday, state bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating from “higher returns” to “sector performance” with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While smaller supplies of aircraft were expected, the profit margin in the field of transport disappointed us greatly," Doerksen said in the client report.
As the trial programme continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders from Cseries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market skepticism to rise against this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will fight their way into the lower market area, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March and after a few months of delay the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft is modest 177 because potential buyers are waiting for test flight results to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and savings on the costs of this transport aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director, Pierre Beaudoin, expected that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and media that the programme was proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in the conference call and noted that the ground check and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's outage.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the others should not be long after.
Yet analysts are skeptical of the fact that the first customer could start operating the Cseries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan for putting the aircraft into operation and will provide updated information in the following months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – although consistent with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that putting into operation will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
From USD 172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, in the third quarter ending on 30 September, Bombardier’s net profit fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share.
Adjusted yields per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover dropped marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to IBES, Thomson Reuters’ analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft producer indicated that it had supplied only 45 aircraft over 57 aircraft a year earlier during the quarter in question.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which does not change even as of 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low reception of orders and the overall state of the market let us down," Beaudoin said.
The revenue in the aviation industry dropped 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, reported that the yield in this division rose by almost 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion as of 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
Profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the realisation of several large contracts.
Managers have stated that new projections will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google’s financial director Patrick Pichette, fell by 8.5 percent during trading on Thursday afternoon to USD 4.83.
On Thursday, the Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft producer and closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10 % drop in quarterly profits.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in jail.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass on information to the king of the underworld to Neil Scarbrough.
The attorney feared his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The top defense attorney, who informed the drug mob about a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42), after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, had to pass sensitive information on to the underworld chief Neil Scarbrough about his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated by criminals as the best attorney, was arrested at his home in 2011.
Officers spotted Sarborough (32) leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, which was just having dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to get information on the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his associate.
At the time, all four suspects were being followed in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After arresting heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million, along with GBP 200 000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison together with them.
Ditta (42) was passing information on to criminals for fear of developing his addiction to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works with Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, had a disgraceful time before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
He confessed to possession of cocaine during an earlier hearing.
The lawyer’s fall occurred after Scarborough’s police investigation found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded him arriving at Ditt's house, and saw him placing drugs of 60 percent purity under a lawyer's black golf glove basket.
Subsequently, Scarborough and Ditta, who had dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, were in a regular phone conversation.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
It was said in court that there were traces of Class A drug in his hair, wallet, and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, and said he talked to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation fell under "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
When questioned by the police, he said that he operated an office at both his home address and the workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work.
However, after key arrests, the court heard that he had contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than a lawyer in a criminal law area? ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as an attorney and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation has obstructed as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta did not bring his profession a good reputation, but he dishonored it.
He got too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta refused the offence and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and I would like to pass information on to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately.”
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr Ditta himself became a criminal in the criminal area when he started getting drugs from organized criminals. ”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organised crime groups, who have given him the task of gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and have confidence in the public and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
A unit for serious and organised crimes in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted for three cocaine possessions and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We'll find you and put you in our court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Another 35 persons involved in trafficking were imprisoned for 153 years in total for drug offences.
On his website Ditta held an online interview about himself in which he said that his dream work would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a guest at dinner would wish Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for the work he stated inequality.
He negotiated the government with both Klaus and Spidey.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won 14 Members in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of social democrats or representatives of YES.
But they are entering into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to argue the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who, for the People's Party, tuned the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrei Babiš do not have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a brand new party.
"Experiences were minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press outraged by the controversial media law
"It is a frightening report and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply wiping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said the newspaper calling the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is the extended hand of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star daily, the bill effectively conveys “complete control over the media” to the government, and Standard reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya has “severed a hard blow” and criticise the bill as “hard”.
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by the Islamic gunman in the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The anger of the authorities was turned on by Kenyan media as it broadcasts a security camera footage, on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looted a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and a media executive for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after media pressure.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, along with the risk of “listing off” or may be denied official press accreditation.
The General Court shall also have the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is one fine enough to eliminate most radio stations.”
It is also said that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere.”
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what can happen," wrote the journalist of Nation Mutuma Mathia, describing Kenyan media as the key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back into hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts imposed by the National Wage Agency and to renew their fat salaries of around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month, which thus ranks among the highest in the world.
Savings must be made, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea with what interest
More and more Czechs put money aside.
Yet they do not reach the champions in saving in the region.
Most of the money is saved aside by the Austrians, who save an average of EUR 181 per month.
A little more than the Czechs save even people in Slovakia.
This is reflected in the Erste Savings Barometer survey in Central and Eastern European countries.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the rankings of savers, in Romania and Serbia, people saving products are still using very little.
For example, almost every other Serb saves "under the pillow" at home, according to the survey.
In the Czech Republic, the number of people who save more money per month increased this year.
Last year, between a thousand and 2.5 thousand Czech crowns, 26 percent of respondents put aside for a variety of savings, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly deposit in the year-on-year comparison decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is supplementary pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of construction savings is declining, and the interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to the previous year.
Only 16 percent of respondents use them, while it was almost a quarter of the people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save money, most of them do not know what revenues they make on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is interest-bearing.
On the contrary, 73 percent of those surveyed have the best knowledge of the profitability of their stored money, among people over 50.
In the international comparison of Erste Czechs, 44 percent of people regularly use online banking.
Followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12-percent distance.
The UN celebrates the new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations is starting to work without delay on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that now is the time to "rear above national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – the SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the objectives of sustainable development, which builds on the success of the MDG.
The security concerns of Mozambique are escalating because of the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founder’s president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to call out peaceful slogans to a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
For fear of the future of her country, she traded her business clothes for a T-shirt decorated with "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia, and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an attempt to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After a peace agreement in 1992, he became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that open conflict is unlikely to break out in the country again, but recent events startled foreign investors and locals.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of large coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest can bring investment worth more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and America’s Anadarko, over the next few years.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tension.
The Renamo party claims that the government has sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault of former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo base and attempted to kill Afons Dhlakama, group leader, said Renamo Fernando Mazang's spokesman for the Financial Times.
The government is accusing Renamo of triggering conflicts because he said he was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebusa tried to alleviate his fears of instability.
On Wednesday, Mr Guebuba said to the French press office AFP that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever was left of his strength to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr Maranga's words were quoted that Renamo is withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
France Télécom said that it meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but seriously," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate tensions between these parties, fueled by a series of clashes this year.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebusa and Dhlama), said the lecturer at the Open University and an expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither is a good negotiator, and neither is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who sought electoral change, has already said that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a dying movement to obtain benefits and financial gains from the government.
Renamo’s voting share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Mosambika movement (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuba – who ends his second term next year – wants to destroy this country's democracy.
"The democratic system does not want more parties, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because it does not want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what possibilities the Renamo party has, but it has carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between north and south.
Most of the skirmishes occurred in the province of Sofia, which is several hundred kilometres away from the capital city of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely, are exporting coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased government frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development, and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president are solely responsible for the country's future and that he should be the one who finds a solution to the problems," he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends like “models for a way of life,” says the author.
Tales of Thor may show that “gross power cannot be compared to cunning,” while Arthur legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would be “too wild for school teaching, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of age.
"I think it is great that myths and folk works are already part of education," he said.
I've defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly instructing" authors and teachers are like a "off switch" with a captivating story with a "underlime" message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, who also writes Norwegian myths (Penguin Book) and British national legends, says: “You may have good intentions, but you’ll do better to keep them to yourself. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children requires a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended with a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly determined.
The old truth about it is better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory takes visitors into space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can dive into new comfortable seats and over their heads added a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is twenty-one computers that generate the image," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a coherent impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than that of classic personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician from the observatory.
The nigitarium can conjure an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or ocean floor.
The audience will find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of man.
Another similar device is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project purchased shows and their own works in the hall.
There's two shows on since Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut, and it's for adults.
In it, people learn about astronaut training, fly into space, turn to centrifuge, and then see the challenges of astronauts in the cosmos in illustrative examples.
The second show is for children and it's called the Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a reef whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano exploded.
The entire digitarium cost approximately CZK 50 million, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed with smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost CZK 10 million, the projector cost 12 million.
"The rest swallowed audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
Digitarium installation followed the reconstruction of an entire building that the observatory passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, between 25 and 30 thousand visitors could come by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 THOUSAND OF INSERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important media for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey first took place, 26 percent of the survey was carried out.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) it has stabilised to around 60 percent.
According to the analysis, job opportunities advertising largely reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in periods of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reference period, less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is focused on a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said Pavlína Šťastová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies for both media.
Advertisers looking for managers and managers, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the lead on the Internet.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation belongs mainly to the service and labor professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently stated requirements expressed by employers through an advertising offer.
Other areas of interest included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for foreign language knowledge was stated in 3% of advertisements, 37 percent on the Internet.
Only 2% of employers’ advertisements required an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Entitlements to 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in the daily press at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally associated with qualified professions.
They are mainly production managers and other managers.
For the workers' professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical equipment, the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employers shall also, in the middle of their advertisements, indicate the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most frequently required skills, communication skills have long appeared in the first place in advertising.
In addition, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is where a solo comical performance was born in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chair of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the gathered people by means of an interview.
Faye's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
Founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Carolines' solo comedy institution, she celebrates her tenth anniversary this year – along with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too big to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes", the annual musical comedy benefit at Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has spread, so has the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as the show in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll went up with his sitcom (a cheerfully spicy "League" on a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now he has his own comedy show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the Saturday night live program and the Parks and Recreation program, but she became most famous for the fast-moving series of "Markel the shell with shoes on" videos.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, snarky, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest moves of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but he became a successful TV and film director, as well as an unofficial comic historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he held a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in Larry's entire work's comedy DNA," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the aisle between two buildings and he's like, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil continued to fall to $96 per barrel.
The oil price continued to decline on Friday, as the high stock concerns were offset by a report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-hungry production sector.
America’s oil indicator for December’s deliveries fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange during the late morning.
On Thursday, the drop was 39 cents, and for October, it fell by 5.8%.
The rich oil reserves in recent weeks have burdened the price.
On Wednesday, the Department of Energy said that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production gave rise to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after the growth that has risen to 7.8% in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent oil, an international oil indicator also used by American refineries, fell 26 cents on the London International Trade Fair at $18.58 a barrel.
Oh, no, Mr. Haschek.
We have a unique way of telling politicians that this is not the way it is.
There must be enough pressure for Martin Hasek to be deprived of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so slim.
Martin Hasek protects himself with the promise he made, but everyone and the politician must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš has the material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr. Haschek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm it, if you didn't just lie - here you see how difficult it is with lying), you leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, even a flawed person or a life-long squalor.
You may find it unfair to address only you, but you're the leader and they're the misguided sheep.
And you're the leader, and you've always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to bend your ears for a while now, regroup your powers, sit here and attack again, but that's how guerrillas or backstabbers act.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the regulation on the procedure for stopping and searching persons by the police department in New York
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the court order requesting changes in the program of stopping and searching persons in the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Federal Court of Appeal said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the decision on the city's appeal.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city had its conclusions and corrective regulations, including a decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its procedures and its training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested postponement.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be removed from the case because she was in conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, by not acting as a judge according to the requirement to avoid appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement which she openly responded to on the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search persons.
It established independent supervision to oversee major changes, including reform in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launching of a pilot programme to test the cameras carried on the body in certain areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after the police search.
The oral justification of the city’s appeal is planned sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people criticized a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form there has been a stopping and searching of people for about a decade, but recorded searches under the direction of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically grown to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a case of group action.
Supporters of the changes to the program of stopping and searching persons carried out by the NYPD claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and can influence how other police departments use these procedures.
Opponents claim that changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that money will be wasted, but the wider problem will not be solved when the police force is under pressure after its numbers have fallen by several thousand people over the last decade.
The judge noted that it did not end the practice of stopping and searching persons who are constitutional, but reformed the way the police department in New York introduced searches.
A fifth of shopping malls face low attendance
This is based on data from real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague's Bohnices, the Kraków Shopping Centre is opened to the public, it will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
There are now 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Dissatisfaction is about 20 percent of the medium and large centres.
The main problems are the inadequately large center towards the location and bad layouts, too many floors or complicated and confusing arrangement of passages or dead points of centers," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of the retail property department, Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the shopping centers are struggling with low attendance.
The main reasons include, among other things, poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or market oversaturation in a given location.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are rather conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres must try harder to 'entice' their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupation of shopping centres is generally stable, even for some centres it is rising, because the landlords were willing to reduce their rent and hire some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened which are not fully occupied and thus reduce average occupancy (e.g.Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
According to Sylvie Samadi, shopping centres opened over the past two years have been pushing very slowly on the market.
However, there is a market place for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', aimed at purchasing and services of daily needs for people living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, they see the space for the upcoming business center on Vítězné náměstí, and they also have the clear potential of Na Příkopě Street and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, allowing traders to cover and expand to smaller towns for favourable rents and operating costs, and the space is also available in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstructions such as the reconstruction of Prior shopping houses, which benefit from a good location," Dita Kubánková of DTZ added.
90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million sqm of gross lettable areas are currently located in the Czech Republic.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, there are nine of them in Prague, results from data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check his tip.
The former newspaper editor News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods “to hack into the phone, monitor, and confront” to confirm the fraudulent tip of the love relationship that then Home Secretary Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis at Old Bailey's trial said that News of the World intercepted false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned a private investigator named Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and infiltrate her privacy, but it was said in court that Coulson called her and left her voicemails.
"The state representative suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but the person who likes to put stories under people's heads to see what they have to say," Edis said.
He said that the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, tracking, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, he knows about the other one, the surveillance, he needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say: “Of course he does. ”
Rumors about the love relationship Clarke was involved in were first captured by the NotW News Department when sources who were sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby were said: "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
The recording of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
While Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Pawlby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, former Chief Rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former Rapporteur James Weatherup were supervising Mrs Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, in which he told her: “I received a story that we are about to publish tomorrow and I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as other prominent personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
It was said in court on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman while he was seeing a co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied any association with other persons for the purpose of hacking into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
Uncovering the NSA increases social paranoia surveillance by the state
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Home Intelligence Agency, the mission was to take photographs of the US forward patrol roof, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claim that BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event launched an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again in September, insisted that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “stole the trade secrets of foreign companies in favor of US companies and thus boost their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But ever since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading businessmen, no longer know whether to trust the words of the director.
After reports that the US National Security Agency was spying in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data with which US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have achieved widespread paranoia about state surveillance of new dimensions.
The last straw came with the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone might have been bugged for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the leading entrepreneurs are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey issued in July by EY consultancy, German companies believe that the US now poses as much risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft.
However, there is no evidence in the whole dossier revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and stated that it should seek to limit its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about it.
There are voices from the German Parliament that we should produce German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical refinement of the American spy agencies exposed by Snowden is still shocking for some companies who have so far believed that China is the biggest threat to surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have realized to a wider extent that data stored in the US falls under the jurisdiction of the US, and that is why they are potentially countervailable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-American members have cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the USA after the discovery of the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snape, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “Do we have a new question for customers who were not here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets, and that data must be protected at all costs.
It's no surprise that economic espionage is being carried out.
It's always happened.
"It has been a fundamental topic for many years and this has not changed significantly during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Agrochemical Company.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to brag about the countermeasures they have taken to possibly not give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi’s Board of Directors, says that it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a meeting of the Board of Directors to prevent them from being used as listening devices.
The German BfV advises managers to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign travels because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be thrown out.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading global market leaders in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," he warns in his BfV report.
The US warns its own society of economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington post, the National Intelligence Estimate presented France, alongside Russia and Israel, in February, in the second row, perpetrators who engage in hacking activities for economic correspondents, just behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free society concluded that as far as economic espionage is concerned, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in one of the talks this month: “Services know quite well that all countries, even when working together to fight terrorism, are spying on their allies. ”
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a tangled wrestling spirit at his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th, stuck in a flattened ghost behind the stands at the high school gym he went to.
Sheriffs' investigators at Lowndes County County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the 17-year-old's family rejects it.
"They are firmly convinced that their son was murdered," lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They believe that this contradicts logic, physical laws and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a body bag," he said.
Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
said Moore at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told the press that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of a "positional asphyxiation".
According to Moore, however, the second autopsy gave another cause of death.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he discovers enough evidence in Johnson's death case for a warrant to investigate a crime or violate civil rights, he'll ask the FBI to execute it.
The Deputy Sheriff's Office of Lowndes was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance video footage that the investigators examined.
The parents of a teenager hope that the videos will contain a clue to how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in case of child allergy to food at school.
This is the first set of directives issued by the US government because the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergy in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how the teachers’ choir and staff can make children’s food allergies aware and respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline at their disposal – the most frequently used EpiPen automatic injector – in order to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone's fucking in my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "Itches my tongue".
Parents of intersexual children may choose “undefined sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an ambiguous genital tract.
Newborn children will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to list any sex for such children and allows them to list sex as “indeterminate” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to make hasty decisions for their child to perform a sex-determining operation, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
After many years, according to the BBC, one intersexual person said: “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I'm going to remain a plastered doctor, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that out of 2,000 children each year, one is born that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, glands (eggs or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
The determination of gender is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to identify gender, it is better to use the best available information and identify it instead of waiting and following the psychological and physical development of the child until the surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determining problems, said that the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
Gender determination can be performed without surgery and then the identity can be waited to evolve.
Knowledge of how a child develops sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not linked to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the work area, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to mark male, female or “third sex” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexual" person to win a court appeal so that she could retain the status of "undefined" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, German passports, except M (man) and F (woman), will have a third designation, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to news reports on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “sex theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website online also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With the world dragged to a new state, when sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization upside down. ”
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would rather see children assigned sex at birth.
"Parenting itself is stressful without any further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek who had double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be erased and redrawed.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, with the fact that sexual affiliation is a complex matter, and sometimes doctors can make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call for a psychiatrist, you called for a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex was submissive.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – how parents raised their child – affected children's genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theory became questionable.
To the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged because of badly circumcision, he recommended that his child be castrated completely, removed his testicles, and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had his surgery back to the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still using this model.
But in the '90s, with the Internet coming in, survivors of these operations appeared "dissatisfaction with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but an ambiguous sexual system.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
He got female hormones when he was 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18, he was sent for vaginal surgery.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genital system.
After he learned the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses and had his breasts removed,
Surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Advocates for informed choice, based in California, fears that the German law “calls for branding and stigmatisation.”
"Many activists fear that the German law will bring about encouraging parents to make a quick decision and choosing 'undefined' for the child," she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We think it's better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.”
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is going to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a young child should not be able to bear at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist in Pittsburgh's chest, who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would "give authority" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie's female traits developed.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a uterus or ovaries.
Now, 29-year-old Katie is married, and she works as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania in child psychiatry.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law will give parents some space so that they don't rush to their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run some tests and think about it and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman".
Everything is fine in this respect – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful baby and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds the parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child decides with which sex he identifies more – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunkard poured gasoline all over the house: He threatened to burn it down with his own family!
Tensions were increasing, fear was escalating.
The man threatened to burn the whole house down.
As a result, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a fire department from Mladá Boleslav and a volunteer fire brigade unit, set off on the scene.
A police negotiator came to the scene and tried to talk men out of their irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to burn the house down.
So a task force had to break into the house to disarm and bind the men.
The aggressor then finished his exam at the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was transferred to the alcohol interception station.
Finally, the fire department filled the house filled with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition, all domestic animals were also saved from the house.
A man didn't give a damn about a police negotiator, so a commando went after him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest advisor secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine received a copy of the book coming in and announced on Thursday night that the president’s top coworkers held intense group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama’s fading hope of re-election.
According to the National-Political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and at the White House, namely the former White House Chief Bill Daley, to measure the effect that former Secretary of State Clinton would have on the election to move her former Secretary of State to Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama’s campaign leader Jim Messina, and former chief advisors at David Axelrod and David Plouffe’s White House – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was a representative of trying to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not increase the chances of Obama.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I have intensively explored a number of things and this was one of them," Daley said.
You must remember that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we thought, "Jesus Christ, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley described research as "decent care," Martin told Anderson Cooper at CNN that the re-election campaign had made considerable investments to see if this move would pay off in the election.
"In campaigns, such money is not spent on elections and qualitative research unless something is seriously considered," Martin said at AC360.
But it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential card shuffle.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential changes, the former head of the office admitted that he was "possible", that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on removing Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea when he read the technical treatise on the jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes luminescent.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, so the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the "Lick me I'm delicious" ice cream company, says: "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're in the beginning, so for GBP 200, you get about 2 g of it."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, it increases the pH and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it in the last few months, and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it's causing this fantastic radiant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because it's four times as expensive as gold.
And so every hill costs me about GBP 140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is to be even more ambitious.
He says: “I really want to make invisible ice cream. ”
Basically, it's impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice, but I'm counting on some way to do it to find out.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially manufactured by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a cheapskate.
There hasn't been candy in my apartment for two years, and this year probably won't be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, the black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I look forward to every Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, out of 6.9 billion dollars spent, 1.2 billion are expected to go into costumes.
This year, the latest fads of fashion are sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; hot can be food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the dead parade, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans are spending $330 million this year on animal sweetheart costumes.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kilos of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers candy, and Clark bars.
That's an amazing message for 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, we consume 45 million kilos of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Candy Association around Halloween, almost 16,000 tons will sell.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing's more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror behind the walls" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that, according to American haunted houses, have $500 million in profits, and that includes those amazing photos that you're pissed on and put on Facebook by your friend, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will look at the picture and post a comment like "nice faces."
And finally, a little something about pumpkins.
Ever since we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us to a large pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving pumpkin lanterns is like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the trend of "baby in pumpkin" started only last year thanks to the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up on the fact that we carved the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Counting, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting up their pumpkin weighing almost a ton.
Announced series of Land Rover racing
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as communication equipment.
The choice is improved brakes, service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between individual races.
Drew Bowler, the technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The contestants coming to the Bowler have changed. ”
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as an achievable journey to world class races.
We are happy to offer them this trip in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
Chairman TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election shortly.
A week after the last one in the interview for Aktuálně.cz he said there is no other way out and every government that came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible glue.
"It cannot last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that the period of life of the starting term is estimated within two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose otherwise next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a more balanced decision."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (compared to 2010, it lost about 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if within two months it was clear that the early elections would be, it would strengthen the ANO 2011 movement Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
Turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret Ian meeting of a party leadership party, said that either he or Michal Hasek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"Heads of the Democratic Party as small boys go to the head of the state to enable them to revolutionize the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was more clever and intelligent."
"Because I have never seen anything so badly done in my life," said TOP Chairman 09.
And in the direction of President Zeman (who he encountered in the struggle for presidency), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over the party."
The first laws have already been tabled by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Farsk Treaty Register, which was discussed by the House Committees before the elections, but fell below the table with early elections.
The Chairman of TOP 09, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, claims that such speed is due to the need for "these laws".
At the same time, the TOP 09 obviously wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 of the idea of "stealing" the ANO program by introducing a contract register.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply brushed up on a proposal that has already begun in the second Chamber of Reading.
Fire squads have come to rescue a lost puppy that's stuck 15 meters above ground on a dangerous protrusion in a stone quarry.
Cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog saw him trapped in a stone quarry.
The firemen have come down the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire units, which came to rescue it after somehow trapped itself on a dangerous protrusion in a stone quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine - month - old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days on his own until he was rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit stone quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they were feverishly searching for their lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday at about 14.15, a sharp-sighted doggie spotted Ruby stuck on a protrusion in a stone quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and was rappelling down to free Ruby, using a transport bag for animals to pick him up from the rock.
The technical commander of the tech rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
He got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The sighting of a dog is incredible.
The technical chief of the rescue team, Peter Lau, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape. ”
There was a chance that he would be hurt very badly or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a physical, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Looking at the rescue, I was scared. ”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in my arms.
The vet said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're so grateful to them, they were all just great.
Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there. ”
The fire department was great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that Katy Perry definitely didn't go after that 18-year-old.
This week, during an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said that she sang accompanying vocals for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" from 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with this rock veteran when she was 18, and he went after her.
She added: “That was a long time ago, and now he is very kind to me. ”
In a statement of Thursday Jagger's (70) deputy said that he categorically rejects, that Katy Perry would ever make suggestions.
The deputy said: “Maybe he is confusing him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted in the first place this week.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be a condition for its accession to Schengen.
This gave cause to stories of passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this was not reflected in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws to suit them.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen right now, the offer of continued inconsistency would be a cheap concession to Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old that he became a digger, a journalist's duck that "independence means passport checks", I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting thought in this bearded tale.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London Chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
In the face of the euro crisis, the so-called Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, the party's dedicated opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro is gaining influence as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of the Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came out of nowhere and already in September’s federal elections captured almost five million votes, thus essentially “vauling” the Free Democrats (the equivalent of British Liberal Democrats) from Bundestag.
On home soil, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a straitjacket attached to national economies through clinging to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit – that was only true for Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the area of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public spending – which Germany encourages.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is a deeper cause of European malaise performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies on consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for petrol as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even all the wage freezes in the world would not turn away the suffocation of the European petrochemical industry by cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering rebellion, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand up to Washington in the world.
However, Paris no longer needs and has promoted its own economic policy in Europe as a card of political legitimacy, leaving the French economy worn out.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that right-wing fission will automatically be positive on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
Next year's European elections would like to use them to create an anti-European block across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block can dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
In doing so, I think that the growing anti-European feeling and the stance against the common currency will come together and the euro will perish.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn into something more free in the sense of “Europe (sovereign) nations”, already preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and connect to the United States.
But Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of telling Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed European order, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The government of the SNP in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement not promoting austerity in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance on the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland were to vote for independence now just to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Advanced early
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are involved
Experts claim that one of the triggers of early puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so evident in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter's breasts and pubic hair begin to grow at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time convincing my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair and underarms and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, the average age now is 12.5 years, compared to 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years will pass before the first period," Kaplowitz said, author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed what activates the real beginning of puberty, but when breast growth is accompanied by growth purtus before 8 years of age, the girl is considered “prematurely mature”.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which children’s doctors can closely monitor.
A faster growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: early aging of the bones, which may eventually lead to a cessation of growth and dwarfity in adulthood.
Recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he acknowledges that “repression of puberty can ease the problems of a girl’s behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers. ”
There is another big problem: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They are concerned that he can get pregnant or how he will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter began her period at 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones are to blame in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz asserts that the most serious reason is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001 he helped to conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9, which links body fat to the timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although in young boys, facial hair and pubic hair appear, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added further complexity to this topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We must be careful how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist from Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from their pediatrician on how to speak to their child.
"It may mean talking to the child sooner than you would have expected," Kaplowitz said.
If you remain calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who have evolved before need to be assured that even when this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Konvalinkova in the role of innkeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalinkova (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of pub and she was very good at it.
That perhaps the popular Czech actress planned a change of profession and started a business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinka appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was good at it.
My boss even offered to hire me and I could spin beer for a living.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I am doing today, acting," Konvalinková told Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and sometimes I have Irish whiskey," the actress revealed.
Nadi, a longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový, appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I'm not allowed to drink in my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that's what I'm trying to keep," said the actor.
Aircraft manufacturers are arguing about the width of seats, big orders are at stake
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, the second class seat width dispute was lit up for long-distance flights, which this month gave rise to a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.
The object of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for the economic class long-distance flights – not the one usually preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week Airbus called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The dispute arose at the time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-distance aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear part of the aircraft is distributed – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats side by side – is the basis of economic performance requirements for the design of new aircraft “mini-jumbo”.
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" delivers 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 will deliver 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus now ahead of the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what the start of a new advertising war could be when he showed the financiers a picture depicting three people sealed in a restaurant with the headline “Would you like it? ”
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
As the food supply changes, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49, according to the US Department of Health, increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it has carried out research that suggests that an extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Airbus rejects the size of the seats and says that it is not up to the aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
"It is really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they must do to be successful," said the cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
Greater space for elbows is essential for passengers, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute, there is a race in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to deflect the weights of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing argue that they achieve 20 percent better efficiency for their latest design of two-engine long-range aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend partly on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seater concept.
"The reason why Boeing is doing this is to fill more seats and make his aircraft more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser distribution that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"A four-inch seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus, the design is motivated by the threat of model 777," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer airlines a supplier catalogue to choose.
Traveled aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band to check the competitive arrangement.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't been sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cab modifications by offering wider seats in alleyways for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of one other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unanswered, but can discourage the wave of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV-infected patients exceeded 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people grows every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and by 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected, and it was a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country last January to September, with 176 patients this year during the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
There were 206 infected in the Central Bohemian Region.
156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravskoslezský or 116 from Ústecký listened to the diagnosis.
The least infected came from the Highlands, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were born with HIV, transferred from their mother.
Nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, the experts claim
Fantastic film from the Universe Gravity for some time after premiere sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic.
In October, it was seen by the Union of Film Distributors by nearly 150,000 viewers and made over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
Others, however, find some discrepancies.
Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I like scientific and fantastic films, which I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film Gravity does not include, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which somehow doesn't float in a weightless state.
Hubba's Space Telescope and International Space Stations are moving along distinctly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some viewers blame the unrealistic effect and the entire behaviour of the fire in a weightless state.
They don't think the suits would last that long either.
Heroes in Gravity often get into collisions with different objects and suits without much difficulty can withstand everything.
The criticism was not spared even the plot.
Such an extensive tragedy in the orbit of the Earth is unrealistic, according to some discussing it.
Besides, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technology.
People also argue in forums about the "nerve" behavior of ropes.
They say it looks like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the City of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen, but I can clearly say that I was charmed.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than the inconsistencies mentioned by you, I was affected by the three-time display of a space station with a degraded level of technology (last Chinese)."
"Chinese, after all, will be at the end of the decade and will probably look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in trying not to break the laws of physics, and so a naturally oriented viewer appreciates the fact that during various cosmic collisions and collisions, quite correctly retains the moment of momentum, i.e. the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including the thin skin of the atmosphere and the polar glow that fling around the polar regions.
Irregularities are bound to be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, when reading comments, for example, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic debris in orbit appears to be reversed in some scenes before it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but no major and calling offenses against logic or natural laws have been recorded in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, it is evident that the creators have taken care of the credibility of the events displayed.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that Hubble's space telescope orbits a different orbit than the ISS.
The result is a very different mutual speed and therefore the rescue operation could not actually be done as shown in the film.
Next, at the moment of the Kowalski and Stone (Bullock) department, I did not notice that the entire ISS rotated, therefore there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both players to let go at the moment when they no longer move against each other.
A new nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of vaccine could protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Prior to human trials, further tests are needed, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Medical Faculty of Weill Cornell, New York, says that the first signs are good.
"We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that it can overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus designed to carry genetic information to produce antinicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies persecute all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they enter the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In the vaccine mouse tests, which were subsequently supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But the mice that have not been vaccinated have “calmed down,” said researchers, a sign that nicotine has entered their brain.
Experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain sufficient antibody levels, thus proving expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus avoid addiction to nicotine.
More likely, however, it would be used by smokers to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they will have no enjoyment, and that will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for the Supervision of Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing coastal lease policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its search to see if Mr Obeid lobbied with several state ministers in order to rent him the Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, renewed without having to participate in the tender after its expiration in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by former Deputy Head of the Office of Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of the talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for rentals to enter public competitions.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer term contractual terms.
In 2009, rentals for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought $2.5 million a year to the Obeids, were renewed without the need to participate in a public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of calls submitted at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodi and Mr. Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
“Was the subject of interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty, Mr Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said responsible officer
Israeli military aircraft hit a target on Thursday night in the Syrian port of Lazikiya, confirmed by the responsible administrative officer of Fox News.
This responsible agent did not specifically say what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press Press reports that the targets were the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an air attack on the supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pecinka spoke in such a way that he could agree to this, whereas Chairman Štěch was stirring up discord.
He was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and he remains a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses in the first place.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek has made the most impossible conversation on television.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to propose Vice-President Gajdušková as Prime Minister, the only one would not have had an initial handicap, and I think she would have done a standard performance.
It's such a good solution, it's hardly anyone in charge who can support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdušková could, without fear, build a minority government with a mere blessing from President Babiš and without the People's Party, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a believing social democrat.
This mini-minish government would have great stability, because it would promote a proper referendum law, and that is what the President of the Dawn of Okamura would have undertaken to support.
President Babiš would eventually accept the tax progression, for he is sharp and will see that he can't do it without her.
People would not cause problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they would not be in the government.
The same is true of YES, even here would be found a valuable minister, but if they wisely do not want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, also well.
Let's give Alena Gajdušek courage!
Foreign workers with a visa authorisation may undergo a ‘legality’ test
As the government intends to extend police interventions, it is considering a 'legality' test for foreign workers with visa authorisation of 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied by means of criteria to prevent 457 from being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was released today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it might offend Australian neighbors.
“Loud statements “foreigners at the end of the queue” and “work first for the Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant from the time the unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said today for the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white labor force was to be protected – and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region had noticed an echo of this historic artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he was dealing with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes, and the rest remain to be considered.
If the ‘authorities’ criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or a personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers, but then employed hundreds of them, 457 visas may also be required of businesses.
Meanwhile, a 35 - year - old man from Sri Lanka, who sought asylum, died suspiciously of a heart attack after arriving this week on a sanctuary ship to the Christmas Islands.
A man’s nine - year - old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat.
The Australian authorities and the man rushed to the hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the advantages of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said that the project "will bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" by working with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
When phase two is completed, the line from Manchester to Leeds will lead.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connect Great Britain and its cities.”
We've given SH2 a green light, because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a connection – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across Great Britain thanks to HS2.
Scottish minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "really" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed line has the potential to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railway across Britain.”
So we are eagerly working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland and thus benefit everyone and supplement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British ministers over the next year, and making joint decisions on further steps.
Together with Bárta, the anti-corruption police analyst also arrested the inspection
Information on the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the report was delivered by server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS), her people were to arrest Barta in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection addresses cases where there are accused police officers, but its competence also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - head of analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek is among the arrested.
He used to work for the Security Information Service.
Jaroslav Ibehej, a spokesman for the anti-corruption police, refused to comment on the fact that the media had to turn to GIBS on this issue.
Radka Sandorová also referred to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, but she did not want to say anything about the case.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová said.
It can also be deduced from this vague reaction that the event has taken place, but is under a covert regime that does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
Bart’s lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even in this matter", but since it's classified information, he can't confirm Bart's arrest or disprove.
At first, some media speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted by Barta, together with former VV Chairman Radek John, who was in charge of the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute, which was set on fire between the explorer Petr Nečas and the VV, had even to be dealt with by then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where that connection came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about the matter," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Officially, Radek John, the real leader of the party, was Barta at the time.
Barta was now running for the Dawn movement, and he missed the parliamentary mandate just by 175 votes.
The Dawn Leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Barta was one of many candidates of many parties on our candidate and, as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who said before the elections that he gave Bart space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executors.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Travellers of Australian airlines will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during start-up and landing even without regard to changes in the US in order to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given American companies space to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the device remains in “air” mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers examine this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers in order to meet the requirements, but indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it has examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations to regulate the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with safety instructions obtained from crew members.
Virgin, who had already talked to CASA about extending the use of its on-board Wi-Fi entertainment system, was inclined to change, but announced that it would submit to the decision of the regulatory authority.
"We would welcome CASA's analysis of permission to use electronic devices, because we really think it would improve customer experience now that we have (doorless on-board entertainment)," said the spokesperson.
Qantas has announced that it will follow current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it anytime soon," he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly study thoroughly the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training material, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
"As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew shall order the passengers to turn off the device during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the overhead storage area during take-off and descent.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings at the Bendemeer shopping cent in Singapore to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house and put all my money into it," says Mrs.Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator receives $2,400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, he says.
Indeed, demand across regions in Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is such that ValueMax, where a woman carries out her transaction, has become the third pawnshop on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs.Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
That is why millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops, with families feeling pressure because of rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low and medium-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with a deteriorating financial situation.
This week the rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to the increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia due to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from medium to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Song Wun, economist at CIMB Bank in Malaysia.
Historically high prices of gold over the past two years have contributed to people’s hastily stopping their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewels for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen an increase of up to 20% in recent months in the number of customers using its pawnshop.
The growth in the pawn shop sector is so large that ValueMax, an operator of a branch in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says the Executive Director of ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 percent of the $66 million SGD acquired on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors are under attack for high interest, Mrs Yeah says that the pledge offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers stop objects they already own, and monetizing personal property does not increase household debt," he says.
In the company, the asset pledge is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use pawnshops, there are not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches to stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all kinds of circumstances.
"They belong to wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term because of their brave business or investment, or small businesses that need help solving their cash flow problems," says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as fast as possible.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for dying health care in Tasmania contains harsh conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is making "rapid measures" to avert the crisis caused by the aging population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government came up with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Additional 2600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract operations, will help to eliminate indebtedness.
The money is also available at the free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic systems of health records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to thoughts that leading clinician doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system," Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Union of Australia and inform on a monthly basis where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will be useless “until real reform follows in order to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
Yet he commended the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first made in negotiations with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I believe the federal aid package can get public health out of critical condition," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal Health Opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just a "plasty".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our medical system," he said to ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes away nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that spends $300 million and pretends it's good news.
Mr Dutton has called on Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar from the rescue package will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicoloux adapted the novel Denise Diderota, which brings an exceptional film expedition and the portrayal of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 18th century in France and tells a gloomy story about Suzanne, a young noble woman sent by her family to a monastery.
When she revolts, she experiences extremely cruel treatment from the criminally perverted mother superior and for others she becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lust or sensationalism, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that even viewers will experience torment similar to wearing a horsehair shirt.
Ski resorts want to make families with children cheaper
Syria destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, said on Thursday the Committee for Global Chemical Weapons Supervision, while severe conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where toxic substances are expected to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the deadline set by this organisation based in The Hague for the destruction or disabling of the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery production facilities for the mixing of chemicals in order to create toxic gas and ammunition filling.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to launch the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including the mustard and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as soon as on Thursday the fights in Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of the chemical weapons factory and storage sites, were reported by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in Britain.
A group of activists, through a network of activists in Syria, monitored the total number of victims, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
That's supposed to be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters, and 187 armed men from Hezbollah, Lebanon.
There should also be 2,202 government defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN Organization estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million inhabitants to leave the country.
Assad's forces fought against the insurgents in Sapphira, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observation room stated on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific numbers.
Combates have underlined the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in their mission, when Syria is to get rid of the chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW that closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that his team was now “satisfying to verify – and monitor – the destruction of – Syrian declared essential equipment for manufacturing and mixing/filling”.
He added that “no other control activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, inspectors said that they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of their safety concerns, they were unable to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two sites, according to Syria, were “abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons programme that it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked”.
It was not immediately clear whether the equipment in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I worship the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had," said Ahmet Uzumcu's observer director in his comment issued by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad’s government, with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, stand against each other in civil war.
As for further developments, the head of Rami’s Watcher Abdul Rahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday inside an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikia.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict handed down by the mastermind of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002 responded angryly to the judgment rendered on the last of the plotters who were brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people remained dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it could insist that a man nicknamed "Demolition Man" be punished for death because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived June Corteen’s painful memories, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old Jane and Jenny twins in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other plotters nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Mrs Corteen said: “He should be put in front of a firing squad.”
Every day I have to live with not seeing any more grandchildren and daughters.
The Sari club was levelled when a heavy load was detonated shortly after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 in an outdoor parked van.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and as he was kept alive, he died three times to the doctors.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamiya responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like nobody else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive just isn't.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, not so much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers on trial.
He avoided arrests for almost ten years, but was eventually caught in Pakistan’s city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where less than four months later US forces killed the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not surrender voluntarily," said Mrs Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can still appeal to the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological gains on aircraft (but they must not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – apart from calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies, and listen to music on the basis of the eagerly anticipated new rules issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
However, passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
As quickly as the change will be introduced will vary according to individual airlines, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at the press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA administration how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the device storage guidelines in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the extended use of electronic equipment very quickly," the FAA stated in its statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of three kilometers and the captain gives a warrant.
Passengers are expected to switch their devices off again when the plane is dropping to land and turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and taxiing, as stated by the FAA.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are implemented safely – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
Frankly, we're tired of looking like "watchers."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers of altitude, said the Agency.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when, as is well known, he was fired from an American Airlines aircraft because he refused to turn off his equipment when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored for fear that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the American Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, an expert on national transport security at CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"The mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference with transmitter towers in the air," Rosenker said.
In order to investigate this problem, the FAA Advisory Committee proposed last month that the government allow the wider use of electronic equipment.
In recent years, the FAA has been under pressure to alleviate restrictions on its use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskillo, a Democrat from Missouri, say there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to shut down their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radios, the technical achievements of that time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations’ aircraft, but they are also constructed, and approved by FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt under the new rules for the greater use of electronic equipment, says Huert.
Current electronic equipment generally emits much less intensive radio broadcasting than it did for previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimal transmissions when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when devices download or transmit data.
Amazon.com is among those who are pushing for the release of restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the transport aircraft with their electronic Kindle readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes that interference from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off equipment during low visibility flying.
The group of the travel industry welcomed these changes, and according to it this is a reasonable procedure for the travelling public, which uses technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognised that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
A rattler was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after previously being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue centre until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: “This rattler probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught him over the North Sea. ”
Apparently, he ran out of power and found his refuge on an oil rig.
Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help. ”
By the time he was released, he was in good condition and well health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to join businesses and define what changes British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government favours new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get caught up in a long and strenuous process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – even 40 percent of the large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, expressed their approval.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The finding that businesses of different sizes and major business groups have identified themselves with shows that the business sector is pushing for a “sense change” that will shift its influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% in a referendum for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports its plan to amend the terms of British membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and, given the way the eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union, it is becoming increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry confessed: spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, according to AFP, the chief of American diplomacy, John Kerry, admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, however, the gathering of information served to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington", according to AFP, was heard in the midst of a sharp controversy on both sides of the Atlantic due to scandalous revelations about mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which also targeted American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, like the President (Barack Obama), some of these events have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended the practice so far.
According to him, gathering information is essential for combating terrorism and preventing assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We stopped the planes from falling, the buildings from exploding, and people were murdered because we were able to be informed of the plots in time," Kerry emphasized.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The affair around American intelligence, which allegedly watched hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that Americans were also tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
European leaders did not hide indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to prohibit or significantly limit monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction started on the Bulgarian South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says officials.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” eliminated.
As soon as the whole project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says that construction is to start at the end of the year in other countries in the direction of the flow.
The gas pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They have a decisive battle ahead of them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamoon.
According to the ever more specific reports, Israel destroyed Hezbollah’s missiles during Wednesday’s raids on two locations in Western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere with the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it will prevent the transfer of arms to the hands of Hezbollah to Lebanon.
News of Wednesday’s Israeli raids on weapons warehouses in Western Syria has yet to be specified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by US sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian missile base Snubar Jabla south of Latakiya.
Al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses were hit, in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, the missiles were Russian-made SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron Ben Jishai said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah to handle missiles.
The SA-8 are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a moving chassis.
Although relatively primitive, mobility and small proportions make it easy to hide.
They're equipped with radar, but it shuts down after the missile's been fired, so it's hard to target them.
Latakiya lies in Western Syria, a region inhabited by ruling alavories.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has in the past participated in the fights in Western Syria.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community to which the allavité belongs.
Now, apparently, 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help take back the army, Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah, the Syrian army also strengthens its troops there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle is to be retaliated according to the source of al-Arabíji for the recent attack of the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army win back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many insurgents from Kusajr have just left for Kalamun.
Not long ago it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, spending money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals have been cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were in good shape.
That they didn't really mind and were actually satisfied with the state that was there (the theft and debt of this state).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not come to the elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1,016,829 ČSSD voters to the above parties, then with the old order (because all of them participated in the "stealing" and debt of this state), 64.23% of rightful voters actually agreed to this situation.
In fact, most voters have shown that they are not in favour of punishing those who are guilty of being robbed and overdebted by this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD, who participated in this work, are going to enforce appropriate laws?
Is there any way to help us?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men Association (YMCA) were charged before the actions against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Children’s Sexual Abuse Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of child sexual abuse prior to being charged against child tutor Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011.
But before the commission, it was said that in its opening statement to the commission, the association stated that they had never dealt with the case of child sexual abuse in their organization.
The CEO of Phillip Hare was asked about the case where one of YMCA’s employees was accused of child pornography offences, and the other, when the gym teacher at Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the committee's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but he didn't know about the second.
It admitted that YMCA’s initial statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which appreciated this organisation as a leading advocate of children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission indicates that YMCA has been notified that it received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society of August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the management itself from him downwards failed when he accepted Mr. Lord without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys he committed in two years when he worked at the YMCA.
He's been incarcerated for at least six years.
However, Mr. Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a child safety breach by Mr. Lord.
Staff members gave evidence that they witnessed such violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, watching them privately, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of services for the YMCA children in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was “very intimidating and often difficult to talk about.”
The Director General said that he did not accept the evidence of the staff, that they felt uncomfortable if they were to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord clouded their judgment, and that's why they didn't report the problem.
Mr Hare said that he told the YMCA Council in New South Wales that the lesson of the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organization was that the staff "did not report", and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were filed was made by YMCA's child service manager Liam Whitley.
He said that the goal was to avoid breaking the evidence, but it was “extremely zealous” and misdemeanor.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, checking, working, training and managing personnel.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
Tony Blair said he'd take a chance to return to the post of prime minister, but he admitted that coming back is unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, 59-year-old politicians expressed their views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years of leadership, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talking about British politics and restricted his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador to the Bizko-East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, the London newspaper Evening Standard quoted his answer as follows: “Yes, of course, but it is hard to say that, so..."
While a crowd of horse-showing experts were gathering in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he hasn't gone to school yet and only a few months ago he took his first steps, this little boy and his pet, Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly trod through three laps to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 towing adult rivals.
This inseparable couple – at the same height – was praised for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by Sunnybank equestrian center in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the perimeter.
Fenton was commended by the judges for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given his third birthday in March, and since then he has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony.
His mother Donna (30) said: “Fenton and Toffee work together well. ”
They did not get their hopes up, but eventually they left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and total strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing off horses for more than 10 years.
“ There was an exciting atmosphere, ” says Mrs. Howells, “and everyone cheered and applauded. ”
He ran across the whole length of the arena and even though he was so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm and got two chickens in charge.
Because of how he started, he'll be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The speaker of the annual horse show said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony. ”
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the pony and the leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best at the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped him. He really did fit in with him.
Too inquisitive a newspaper to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page requested the release of a reporter accused of slander, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
New Express, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr Chen later admitted on TV that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a society partially owned by the state.
The warden said that the New Express newspaper will now make a full correction.
The regulation for "repair" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013 the New Express newspaper of the Yangeng Group Evening News issued several false reports on this company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disordered," the administrator said in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to impose administrative punishment on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a cancellation of a journalistic license".
In addition, he “ordered the Yanging News group to make a full correction to the New Express and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the New Express management”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express on financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper issued two applications for his release on the front page and claimed to be behind his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on state television and confessed to giving false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion as well as to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he said at CCTV State News Station.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I've done wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express release an apology on the front page, stating that he failed when he failed to check his reports sufficiently.
Recently, several heavily watched suspects have made confessions on TV.
Experts say that confessions are still being enforced regularly, regardless of the amendment to this year's law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel was found to smuggle drugs between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad.
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel measuring roughly one by one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of nearly six football courses, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before the drugs could have been undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also intercepted eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilos of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of convictions, they face prison sentences from 10 to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate large-scale drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which puts the problem before drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres, equipped with tracks, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and Center connect management.
They offer, for example, joint advertising
Economia's new integrated newsroom in Prague Karlín.
Economia took the next step to transform the Centre holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and the Center have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," commented the changes made by the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Economics and appointed CEO Kamil Čermák.
The Èermák, who will be at the head of the single management, will be supplemented by the Executive Director of the Holdings Centre Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new joint director of the store, to whom the advertising director of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová is subordinate.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editorials is Vladimír Piskáček, on whose team Jakub Unger is also the director of the transformation.
Adéla Pitts was entrusted with the newly established position of marketing director.
The independent corporate communication unit is newly managed by Věra Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the production of content of all issued titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract to purchase Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuálně.cz, žená.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of nearly twenty other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly Respekt and Economia and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to a newly built modern space in Prague Karlín.
CME will target the TV business.
They'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be fired.
By the end of the year, he wants to be downsized by a thousand people.
He's going to cut off all the side activities and he wants to focus on his main business, the TV show.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4 500 people.
Almost a quarter of the people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech versions of MTV.
How much savings will touch the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the national TV number one TV Nova is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really cannot comment," said Nova's communication director Josef Koukolíček.
According to information from MF DNES, significant redundancies of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have by far the greatest impact on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both the new bosses of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined longtime director Adrian Sarbu during a Wednesday conference call with analysts, spoke about their desire to cut back on all activities that are directly unrelated to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of production of its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
The cooling tower burned down in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague at night
A large-capacity storage tank burned in the industrial complex ČKD in Prague, according to firefighters probably a cooling tower.
"The fire was fired on Thursday before 11:00 p.m., and the fire was finished this morning," Pavlína Adamcová, spokesperson for Prague firemen, announced.
The amount of pollutants in the air around the area according to measurements did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are still unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the Kolbenova Street complex.
"This is a fire of a large-capacity storage tank, probably a cooling tower," said Adamcová.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing using a transport line from tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, extinguishing the poorly functioning hydrant network complicated, so the fire department had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire chief has issued a second-degree fire alarm.
There are four levels in total, and the fourth is announced in the most serious situations.
The chemists also set off to verify the level of hazardous substances that could have been airborne during the fire.
"However, they did not measure a number of pollutants in the atmosphere that would exceed the hygiene standards," the fire department spokesperson said.
The British police delivered an extradition notice to Assange
Today, the British police delivered an extradition notice to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that he delivered a "extradition notice" to a 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to the police station and that if he doesn't do so, he might be threatened with arrest.
Assange under the British law exhausted his options when the Supreme Court canceled his appeal this month, facing extradition to Sweden due to sexual crimes charges.
As he feared that Stockholm would give him up to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard “provided an extradition notice to a 40 - year - old man asking him to come to the police station on the day and hour that he was assigned to,” said the spokesman.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears that he will be released from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he published 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to £110 miles an hour with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from the town of Tiptree in Essex was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found out he had a drink cup between his thighs.
At the Colchester Howie Police Court, he confessed to the charge that he was driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the cost of £90 and the premium for the accused £100.
As a result of the tax on owners of foreign properties, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the income of financial assets, but waits for the final decision of Mr Osborn, who presented in the 2012 budget a fee of 7% for the transfer of real estate to buildings over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
Revenue from the property transfer fee in the housing fund in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in 2012/13 reached £708 million, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “It is very difficult to argue that high value property is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the obsolete head tax system, given the increase in the transfer of property to high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance. ”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to refuse to buy real estate in London, or that existing owners were reluctant to sell.”
The front real estate – 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price – in a rich belt that extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded an increase of 11.8 % last year.
Prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6% from year to year, but were overshadowed by the booming “home market,” where according to a survey by Savills real estate agency, Southwest, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) of the increase.
Scientists explained more about how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Early research showed that happy dogs wiggle their tail more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs wave their tail mainly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these fine differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “People are well known to have different connections between the left and right sides of the brain to stimuli that stimulate positive or negative emotions. ”
We tried to spot the same thing in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs react to the disproportionate tail-wiring of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs films about dogs – whether in a natural version or silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and show it more to the right or left."
When animals saw an otherwise bland dog move its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), it remained perfectly calm.
However, when it recorded tail filming mostly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view wagging tail), their heart rate increased and the animals were insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs were consciously communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what moves they must and may not be careful about.
He said: “If you encounter dogs several times and their tail movement in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement of the right produces less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, vets, and trainers understand the emotions of their animals better.
A dog behavior specialist named John Bradshaw, a college veterinary teacher at Bristol University, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads on the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and on the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another technical treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “Dog robot was more likely to be familiar with dogs when they wrung their tail to the left than to the right, when they were becoming more insecure – quite the opposite of an Italian study.”
According to him, the difference can be due to the fact that dogs in these different studies did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots entirely as dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs react to real dogs could help.
"Although there is strong evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it may not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and another to the other.
Arctic Monkeys because of Alex Turner's illness moved up concert in Glasgow
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved the concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro Town Complex on Friday.
But Alex Turner's lead singer's illness forced her to move the show.
The group’s announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday’s performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s performance at the LG arena in Birmingham, and on the basis of medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1st.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with larynx, and unfortunately he will not be able to get off."
The gig at the LG arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21st.
All tickets to these performances remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to all those who bought tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.
If you need more information, please contact customer service at the cash register where you bought your tickets.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis, on February 22, was the first to appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope, and they are those who elect the Pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will eventually help to select his successors.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the Pope’s election – a group thus shrinks to 120 electoral cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the promotion of the new cardinals, there would be a gathering of current cardinals known as the Consistory.
"The Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero, of the Catholic Voices newspaper, said that the number of electoral cardinals would likely fall by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first after František was elected in March this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe in Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose task was to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope made all his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it was “pretty possible” that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before – it is absolutely new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he names.”
GM withdraws some new light trucks in the USA to repair seat backs
According to Friday's announcement from the U.S. automotive safety authority, General Motors is withdrawing nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, to repair the malfunction with manual tilting of the seat back.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may be defective.
As a result, seat-backs do not comply with the federal standards of automotive safety for head restraints.
The announcement placed on the website of the National Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if the car gets hit from behind, the head restraint may not protect the passenger properly, which increases the risk of injury”.
The downloaded models were produced between August 1st and September 10th.
GM launched its delivery in June and for this leading American car company, the most important issue is the marketing of vehicles from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the delivery of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcements to owners due to the 16-day dysfunction of the government, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra’s sales, which were reworked for models in 2014, increased to around 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, declared GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent to USD 37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperate Scream of Obama’s Voter
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have ruined the obstruction of the Republican Party.
Obstructive policy cannot justify the woes of Obama’s health care website or the attacks of unmanned aircraft
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris studies medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought that this book would cheer me up during my second year's gloomy days at medical school and restore a little hope to me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a memory of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews and go to bed tonight, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches took your breath away.
Elections ended with overwhelming dominance, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept the newspaper they got.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During his entry into office in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
There have been real changes in the years after I threw in my first ballot.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the law on affordable care through the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy "do not ask questions, do not say anything" after the death of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the public's choice of health care and closure of the Guantanamo base.
But after many situations when I defended the Obama administration from my colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The obstructions of the Republicans cannot explain their consent to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or to air raids of drones that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it haunts those who expose the government’s wrongdoing.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process, or for restricting public contributions and expenses during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the discovery of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... of Nixon's administration."
And most recently, they cannot justify the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if there's such a thing to be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected function obviously does not have a predictable course, and our public talks will shape opposition political parties and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above seem to a large extent to be the result of the administration's own decisions.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and uncut alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we had once heard of.
Yet the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have gone missing.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton at the primary in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to his pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over the parental leave program
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of the parental leave program, because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Mining tycoon, who runs the dispute over the payment of $6 million worth of coal tax, made this claim when he tried to get rid of the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate that play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
"He got into a big conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave, because if either of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would be given parental leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election of the Electoral Commission, Mr. Palmer officially declared himself a winner in the fight for a seat in Fairfax District in Sunshine Coast, with 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget's daughters.
Should these elections be decided two months after the polls are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come up with details on the computer, vote immediately, and get results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, you can erase the results if someone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The election committee studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political program also covers Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job “very seriously.”
The public office is a public service.
"We seek no reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Are you washing your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands will change your mind and your mind.
98 people participated in the experiment, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an unsolvable task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failure made a much more optimistic impression than the one where the participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the "washed hands" group did better in the next test than the other.
Still, those who washed their hands in the next test have achieved worse results than those who did not have them washed.
The results of the "maturated" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the test results indicate that physical cleanness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, and the testers need to concentrate much more in the next test.
If we were to transfer the research results to the Czechs, we would probably be most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but on the way by public transport it is a fifth.
After working in the garden or in the workshop, 85 percent of people wash their hands, usually cling to hygiene.
The pet caressing motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, to what extent it is necessary to wash your hands after a handshake to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," commented the results of the survey by skin doctor Klaudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that global investigations by the supervisory authorities regarding suspicious currency-market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with competent authorities in investigations into the largest financial market in the world, where each day they change owners of USD 5.3 trillion.
The two traders in question would be the first RBS employees suspended in the framework of an expanding investigation to respond to the LIBOR scandal (London interbank interest rate).
The bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our ongoing search continues on this matter and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other institutions," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event reported that RBS had handed over records of e-mails and rapid messages sent from accounts and accounts of a former trader to the British financial authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European Chairman of Cash Trading in Citi, took a leave of absence this week, while Matt Gardiner, former Head of Currency Trade in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders has been charged with any offence.
Mr Usher's rapid news group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said the people in the event.
This week, UBS stated that it had taken action against some of its employees following the notification by the Swiss supervisory authority of Finma that it had investigated suspicious machinations in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six offices – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office – are investigating the claim that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse initiated internal investigations or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combing through years of fast news and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that was one of the largest profit-making engines in investment banks’ closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation when they claimed that it was virtually impossible to manipulate a large and highly liquid foreign currency market, but high-ranking traders said that this might not necessarily be true.
A high-ranking trader said that, despite the considerable volume of daily trading in foreign currency, liquidity disparaging between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, it means that “you can begin to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released a trader from its Share Trading Department this week, which had caused a loss of nearly USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem was resolved," said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have registered over a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of monitoring in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is based on statistics from the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, there were 2,063 infected in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the immune failure disease has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased every year in the last decade.
In 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009 the examination revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010 180.
Last year, however, the number dropped to 153, but last year was record-breaking.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who has led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, tests revealed infection in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavý.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1710 males and 353 females.
AIDS disease erupted in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Who really wants to meet a city, should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the beautiful centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal the box.
Many people "read from the graves".
The cemeteries wander slowly and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what faiths they are, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social position, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how they care about their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama’s Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
With a vote of 5:4, the court decided that the individual regulation of the Law on Patient Protection and Available Care – which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they are at risk of paying a fine – does not contradict the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
President John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remainder of the Law on 2700 pages and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which requires States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise there is a risk of any financing of sickness insurance from federal sources being terminated, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
The action to block this law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primary, each of the main Republican candidates, including the presumed candidate Mitt Romney, strongly rejected the law.
For the words "Mugabe is a limp ass" there is no longer a prison, the court has abolished the law
Until now, the Zimbabweans had to be careful how they spoke in public about the 89 - year - old Mugabe who has ruled the country since the early 1980 ’ s, and since the end of 1987 he has been in charge of it.
According to section 33 of the Penal Code, a fine of up to a year in prison threatened to be fined against the presidency.
"State representatives should not zealously blame people who comment on the President in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal the court's ruling, and the British BBC has reported it.
The law was loudly defined by a number of harmed Zimbabweans, among them Tendai Dang, who were arrested two years ago by the police for alleged insult to the president in a fight with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist in public, Mugabe, ended up in prison with the swearing of a "stupid donkey".
In August, the prosecutor then accused a 26 - year - old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove false," said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who has published false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing criminalizing someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to express itself freely," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has been ruling a country with hard hands for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
A small step away from the dictatorship of one man of the country took place in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabo and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the prime minister's seat.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008, the world’s highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe pays only the currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is at the expense of Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and his war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience in running the farm.
Central banks will hold swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to enable banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"This is a very sensible step," commented Julian Hollow, the leading international economist at the bank of London, Barclays.
"So far all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is no surprise to me," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the ties that began in 2007, when the international credit market first got stuck.
Central bank agreements have allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies for anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to close its support program for the US economy, which could drive out the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is normally used to overcome liquidity shortages of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency is at the same time.
It can be understood as a repository of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered at Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish it, because someone at the branch just sat down who couldn't complete the internet registration.
And since I didn't want to go to another branch, my registration failed, then I moved and my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn't do it, because I have a different number of OPs, an address and that I just couldn't finish it and that I had to apply for data deletion and make a new registration.
That is what I did and I wrote on technical support on 24.10.2013 that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
She wrote me technical support for that on a second day to finish my registration at the branch office.
Thus began the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where after 4th Urgance 25.10. they wrote that personal data at my request had been deleted.
So you would think that you could make the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username was already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal information, but eventually they also disabled this).
So I used a different user name and it came up to me that my personal data was already stored to complete registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that claimed they deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
On my question, how can this be written back that personal data has actually been deleted on 25.10. and to send an e-mail with the error.
That's what I did (about 15 o'clock yesterday) and they wrote back to me today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why I can't do it because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been in contact with technical support for a week and deal with them that I still can't?
What does it matter that if what they say is true (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or same date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in the 13.22 I actually registered, in the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and a phone number and a wonder world, a page appeared to me that they sent me a link to the email to complete the registration.
But how is this possible if you cannot register in the same name and date of birth?
I guess it's because Tipsport ties registration to e-mail and phone number and data he just didn't disable as he claims.
So once again I have told this technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they are writing), because what they are writing is not true.
I've documented several screens that the registration problem was before 31.10. so "false" registration simply doesn't affect this.
I'm sorry, but you're already registered, we can't verify your claim.
And he shut down the comms.
Respectfully, he repeats the same sentence over and over that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it didn't actually happen.
So if I sum it up, not only did Tipsport not erase the data as he claims, but he's still lying when he says otherwise.
Even worse, it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the error is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little in motion and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was handed over for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and alerting on the same mistake).
There's music playing on the bridge subway
The Prague Transport Company launched the Music Project in the Metro.
The first vestibule, where recorded instrumental music plays continuously during metro operation, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Municipal Social House not only his completely new two CD Czech calendar, but mainly in the show Between us singers Lenka Novo, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by excellent Orchestra Matěj Benk.
After the opening intro and the acting etude about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of the last time they played in Cologne and the theatre and the whole city had a power outage.
"Otherwise, in Cologne, two types of cards were produced, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also reminded of President Zeman's native.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravce near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical work.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the clock, but he had no idea about ice hockey at the time how we met in those squares and we chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That is also the name of a song from the Czech Calendar, but we will not play it here today," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml sang from this album for him a very suitable sleep in the day, sing at night and accompany him to the guitar.
Otherwise, unless he sang, played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang a little jigsaw into the hillside of the heart, which immediately turned on the auditorium.
"I am glad you were intrigued by the song, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," responded Michal Horáček.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, she was recognizable in the performance of František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded by a huge applause, Hana Hegerová was reminded of the song Dad liked Lída Baarová and with Horace's explanation about the communist ban and the replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded by Sebastian, Segrado sang a beautiful composition by Prague, musiced by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Sásmuck and former Kolíňák.
But that was the conclusion, standing ovation and an addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
There was one more encore on the playlist, but the fans didn't clap.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček, his books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with any interested parties she took a picture.
Berdycha and Štěpánek will complement Rosol and Hájek
At the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia was nominated by the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they are going to play the opponent's field in Belgrade's arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15th to 17th November.
The Czechs have been in the final three times in the last five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we have to focus on our performance as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to earn three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the creator of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what bombing of Syria is supposed to look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements they sent planes, they hit the target and came back.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They're refusing to confirm the whole thing, and they're not talking about it anymore.
The exact opposite of confused and big-mouthed, actions unsupported by Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the entire attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be fooled by the media by their claims that the "Syrian base" or "deliveries for Hezbalah" have been bombed.
I recently wrote about the fact that while US aid to secular insurgents in the country remains on a rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply Syria's weapons.
And it was a fresh shipment of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli air raid.
It's a clear message.
And notice, Israel has again bombed Assad's regime, not the rebels, although according to popular Internet theories it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has awarded two members of the Special Forces, probably Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they had excelled during the attack on the American consulate in Bengazi.
There is a known heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA premises in the city, and I believe they were members of a CIA secret commando, made up of former soldiers.
There's been a lot of speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has protected its offices with machine-gun nests in Libya (both SEALs died on just one of them after the mortar hit) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two so far unknown heroes.
They were part of an American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received reports of the attack in Bengazi voluntarily volunteered to intervene and along with five private contractors shot their way to the CIA premises in Bengazi.
Obama’s administration is baffled by the fact that during the attack, the commando was not officially deployed and the whole thing and that it was simply hesitant to do.
Commandant, so without orders, they'll probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that he works in the country not once, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents, and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, nothing like this has officially been admitted, and even now it's just a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's a good thing that the US is half-assed about fighting terrorism in Libya.
Although it would take much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media was almost chanting Iranian air force for prosecuting U.S. drones.
But little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if the Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that Iran's F-4 Phantom plane pursued an American drone in international space over the sea, when it may have been the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He underwent Phantoma to optically verify his armor without Phantom registering it on radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared with him and challenged the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without murmuring.
It is no wonder that Phantom is an aircraft of American manufacture, but it remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful recently, defenseman Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral is in a form that brought him back to his representation after a year.
He is also successful with shooters, he is debauched with activity, after the procedure he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached out in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but finally she took one point out of these two duels.
Frantisek Rajtoral believes his team will break an unpleasant streak in a match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a difficult match with North Koreans who play offensive football.
Everything goes towards the game with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," attracts Czech fans at the Doosan Arena stands.
The last matches did not work out the way she wanted, but she rejects the word of the crisis defenseman Victoria.
That's how football works, sometimes you're in good shape, and sometimes worse.
But there's no way I'm talking about a crisis.
"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," means the defender of the West.
The Victoria team will once again rely on support from fans.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans, who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a jump a few years back, in memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and do dishes, vacuum and do homework.
Although these "obligations" were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running from school, throwing the bag in a corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump shots.
Then during the series Helena and her boys embroider with a chain stitch a ceremonial tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings finally wash the dishes, vacuum, in winter carry the wood into the tiled stoves and do the tasks after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of writing love verses addressed to school love).
To eat homemade strawberry jam in the morning (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, whose contents were not even laid next to strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mother and I liked to collect so much.
I also remember those magical nights when the grave was quiet in the room when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio to the tapes that were spinning loudly in the old tape recorder of my mom.
And then we rewinded the tapes on our pencils and played the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and they toasted it with a siphon.
Or we were on the phone over the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were on the phone to hear ourselves better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the handle was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live off it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads or even cell phones or laptops or designer clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "crust" in the wardrobe was a batiked home made T-shirt with the help of SAVA.
From electronics, we were satisfied with the mentioned mom's tape recorder and, at the most, Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used anyway only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said, "just" go out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure my parents saved on it for a long time, but unfortunately it wasn't warmed up for us for a long time.
My younger sister put a strudel in him, said he ate those tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if he was sleeping with a strudel.
Unfortunately, he did, but it was his last bite.
Well, she still has that story, poor thing, on her dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put a strudel in the video and thought she could play the recipe and not play it, which is why she still can't make it.
I remember how we all managed to communicate, communicate without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I agreed on a vacation with my grandmother's granddaughter, when we will meet again next summer at Grandma's - and that was the case, that was the case.
We met.
Promise someone to see you next year?!
I also remember the winter we used to run with the whole village outside, build snowmen, ride a snowy hill by the church on sacks of stuffed hay.
Then we had dinner together with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear that notorious phrase before every dinner, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have any soap tied to the tap in your lemon net.
After dinner, when my dad worked in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, leaned our feet against the tile stove, opened the door and watched the flame and listened to the crackling of wood pouring from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through various chats, text messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I complete these memories by looking at albums with neatly glued black horns created by black and white photos.
And if I don't know how old I was then, from behind the picture is always a year taken.
I'm looking at the fact that we didn't look very good with our mug haircuts, and we had our cousin's pants two times bigger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not in).
And I'd rather go back that step forward - to reality.
By 2013 and I will wait to see what the modern times will come up with for my children.
What I do know for sure is that these memories of me are at least "a hundred years behind monkeys" for a young teenage generation now, and I think they're missing a lot, that they're not going to have this "pre-op" time either.
I wish they had!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents that disappeared from Nortel, filed a complaint on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, which it relicated in the auction of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s USD 4.5 billion patents, was sued by Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies at the US District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to combine Internet search terms with advertising, reports the lawsuit, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on Google Android operating systems that are highly competitive with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a default bid of USD 900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to 4.4 billion USD.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for USD 12,5 billion, which was partly motivated by the Motorola patent group.
"Despite the failure to obtain in the auction patents which are the subject of the dispute, Google violated and continued to violate the patents," the complaint states.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation from Google because, according to it, Google intentionally infringes the patent, as claimed by the lawsuit.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
First, she put away a smile, the one she always put on display as a defense against wannabe friendly surroundings.
That made her very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only on the days she had her grandmother and her grandchildren Elinka or Adík.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered very well the lesson from endless courses in business skills.
Now they're finally really useful.
So she won't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a masquerade costume.
November, even another month can't do the miracle to smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one that hasn't been around for almost three years.
Egypt puts the first freely elected president in office
Muhammad Morsi took an inauguration oath, but his triumphant day is hardly the end of political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised “new Egypt” when he was solemnly put into office as the first freely elected president of that country, after Husni Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months earlier.
On his entry into office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black gowns in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for better tomorrows, a new Egypt and the other Republic," Morsi said at the ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the US and a Muslim Brotherhood member, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most 84 years since it was founded as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small motorcade shortly after 11 p.m., hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential display of Mubarak’s period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column could pass through the usually busy route connecting the city centre with the suburbs in the south.
Morsi's personal prestige, mockingly referred to as the uncharacteristic "reservative tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also to all those who want to bring about the end of the revolt against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to a judge in a wood-covered chamber where he took an oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to give an inauguration speech.
While standing at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander was Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting of “the army and the people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the University.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later became a bastion of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a revolution was born, which last year ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and solemnly promised to seize once again the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them over from the exiled leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, as is customary, he has submitted to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll probably be police specialists in the ghettos to ease the tension.
Police specialists should act in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from shanty places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior is counting on this.
According to him, an improvement in the situation in the country would mainly help to "enhance social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were 300 slums and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, especially Romani people.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It was usury.
According to the experts of the problem localities, it has increased by a hundred.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are intensifying.
In several places, anti-Romani marches took place.
Extremists were also joined by people from around the area.
According to the interior, it is difficult for police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
It is said that the 'continuous application of an equal approach in law enforcement' is a fundamental condition.
However, this is said to be impossible without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
"Thanks to their established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole series of infringements," she said.
Specialists in ghettos would get extras, up to 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into troubled areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about EUR 600,000 (currently about CZK 15,5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the total, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements here," the authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the project is completed.
According to the design of the project, selected police officers will first complete an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should undergo this training each year.
They will be the most suitable candidates.
There should also be a special education for police officers who will operate in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would mainly help to improve the situation.
They say it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet the hostel with precise rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social housing that would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to fulfill an integration plan designed by social workers.
They would have to follow the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for a job.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of housing.
According to the interior, the permeable housing system should operate for at least 30 years until the next generation "in an integrated environment" has grown.
The social housing model is prepared by local development and work departments.
They're supposed to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others is evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were still here at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, on the top of Uhlířské vrch there is a striking white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church was not preserved.
Shortly after the church was completed, an alley was planted from four lines of lip, about 1 km long.
The cross road on Uhlířské vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
On 15 stops are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver František Nemlel.
He used different species of wood from the Low Jeseník area.
Similarly, the pedestals from the rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop includes the name of the sponsor.
The coal hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from the radiometric measurements of age differ somewhat, the last eruption was here about 1.5 million years ago.
So he is younger than the Great Roudný (33 million years old) and older than Venus’s volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
In the process, she threw out a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the base, which by burning it had become red - brown.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption threw out red, brown and red and black touphs in places.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the quarry wall.
In the tubes are noticeable volcanic bombs up to 1 meter large. The second eruption was ended by lava discharge.
At the end of the activity from the volcano flowed lava, which today makes up to 50 m a powerful layer of slag basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate the removal of volcanic ash with lava discharges are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name stratovulkans.
The original volcanic cone was subject to gradual erosion.
However, he was threatened by mining rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tufys were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under pressure from both experts and the public, mining managed to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem, however, is in the porosity and small coherence of rocks that quickly weather, fall apart and slide down the slope.
The quarry is disappearing quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.
The Uhlířský vrch can be reached by green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Slezský Kočov.
Automakers can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the lip alley, where the short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the apartment building.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague residential districts on Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance pay.
Therefore, Ivana quickly sought replacement housing for herself and her then older mother.
From her friends she received a tip on apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the view from the fourth floor of the large forest park and the dam excited me on the other hand," recalls Ivana's first impression.
At first, I thought it'd be a makeshift for, like, three years.
"Today we have been living here for more than 13 years and I would not change not only for a gradual reconstruction," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a 120-meter apartment to a smaller flat with a surface of 62 m2 and distributed almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in pretty good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting doors or changing windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most upset by the impractical and unnecessarily large hallway, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used plasterboard to define individual zones and break down the drywall room, which enabled the new location of the lights.
The first intervention she decided to take after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improving the standard was replacing the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn't know what to do with the bathroom.
For years, I've been taking magazines about living and looking for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
On the recommendation, I contacted young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana claims.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the available hall.
The architect connected the space of the toilet and the bathrooms and two doors with opening wings replaced one sliding, saving the space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, a bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doudárová continued.
Within the framework of the "How to Build a Dream" program, a quick but fundamental change of the living room was carried out, including architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping into the space, which was created by connecting two smaller rooms, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, such as semi-transverses or Japanese walls.
"This would in turn violate the openness and uniformity of space," the architect explains.
The sleeping and the living area were originally separated.
All you had to do was turn your back on two couches and put between them a custom made duvet box.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and painting.
On the kitchen floor and dining area, the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived with a patterned wallpaper.
The kitchenette covers sliding panels with wallpaper if necessary.
The new floor from anti-allergic marmoleum has many advantages compared to the previous laminate: softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of alcoves and ceilings from plasterboard highlighted by color is an example of how you can work with space in the panel.
I left the colors to the architects, I wished it was happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," Ivana says.
The compress from the graphoglass with the motif of a blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
The small apartment managed to store books, among other things, in the space under window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably operated at a distance.
In the renovated interior works excellent contrast of the new with the older, for example with a tens of years old crystal chandelier and quality art objects, which Ivana collects all her life.
The kitchen came last.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took down their numbers and repositioned their deployments.
The furniture in simple design is custom made, the white surface softens the slightly pearly surface.
They fit into a small space thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the whole glass wall tiles above the working board.
Unique graphoglass with digitally printed motif is attractive, moreover it is perfectly maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers to remind her of her favorite neighborhood she lived in for years.
Now she seems to be happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
We united the interior materially and in color and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of everyday items," adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court ruled: Time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former Members of the ODS of Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šnajdr and Petr Tluchor, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until last November, Petr Knötig, spokesperson for the Supreme Court, said.
By this decision, the Court rejected the motion of prosecutor Iva Ištný, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state companies for giving up their mandates and not causing problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, they can continue to prosecute the former Prime Minister who offered them these posts.
He and Vít Barta also arrested an anti-corruption police officer.
Bart's attorney, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of the members of the VV, also did not want to comment on the case, but he said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but I cannot comment on this with regard to the protection of classified facts."
According to information rights the case is solved by the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Barta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case could be related to the case of former police President Petr Lessy, whom he allegedly sought to appoint as Bart.
The latest information rights show, however, that the detention of Vít Barta has nothing to do with Peter Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, spokesperson for the Police Presidium, refused to comment on the fact that the case was dealt with by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," Štěpánka Zenklová told the Public Prosecutor's Office's Law on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there who oversees Bart’s case, and her words thus indirectly indicate that the file or criminal proceedings are kept under cover.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach his wife Vít Bárta Kateřina Klasnovová in the morning before their residence in Prague Klárov.
She was just loading her bags in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement Tomio Okamura commented on Bart’s detention.
According to his words, he has no idea what's going on in the case.
"Welcome to Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was neither a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement Tomia Okamura in the past early elections to the House in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corrupt case of bribery by members of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Then the sentence was changed, and Barta was acquitted.
He slept through: I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospěta, family has always been the first, so at the age of 38, they want to fully submit to it.
Either he gets a job overseas, and he's gonna extend his career, or he's definitely gonna quit hockey.
"I want to play the role of daddy and husband."
"I look forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still in vain for the offer.
Despite being a well-known worker, he never cheats anything.
Despite leaving his heart on the ice every time, he can tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me still is," she says, determinedly.
He may find himself, supposedly wanted by the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season, and also have injured two supporters - the attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like coming to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere has it been delivered that this has really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but I just don't.
You haven't heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes in.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it and the team doesn't walk.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come together to get the contract.
But in New York, that's what happens, isn't it?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are injured, and the team didn't make it to the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that is the reality in which I have to live.
You're leaving for America on Friday, are you expecting something to work?
I've had those expectations since July 5th, when the NHL market opened up with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
Absolutely not. I'm going to Tampa to meet my kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and everything depends on that.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna do the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
On Sunday, Vasik has two hockey games, it is a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in full-time quotes?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 knee-surgery games.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
One day it gets to a point where all the goals, wins, and passes don't make up for what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
No matter what job you have.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have happened to me besides family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, first place - apart from family - is also a sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, sorry, our children - mine and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would love for them to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell each other, in America, there are possibilities in a whole other place.
That's a chance we should offer them.
So are you planning on staying in America permanently?
We're going to practice it like we've done before.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic on Hluboká and in the vicinity of České Budějovice.
And in winter, again in Tampa or wherever our steps lead us.
It's perfect to stay warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it took a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people out there who want to do this so they can choose what they're going to do and how they're going to live.
How long will you have the will to work, train hard at your age, and wait for an offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it's gonna stay there.
You can't plan that.
So you could say you're gonna wait this season to see how it plays out and then decide what to do next?
I'm in the day-to-day phase.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that the construction decision of the 3rd and 4th block of Temelín power plant is postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and approving Contracts of Difference by the government.
These are the reasons that CEZ's current management is trying to pass on its responsibility to the government - i.e. to the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should give a shareholder a recommendation, not hide behind it.
Government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political trade in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
The chairman of the YES admitted this in an interview for the Law that will come out tomorrow.
Business and marketing SkoFIN is led by Abraham
Its competences include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Luděk Šantora in office.
Abraham has linked his professional career to the automotive sector for the past 14 years.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for Alfa Romeo brand and dealer for seven years.
His last assignment was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
SkoFIN was founded in 1992.
Police evacuated a portion of Los Angeles airport for shooting.
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly terminal three.
Reuters Agency, referring to the California media, claims that the lawmen shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, said there was a shootout that injured between two and three members of the Transport Safety Department.
How many people have been injured in total and whether there are any victims but it's still not obvious.
Firefighters are talking about an incident with more injuries.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakiya on Thursday.
With reference to an unnamed US government official, CNN announced it.
Israel’s press widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli army, when asked by CNN, refused to comment on the air raid.
"We do not comment on reports from foreign media," she said.
According to the U.S. government source, the target of the Israeli raid was missiles and related equipment, which the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
AP, referring to another U.S. security officer, informed that the targets of the Israeli raid on Syrian territory were Russian missiles SA-125.
Israel’s second channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area but according to the DPA agency showed a battery of Russian missiles type S-125 Neva.
In addition, they were reported to have seen the batteries of the SA-3 missiles, including the command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to Israel’s television report, the rockets recorded are within 35 kilometers [35 km] and could carry 70 kilograms [70 kg] weight warheads.
Israel reportedly bombed missile supplies inside Syria at least twice this year, reported CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to intervene in any supply of weapons designated by Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated the estimate of annual profits and expects record profits from vacationers in Australia and Great Britain.
The Agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to be between USD 325 and 340 million, compared to USD 305 to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12- to 17-percent increase in relation to record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year, and the second half began with a sharp growth mainly in Australian and British trips away from business trips.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards a record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This is where Australia and the United Kingdom belong, which are traditionally our greatest profit makers.
During the second half of Australia, the recreational activity business recovered, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
America’s trade has recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year, and is expected to yield a year’s profit for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20.
Activists of Greenpeace detained in Russia have been transported to St Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September due to a protest against planned oil extraction in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St Petersburg.
AFP informed about this today, referring to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the original charges against her pirates have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women, detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil rig, were transported from the Murmansk Correctional Facility to the St Petersburg prison," the organization announced.
The reasons for the relocation of detainees are unclear; according to the DPA, this was a planned transfer.
The environmental authorities first accused them of piracy, for which they were facing up to 15 years in prison in the event of a conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would be replaced by a milder disorderly conduct, for which there is a lower sentence with a maximum of seven years in prison.
Greenpeace, however, pointed out in today's statement that the charges of piracy have not yet been dropped by the authorities, as they promised.
They say that means the arrests are now being charged with two counts of crime.
Last week, the mighty Committee of Investigation announced that the charge of piracy would be replaced by a riot charge.
But when 30 prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, new charges have been brought against everyone," AFP quoted from Greenpeace's statement.
In mid-September, the Russians arrested three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom's oil platform.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they've all been held in custody, against whom they have filed an appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
Ecologists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
According to AFP, the CEO of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo said today that moving to St Petersburg will facilitate meetings with families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They may actually be worse," he pointed out.
Dutch King Willem-Alexandro was asked for help by one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch was invited to discuss their situation at a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In it it claims that Maliki has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly part of the struggles in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one of Shakespeare's 19th-century novels, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied in English literature.
The test will also include a ‘hidden text’ to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a language exam and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should publish a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
Other major subjects are expected to change next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, who oversees graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus in terms of whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain society’s trust” and that we need to insist that the graduation test be “a more demanding, ambitious and more stringent”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
To compare schools in Australia, they spend an average of 143 hours a year in mathematics and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive math exam – along with more emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards – will probably encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “real world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-smelling dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD was fully lit up.
Everything culminated when Mayor Petr Kajnar turned to the court for undemocratic nominations.
However, the actors of the case did not want to express themselves too much about this, so that the party would not be harmed even more before the elections.
But now the votes of the voters are numbered.
The management of the Ostrava ČSSD immediately on Monday evening called on the Mayor of Ostrava to step aside, and he will probably push to lose his job.
But Peter Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What is involved in disputes and who is on whose side he described in an exclusive interview for Diary.
How do you feel about the outcome of the election?
The ČSSD certainly expected a much better result.
Was it damaging to us that before the elections, media disputes within the party were dealt with?
I imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now in.
It's a party that has its internal problems, it's internally ill, and people feel that it's not all right.
They made it very clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
I think ODS has been going through decline for some time now and, unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people, who had previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, moved to the people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.
It has to do with the fact that the authorities of Ostrava's Magistrate go around collecting computers.
This shows that the ČSSD is not just composed of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think of their own.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haskovci and Sobotkaci.
But that too has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a sign of what is happening now in Prague.
Haškov's wing gradually occupied its positions so that, after the election, it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
A person is in a political situation where sometimes he has to accept compromises.
But everyone has an internal line where they can't compromise anymore, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run for House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotka's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Haskov's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you taking Bohuslav Sobotka's side and not Michal Hasek's?
In my opinion, Sobotka is a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and to some extent about visions for the party and for this country.
I'll admit I didn't hear anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can begin to call off the party's chairman.
This is a power struggle, regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, what Michal Hasek did in Prague now ended his political career.
How you felt that the Ostrava ČSSD leadership did not approve you for the candidate.
Political parties are based on a competition to see who will be placed from among their members.
The competition should be based mostly on program visions and the ability of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have powers or visions are also reporting to this competition, but for them, the political party is an elevator to money that they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to come to the fore because they break the rules without scruples, they break the party's statutes.
By their practices they make the political parties mafia and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether there is a political future for Kajinar.
It is important that the parties respect the statutes.
Therefore, before the elections, you filed a motion for a preliminary action against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by the fact that organizations that do not comply with it can cancel, purposely establish new organizations, gradually throwing out uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarík from the council club, but he filed a lawsuit against it and then they cancelled the order to expel him.
This shows that seeking to comply with the party's statutes through the courts is the last option, but at the time that the other ways and control authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to function, this is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD led by Adam Rykala is to remove you from your position as mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruba Lumír Palyza is interested in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they gain votes, and then they strengthen their power in the party for the votes.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the purchase of Bazala Stadium was an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me as a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
In doing so, the city bought assets that are strategically valuable to it.
So how do you feel about your remaining as mayor?
The District Committee has already asked me and other people on Monday to consider our stay at the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Catch the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy initiating and promoting, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so much development, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a scientific and technological park.
Yet everything is becoming uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than in the way of getting in the way of the places they want.
Will you still fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is going to work well, then political parties have to work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to manage the state effectively if they can't even control themselves.
So I'm not thinking about leaving the ČSSD now, because I think that whoever's causing cancer on this side is not me, but these people are trying to scare me out.
Olomouc will open in the historical centre of the public rink
The organizer of Olomouc's Christmas markets and winter skating, Pavel Spaný, said that the preparatory work on the rink was started on October 26th and the ice production aggregate has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
The skaters and passersby will also have two punch stands.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire surface of the podium is covered so that the skaters can comfortably change," he described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the coming Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall in Horní náměstí to repair the Dolní náměstí.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of summer, so the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right outside the town hall in 2009, when the rink was open from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched on the Upper Square one month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín will be remedied by the Regional Court
The Regional Court acquitted 25-year-old Slovak and 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the guilt.
They're looking at 15 to 20 years in prison or even a special sentence.
Spokesperson Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court annulled the regional decision and returned the matter to him again for consideration.
He refused to comment on the grounds that the judge had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the prosecution, the young men attacked a 75-year-old man in his home.
Senior died an agonizing death.
According to the prosecution, the men strangled him, beat him, and kicked him all over the body with a metal object, probably with a gas gun, planted about three dozen shots in the head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures to the cranial bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding to the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
Young people allegedly took some 3000 crowns and jewelry worth some 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only indirect evidence against the defendants' scents, which the expert considered not to be fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
The scent traces from the crime scene and other items were consistent with the defendants in more than ten cases, but the police initially treated them as factual and not odorous clues.
In addition, there was some error in handling them.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
Neither did the emergency services doctor on call alert for violent deaths.
So it was only after a few days that CSIs contacted the seminal physicians who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with any trace of the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
No DNA was found on the scene of the defendants.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths responsible for robbery of the jewelry store.
Robbery took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of senior in Slopný.
Younger accused of murdering a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
The reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo at the beginning of November.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will perform the reconstruction of the lawn.
Reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week of the Fall Strings
Saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will dot next Wednesday for the 18th Annual Strings of Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 at the Lucerna Grand Hall together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will join with the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia led by Martin Kumžák.
In Shorter's editing for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert in the Autumn Strings will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
The list of performers he worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he met Czech musician Miroslav Vituš and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade indicated the direction of a new style of fusion.
He's been performing with Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past 13 years.
Some afterparty after the festival will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on 9th November at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the local audience will be presented with the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which will bring the electro-jazz form Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The ladies say they forbid UEFA to publish sentences for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chair of the panel of judges of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing sentences for the judges.
The UEFA rules forbid her, which she said in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, the FACR would be threatened with a penalty.
Damková also refused to take sides in her role with the footballers Pilsen, where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1:6," said Damková in response to the criticism that has been raging since Plzeň recently played twice as much penalty as the other league teams.
Thus, although in recent months the FACR has stopped publishing sentences for referees, Damková assures that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the referee has made a mistake, they will limit his delegation, whatever the match was," Damková said.
The reason why penalties are not published is, according to Damek, a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and punishes the breach harshly."
"We're very suspicious here, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop this, there will be severe sanctions," said Damková.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really special," she added.
If it continues to publish information, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not be filling the program to raise referees," added Damková.
The arrest of Barta is related to Janousek and Bemus: Is he behind the leak of the wiretaps?
On Thursday, police arrested the Chairman of the Public Affairs of Vít Bárta.
Along with him was arrested also the head of the Department of Analysts and Informatics Anti-corruption Police Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bem (ODS).
News server.cz confirmed the information about the reports, with which news server News.cz confirmed the Czech Press Office's reliable source.
The wiretaps of Janoušek and Bema, published last March by the daily Mladá Fronta Dnes, in which both men call each other "Mazánek" and "Hummingbird", show Janoušek's influence on the steps of the city under Béma's leadership.
The journal then stated that it was acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later it escaped to the ABL Security Agency.
Bart owned that one back then.
News server News.cz pointed out that the detained criminalist Petržílek worked for BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently involved in the wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can't confirm anything or say anything at all," said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was supervising the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the approaching effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act as of 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the companies’ representatives questioned said that they had not dealt with matters related to the two key codes in their society at all.
This is reflected in the survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the views of 108 Czech companies.
In connection with the approaching deadline for the effectiveness of the two key codes, it is only at the last moment that a number of managers are beginning to realize how much they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the laination of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether revolutionary changes will eventually take place or not.
"Now they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to new law for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of the companies intensively engaged in the new codes, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of the companies in this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, every fifth company has not yet dealt with recodification, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that the issues of recodification have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is for the largest number of companies questioned by the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), followed by a solution to business conditions (16 per cent) and changes in the cadastre of real estate and liability for damage (after 10 per cent).
One of the most important news of the whole recodification will take place in contracts, namely unifying the contract regulation only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will cease, which should make contract law clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom of relationship arrangement," added attorney Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddán.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
In addition, the topics relating to the changes in the assembly and the course of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent) follow.
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially when a company threatens to default or becomes involved.
"In practice this means that if board members and executives do not act with the care of a proper economy and do not avert the imminent decline of the company, they may lose the benefits gained for the performance of their duties for the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier's style develop as a living language

Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care free of charge
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team will treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in the West African countries; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 leading candidates for CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other ten main candidates in the CNN award competition of the Year 2013.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle has watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital city of Cameroon in 1981.
At first, he was treated with only a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he developed a hematoma that caused him problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals where he received such a treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to get there first, but you're not first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon per 5,000 inhabitants.
Just to compare, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could visit the Cameroonian physician, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the cost of health care in that country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy life with poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor of a vascular surgeon at a central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded ASCOVIME, a nonprofit organization whose members visit rural areas on weekends where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush into vans, attach themselves to the roofs of medical supplies and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodations the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his broad smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in local entertainment.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or birth certificate for free – a document that the school demands, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
The team is doing simple surgery under local anesthesia tonight.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, in a town hall or at home; after surgery, the patient wakes up and goes to a recovery site to give room to another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and hygienic equipment Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay awake and continue working, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
A man said that after hernia surgery, he would be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says it is this second job that finances about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteers for Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We thoroughly washed our hands and removed blood stains or held his instruments," says O'Malley.
You'll never experience that as a second-year med student in America.
Students volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive at Yaounde, food, transportation and study are provided by Bwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
Bwelle's constant struggle is not a burden.
Helping others live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Take a look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát renewed the position of Head Sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 000.
"I consider it essential for this function to be clearly defined and formalised, so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses, and I think he deserves to be given proper attention by the Ministry.
It takes not only high professionalism but also human attitude and personal convictions in the pursuit of this profession.
"I will gladly and with all responsibility try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who are not helping us with their approach to patients to carry out their calling with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the public's eyes," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová also stated on the occasion of her entry into office that she wants to deal with various aspects of the job position of a nurse and intends to cooperate among others with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I do not want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary I see them standing side by side, each having their own responsibilities and, together with other health professionals, forming a team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of sisters, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks are unnecessarily burdened by nurses and are taking up the time they could and should spend on patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve cooperation in the team and with health service providers’ management, adaptation of competences, as well as labour law issues, such as compliance with the Labour Code or non-burdening nurses with their insufficient number at the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous homesicknesses, which, for fear of possible sanctions, are not documented in a specific case where violations of the rules might occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the function of the Czech Head Nurse could serve as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and having the competent authorities examine the particular case," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nursery (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursing - pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been Head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-Doctors and Recognition of Qualification at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education and Science.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at a bedside in the internal department, and also worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the main sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She's not a member of any political party.
♪ So I don't choke on hate ♪
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, the present.
The number of pages comparable to his most famous work in Houstina (Petrov, 2001) suggests that this is not a thin volume.
For Salon Kahuda, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't choke on hate.
To see new and new clones of this foolish human pettyness, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavors.
I'm not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by powerless lust, the ecclesiastical soul, and the opposite-spoiling ideologists who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a small selling whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of my life on this planet.
I like to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamphouse tonight.
You're talking about feeling wasted, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The break occurred a long time ago, about ten years old.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, that's what I lived for.
There's still a quiet boy in there.
I see other lone trainers, everyone in my tornado of anxiety.
I was saved from writing books.
I'm participating in this giant, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The vast, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is a direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when the way of trial-a mistake arises another generation of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artistic intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self - speaking, or, rather, a dialogue that is conducted by the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
As the periods of peace are crossed by silently sleeping metastases of wars, which may one day wake up - my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the silent avalanche of my life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day, it'll quietly drown me.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and lays down to layers that are stored in the darkness "below the surface of consciousness".
The neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient year-rounds of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law within me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to ego metaphorically - can you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrical connections all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to an ever-changing presence, trying to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there's overload disorder.
Analogically - as if you had dropped a PC, from a speech emulator and translator program from foreign languages, you would get confused first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few failed restarts ended in a dark green flashing Bios screen, in a basic system that controls functions and cooperation on a motherboard, between processor and operating memory, etc.
For someone who has not yet understood what we're talking about, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
Do you mention her often - why are you regularly interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling, and behavior - a breach appears.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "So long he gazed into the abyss, until the abyss looked into it."
A pure feeling - that man is lost, if all hope disappears, mentally "died" and a new quality begins.
And why am I interested in this in person?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once one fell into the pool and drowned, days, months and years ran, he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him how to swim - to live.
He's become a diver.
Perhaps a sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal's lyrics once did to me.
To what extent do you think about the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
The one about whom nothing meaningful can be said, one calls it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best described by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine Captain Nemo, ran on the Stindles in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branching of the authors and their messages, it reads: "The sun of the bright worlds of other Karl Hynek Macha".
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On a retro-reflection that gets to you through people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life choices.
Books are actually "life" or rather "worlds".
They're coded into letters, bearing experience, the history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them to life, let their sentences flow to the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - waking up more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is placed in the lines - according to old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, as it usually is, a chain of authorial readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like to read.
Will you be happy to do it again, or do you feel differently after years?
Today, I prefer to tell stories.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they're inconspicuous, they don't draw attention to each other, they have friendly radiations, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give you an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived was (and I hope he is still alive) one curly bookshop (it's called conveniently Červenka), a cheerful fellow and a good girl's bull.
In one drinker, he introduced me to the individual articles of the string of readers of my book, Houstina.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a crushed, read copy of my book.
In embarrassment, I put away the newly read morning and wept briefly malely.
We all stood there silently, wriggling and crying drunkly with emotion.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't stand it, and with a scream he jumped head-on out the window into a snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night country, and they were happy with the rabies of the sensitive, sore souls of the compatriots and the sadness of the lost patriots - howled and pampered like werewolves until morning.
Each one of your books is formally and materially different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, darkness, present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts the words of an old Russian myth in the mouth of the folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog, a gray chest on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
We may have been devils in hell a long time ago, drawing lots - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it back to the free influx of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depths and in such a breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so, of course, we do exactly in the depths of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with influx of dopamine, mixtures of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes it becomes a disorder and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves humans.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the ocean coast unconscious and in a leaky sail made of a dirty handkerchief catching the tides of the soft wind.
I have to write to be human.
Obama is retreating from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama withdrew from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With hundreds of thousands of reports of statements from the Republicans' providers in recent days, the President has been accused of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama flinched from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called "disturbing in the media" about statements, Obama called on the Americans who received these announcements to look for new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive healthcare program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
Its administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the people who have purchased insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Available Care Act.
"I am telling these Americans straight: you deserve better," said Sebelius in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Available Care Act, said that the launch of the Internet market has been “unfavorable” since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
Irritating Sebelius said this sentence, which was captured by the microphone, yesterday towards a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee meeting, which took place after a turbulent exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was concerned about whether she herself had to participate in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly wondered why the “architect” of the Available Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and he did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
What billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the meeting, and according to various sources from the agencies and from backstage, they said that they are already in hand.
The transaction notice should come in November, probably before the start of the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, the LTE frequency auction was launched.
And to the general surprise, until then, the company's taste in telecommunications was not discussed.
But Sazek is now led by a very experienced telecom boy Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing director of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and last time he ran the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to transfer existing customers to his network from his own virtual operator.
I don't think Vodafone would normally like that, but according to Hospodářské noviny, this could be part of a much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender on the LTE network (as a rookie can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone may not be auctioned at all, or he will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Saza.
Vodafone will release Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In between, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend the saved money on a fixed Internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech) to acquire an immediately full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But, on the other hand, it's a big pier waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would have won the LTE network under O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
From next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech Television ever be able to do without signing events?
As President Zeman’s era was entered by a legendary ashtray scene, it is not difficult to hear complaints that collect evidence of the castle club’s perpetuating.
In the past, no one has documented the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík, much less to sign it.
That's right, the editors stood up for management.
However, the cases described do not answer the question as to where some journalists are coming from - whether this is a direct order response or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathy.
And since we assume general depravity, we cannot forgive ourselves for the question of whether changing the conditions on television is not sought by other, no less unscrupulous, power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth is that in developed countries, those who say that there are no good attempts to intervene politicians in broadcasting.
However, the truth is also that this does not mean that complaints about public media do not exist.
Complainers do not question their independence.
On the other hand, they criticize what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this situation is not there.
But even in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories of evil politicians and good journalists may be more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of the inconceivable situation in which many imperfect human beings come upon themselves.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of power
It is almost a rule that, at the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to fulfil its national obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential term and events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the Air Force could have flown across the border, heavy weapons could have been destroyed, and the government could have fled to London right away and not fought hard for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, the nation wouldn't still be hungover from that surrender.
Benes was not a statesman, and he was still in shape during Munich, but during the war it started to go downhill and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
If he was any better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Ho.
He was elected "the President will not be in a position to make decisions".
But he had to, although the big decision with the knife on his neck at Hitler's chancellorship probably wasn't.
František Moravec, Chief of Intelligence, told the Germans, until the last days of March 1939, what should be done so that the occupation, which he knew exactly about for the day, did not go so smoothly and with such a gain.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, and they didn't believe him, and they were afraid.
The human ruin of Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow had commanded him.
Ludvík Svoboda definitely made it impossible to participate in normalization and had to depose him, already senile.
That Husák was helpless and sick depressive old man things in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only positive thing.
Havel was lucky not to meet him in office in the last few years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his actions make him realize that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now here's this.
Head of State and Chief of Armed Forces looks what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic right now.
Or maybe it's a threat, just not to be seen.
Then the question is, exceptionally, whether it is not (in historical terms) good that the President is not fully strong.
It's not normal, though.
Couldn't we have elected a president in this country once again with an acceptable thinking and acceptable health?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasy of extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophone player Wayne Shorter would throw lightly.
In the conception of his quartet, which will culminate in this year's Strings of Autumn festival on 6 November in the large hall of Prague Lucerna, everything is related to everything.
The partitura of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber matter and have to think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, of the newly 80-year-old Shorter - extraordinary composer, bearer of nine Grammys, former teammate of Miles Davis and probably the biggest living jazz saxophonist today - does not like to explain.
He does not talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I found it best to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then are disappointed when things turn out differently," Shorter says.
How Insects From Thailand Raised the Sales of the Paris Bar
You may sneer at insects, yet you have no idea that you will eat about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and a unique experience you also have taken care of.
He placed the insect offer first in Paris on the menu of his business at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, the cook and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, would be found in a fashionable 18th district near Montmartre, a widely visited tourist.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can eat not only various larvae, locusts or water beetles, even scorpions can taste here.
Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (in order to avoid damage to the insect’s wings, do not touch the legs or do not damage the eyes) send Davirons all the way from Thailand.
Europe is still learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneer menu gives several reasons why to consume insects.
The first is an ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (as regards finances, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron said to Reuters Station.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes the pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just passing on a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would be thrilled by the idea of eating a beetle decorated with pesto, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to served insects are very positive according to the owner.
Even skeptics are said to eventually taste, even if they begin with the smallest bites and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these degustation plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the state's interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, following the implementation of the measure, save substantial amounts for heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of state fiscal policy, there are significant leverage and multiplier effects, and it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore strongly disagrees with the Government resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps as would enable further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be announced within it.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
President Miloš Zeman left Motol Hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lány.
What kind of condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the US defense stance on his surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented confession, he said that in some cases espionage “has gone too far. ”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for treating the NSA's espionage revelations, which appeared thanks to informant Edward Snowden, as an autopilot.
The published information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, through a video-link to an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that both the president and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have been happening since the possibility was, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, September 11.”
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but he emphasized that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far. ”
And the President is determined to try to explain it to people and to clarify it, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA organization strive for good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are struggling with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to murder and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings from blowing up, and people from being executed, because we already know about these plans in advance.
On Thursday, the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that US legislators are going to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged US espionage and convinced Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other people this week and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disillusioned by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
It is really important for the US's national security interests that Europe stays on board with us, in view of its joint efforts to combat terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue working together to combat terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
News in the media that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstood metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States,
Another revelation quoted Snowden’s documents that NSA was tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone and 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended allied espionage as necessary and said it was both sides of the matter.
In the midst of the turmoil Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and he hopes that members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to engage are to be published.
He said the program was still working.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the trip was to help correct relationships, he added that “good-meaning educational measures” would be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have been using for years.
"While we modify our monitoring programs to better protect European rights, they must also recognize the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland as scheduled this weekend to respond to the hostility triggered by the US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
Aussies appealed to stay in Thai prison
A 21 - year - old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days ’ imprisonment on Phuket Island, falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with perjury on the island of Phuket on June 15 when she told the Thai police that a taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, had attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, the record of the industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket Island police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low security facility on the periphery in Phuket instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked for help from the State Department in Canberra in his daughter's case.
Tunks told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about her daughter’s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is definitely a difficult time, but we hope that it will return to us safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
In the meantime, reports from Australia reported that she had spent her vacation in the Krabi recreation area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in an adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct the damaged image for tourists, which may have been behind the liberating verdict.
The jag joke was, "Breaker goal"?
He got a puck in the defense zone, and no one caught him.
In addition, the escape changed after a quick forhend loop.
Jaromír Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night 119. winning goal in the NHL commented on Facebook social network.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svoboda heard from the Czech Railways Director and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" he wrote at the introduction with the exaggeration Jagr.
I hear we're a lot alike.
I guess I'll have to quit night training so I don't go any faster.
"I am afraid that the Minister of Defence will be able to contact us later and would like to advertise the jets!" he added emojis.
In addition, New Jersey has won a second victory in a row.
"And most importantly, you have noticed - Marie Rottrov's treatment is working," said Jagr.
Place of post-election tenderloin after-election goulash
The October elections rather than the winners brought a lot of losers.
It is not only the parties that have not even reached the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. the SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of its internal split.
Politicians served us a post-election goulash on the weekend instead of a holiday candle.
Andrej Babiš, who promised voters to change the political style of governance.
The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and the division in the winning party record the political (from)will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even vote for the party that President Zeman publicly supported in the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the President has lost his strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, there are still several ways to win him back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While ČSSD's chances of getting a Prime Minister in my eyes are getting further away, Andrei Babiš's businessmen are getting closer.
The post-election development is still a mile away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD government supported by communists, this development is better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Due to the loud resistance of YES to get together with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant of the coalition ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 Members) is still available.
Due to the division in the ČSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations can be rather depressing for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD, consisting of "nezemany" in the Castle, will probably not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfying ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further divisions in the party.
So I ask myself, "Is there no way we're going to succeed in the next early election?"
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the ANO electoral mandate.
The ČSSD plans for introducing sectoral taxes, increasing income taxes more significantly or building a state bank have hopefully fallen below the table.
On the contrary, the parties to the ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Dawn agree, for example, to promote entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (the government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The friction surfaces are the most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
YES now has the upper hand, so the program so far most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean more to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that is still moving in the economy.
