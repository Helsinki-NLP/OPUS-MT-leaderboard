Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal a section within the framework of the amendment to the Penal Code on the basis of which the opposition leader Julius Tymoshenko was convicted.
At the second reading of the motion to mitigate the penalties for economic offenses, Members rejected the adjustment that would open the way to the liberation of the imprisoned explorer.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in October for the conclusion of an allegedly disadvantageous contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not final, the appeal sentenced is to be discussed by the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the verdict the political vendetta of the regime, the suspicion of bias of the court has triggered a trial in the West.
The proposal to exclude Section 365 from the penal code, on the basis of which the examiner was convicted, supported 147 Members in the vote.
It took 226 votes to approve it.
Libya’s Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
We have to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the election, but it is whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up for sharia law, and we already have an idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, for stealing is a hand cut.
Women can forget emancipation, possible apostates from the faith awaiting execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There'll be order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly wouldn't want.
But our way of life is not the only one or objectively best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans mentioned for a change.
In fact, it is a wonder that Islamic warriors have taken credit for helping unbelieving dogs.
They are only excused that from their point of view, NATO air raids were not directed by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness was celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We participated in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militarily occupy Libya.
Thus, the local problem of expelling the Crusaders is eliminated.
But without the occupation of an oil company, will they have Libyan black gold for a kiss?
Perhaps they will not, and the West will finally be able to boast the selfless protection of human rights.
Unless it spoils the Sharia law enforcement.
A new era of crisis is about to begin.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
The statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated interquartally, Germany and France are growing.
But today the bond market is breaking records.
Investors no longer look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5% expected, France increased by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better than expected (increased by 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), while France stated that it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1.5% year on year in this third quarter.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated on a quarterly basis, confirming the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance, according to the Czech Statistical Office.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
Most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year on year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated intermittently.
The German economy increased by 0.5 percent in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonally translated data.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with analyst expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year on year.
The yield on her 10-year-old bonds is at 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields for Czech 10-year-old bonds are below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
From Germany, there are voices that the ECB should be the lender of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate the 200 million advance
Football team has done the hardest job of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goal Petr Jiráček won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a great portion of luck in the second half, saved a luxurious lead from home rematch and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched a progressive match in a detailed reportage.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
Czech representation also thanks to domestic loss in the end, great Czech and hero Jiráček won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrates the advance to the European Championship.
Because of the precise defence of the Czech whole, the blackhorns did not get into pressure until the second half.
The losers of the match became Damjanovich and Vukinič, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech team will not miss the European Championships next year, and the prize will be about CZK 200 million.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hard to join in the combination and played mostly around the half line.
The pressure of domestic footballers also did not come in the first half, because long kicks for defense were precisely averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a living shield.
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
In their gestures, they want to express support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday, at noon, students prayed before the object and then cried out the death of the US and Israel.
On Tuesday, several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a living shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre, where uranium is being processed.
They thus show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that Iran did not seem to have ceased its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
The possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
At noon, students prayed before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then proclaimed the death of America and Israel.
In the case of an attack intended to paralyze Iran’s nuclear programme as much as possible, the Israeli press said that, in addition to the Isfahan Centre, the target would also be the Natanz facility in which uranium is enriched.
Obese kid's menu: doesn't eat sausages and dinners
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of schoolchildren overweight and 5 percent of obese children.
Obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Once again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which he grows up and the patterns that he is surrounded by.
In obese children, for example, sausages appear up to half as often as in families with normal weight.
Fried fries had for dinner the day before the research related to an education event called Obesity is not a coincidence of more than 19 percent obese.
It is also not customary for fat families to play sports, but this applies to most of the families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children replied that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of Obesity is not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from the 4th to 8th classes have been involved in the project.
The proper diet and exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obesity children.
"Only half of the respondents, for example, said that they eat five times a day in the breakfast-dinner-dinner-dinner mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition," one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no sausage at night
Experts point out that there are important and relative details for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast time.
At the same time, only 23 percent of schoolchildren’ families eat breakfast in the Czech Republic.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding out that a tenth of the households don't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed regularly play sports, the result was less than half - 15 percent for their parents.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own menus from the offered options according to their own tastes and their own opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
There are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes among their favorite dishes.
"It is particularly alarming that sweet lemonade is popular," says the final report on the survey.
For lunch as a main dish, pasta was just over the poultry.
However, the children practically did not want legumes at all and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetables is low.
Adhesive to Health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"There was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition in many cases in the control group of survey participants who filled out the questionnaire after the end of the Obesity education lecture," the project said.
For example, sweet lemonade, where more children would have preferred ordinary water.
Children have also checked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day more frequently in the questionnaire and would limit sweet meals and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, asserting pros
In the opening article about how stylists learn, I kind of complained that there was already a lot at the opening hours.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures of three professionals in the field, dress up problematic characters and seminar on how it works on the set.
And it gets worse.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "peded".
This time we discussed with director Alice (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's a boy figure with no proper curves, and someone's overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the required curves.
We were given tips, as for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, to nicely emphasize the figure and at the same time not to dress the woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirts or trousers do not really fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece made to measure.
You won't regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, sums up, stays in the waist and so on.
The boy figure can afford to wear clothes with lashes, applications, embroidery or pick-up.
Of course, there are many such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given the homework assignment, it's a lot to take in.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to design two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and type of character.
I'll be "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In the spirit of exultation, for me personally definitely better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about 100 kilos (please consider exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of magazines or search them on the Internet and print them and then process them graphically.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, such as trends in handbags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Stoneman told us about.
But it's not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture was filled with information about character types and three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, such a short (or if you want to wear a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt like a cape, but you can also dress it on a bare body, put on boats and take pictures like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But I most appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly to work."
"Then you can begin to break them," said Jakub.
So I can finally see why we're crushing ourselves with all the instruction, what to combine with, why, when we see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have a lot more clothes prepared than he can take.
So for a fashion story that's going to have ten pages (that's ten outfits), I have to be ready to cover up at least 15.
And also that the picture of the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
So that's what we have to count on when we're creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed that the image and style often does up to half the success.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I know something, the way I look is secondary).
And if someone is already letting us create styling, then we have to assume that they will probably dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than they really have.
Then all we have to do is google and see if the tabloids had written about the fact that the celebrity had grown fat and lost weight and so on.
On Sunday both Honza and Mario put their hearts to us that the stylist is not enough to navigate in fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not encourage people, stand by your opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to sort out her wardrobe and fill it up with nice pieces, you can't just throw out the whole closet and tell her, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things to praise and recommend what they can be worn for," Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "powder", or bag, must contain.
It's the one you turn around your waist and you have all the propriety you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair rollers or safety pins, there are also silon threads (with which the stylist helps in photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips by which we fasten the back of the clothes, if it is larger (spin or other clamps are not allowed, they would destroy the clothing), or a sewing machine.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something out, we learned how to fit our shoes properly.
Even in a photo shoot in an studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the shoes with our scissors, so they don't accidentally get damaged.
So it takes real skill.
Mario pleased me when he commended my creation without reservation.
The skill mentioned is not really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard on the second weekend of the course.
I'm getting more and more clear that it's not really a walk in the park, no matter what anyone says.
In Need for Speed: The Run is racing across America.
Review
Originally a carefree ride turns into a routine morning shift because of a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
Ambition was largely successful, but it is of no use when no one seemed to want to do anything extra.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run had raised high expectations before the release.
He promised that the old race series Need for Speed would once again move a bit in a new direction and from playable demonstrations he appeared as a game that might not be in the genre of action racing just to number.
We were also wondering how the inserted passages would end up, in which the main hero would get out of the car and run on his own.
However, as is the custom of the NFS series, many are a little different in outcome than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more or less years.
So they're not actually mistakes, but rather an expression of some kind of incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal issues and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco, and your job is to be the first to arrive in New York.
The idea brings with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't get the feeling that the game is always the same.
Some of the environments are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a world-class thing.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seems visually very pleasant.
Moreover, from time to time races are enhanced by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to be buried by avalanches.
In addition, individual races are quite well set in succession.
There's only a few types, but that's enough.
For a while you are trying to overtake the desired number of opponents (actually classic race), then you are catching up again (classical fight with stopwatches) and then there is a duel waiting for you with only one opponent.
From time to time, the police will also get involved in this, which makes your efforts even more difficult.
The news is the passages outside the car.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it will surprise you that these passages are in play much less than you would expect (in particular maybe only three).
In the end, it is for the benefit of the thing, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying, and in the context of the above mentioned, it ranks among the elements that augment the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is definitely no longer a big deal nowadays, but it cannot be said to be a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the driving model is still quite well suited for the more active racing, although we could find better for the competition.
So far, everything is in perfect order.
But the problems are beginning to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer in order.
We do not expect this type of game to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave, then everything is probably not all right.
Typically, when you drive over or pass cars in normal traffic, you can easily lick each other, but sometimes in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even flat out.
Thanks to the reboot system, it doesn't matter, but it will upset you reliably.
Restarts are designed so that if you smash or drive far off track, the game will throw you back to the last clue point on the track.
But there are only five reboots available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool in case something goes wrong than you can rely on it.
Sometimes even restarts don't help, they'll solve it until the need to learn a given section of the race by heart.
The big flaw in the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply can't fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the same place, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It pisses off especially in situations where you can see the opponent passing between two opposite cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get there, because it's "counted" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
In all the time playing you will find several places where you, again regardless of the time, always overtake the same opponent in the same place.
It hits the most at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get there in front of you at any cost, apparently.
When you drive in front of you, you get a worse view of the cars, so at first, you're probably going to get a lot of smashing.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and more adrenalineier, but the design is so obvious that it will make you reliably quickly disgusted.
And it's a shame, because even with a simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes so actionable that sometimes you can't literally keep track of what's going on.
And it doesn't really matter whether the concept of 50 unique tracks, the race sequence, is responsible, so that boredom doesn't stand a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to switch cars during races.
You have to watch out for gas stations near the roads, because that's where you can change the car, although in most cases you can get by with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars on straight motorways and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and mode of challenges, which are races in individual locations, which you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common for both challenges and story.
Various items are unlocked for the higher level of the driver: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also linked to the online Autolog function, which compares, among other things, your achievements with other players and provides other community functions.
One other difficult to understand is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you can get to the subway tunnel (but be it), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (but be it).
On the tachometer, the numbers are flashing between 150 and 200 km/h (let's be) and in that direction, a train of subways comes crashing in the back and scrapes you uncompromisingly.
At the editor's office, we can probably spend a few more days discussing whether we really didn't think a little bit about the game, or whether the authors think we're really that big of an idiot.
The technical aspect of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It is so saddened that in some of the tenser moments the images are falling, in some cases rather tragically.
However, this concerns mainly accidents with more participants, where continuous imaging would be no longer of any use to you.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of younger audiences, a soundtrack from the "every dog different village" category was created, but it is possible to assume that someone will not just buy the game because of listening to music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of the NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game looks unfinished.
I'm sure it's fun, but get ready for mistakes to rub you in the eye with the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously disrupted the balance between institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down a bit, and for all players to get used to their new roles," the Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
As much as she takes her motto "clearly and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she was able to describe the various EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"First there was a criticism that he was bland, that he was a gray official, that he couldn't perform any role, and I have to say that everyone was blown away, that he performed the role well."
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 Member States, communicate with them well, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in response to the question: 'Who is this European Union? Which phone number should I call?', as an important step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to stop us from having fun.
Vice-President has also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency last year called it a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The collapse of the government at this time was marked as a major negative that severely damaged the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the 'fact' was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is being resolved to this day.
Moreover, a new seven-year budget of the Union still needs to be approved, which is precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less, is all on the agenda for future negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: 'A Europe of clarity'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, lingo that no one understands.
How is a citizen to understand that in Brussels, there really are no curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different size or that we really need to be banned by someone."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We've got a multi-speed Europe waiting for us.
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than positive aspects of the matter.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian comes to me and the Slovak comes to me, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what's your Visegrad Four?" and doesn't look happy about it at all."
In the future, the Union, according to Viceno, is expected mainly by the new hard rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
The concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European Federation" is perceived as very real.
"We have euro area countries and non-euro area countries."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that they wanted and those that they didn't want should cooperate."
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues that have an impact on the whole Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
The IBM Innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that would best express IBM's strategy, the closest would be "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been established for a hundred years.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already struck a password that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became a print around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began to be published in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business, and society during our first centuries.
We hope that we can achieve even more in the second hundred," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director for the anniversary.
Worked-up system
Watson treated his employees in the 1930s, like the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - people from IBM were one of the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the employer, plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system to pay for the best inventors and traders.
The IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company was brilliant at extracting talent from the beginning - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so she could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, headed by IBM next year, will be replaced by Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and has been the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called yams, online brainstorming, which have resulted in many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there's enough ideas - almost half a million people work at the firm.
Institutions with a good name
Its strong internal and external image ensures a firm position in the business.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for the use of technology," said George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is known in the United States because of its logo - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
IBM with roughly $220 billion this year became the second largest technology company according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first outstood Microsoft since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations have hit the customer's taste and times - IBM for example failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally cling to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they don't work, leave them.
Unlike a competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s sales are mostly serviced, and after about a fifth they are made up of software and hardware.
In 1990 he was the most powerful hardware representative with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies during the same period.
It has continued to invest since 2008 when the modern financial crisis swept through the world for the first time.
IBM is acting on the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM has not been affected by the current crisis.
The IBM stock price has increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, while the company’s net profit continues to increase.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything but its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it.
History of IBM: From Cheese Slicer to Flight to Space
IBM (International Business Machines) was established in New York a hundred years ago, originally with a complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken over only in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s, gave the basis for the later IBM.
They owned technologies such as famous "fuckers", i.e. hours recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over the supervisory board of the company until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, head of a rival company, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas still have an unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started producing and selling all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years that Watson was in charge of the company, the turnover doubled to $9 million and the company's extensive expansion began to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the firm that after nearly 40 years in the boss's chair, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, replaced him.
Under his leadership IBM began to develop artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "basket", which established the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of the Chinese computers to Lenovo, on the contrary, bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote its full attention to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, a "smarter planet".
Its aim is to use technology smartly in areas that have not yet been planned and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban administration.
For the business area, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia back then in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM CR, the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno also operates here.
Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
"Richtary about an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, don't give me that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darina hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she's not going to wait, and she's set clear rules for another life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartošová in her home in the summer, she probably did not dream how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved from Říčana after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned from her husband’s relationship and now she even gave him good-bye forever.
The knights don't care who his wife sleeps with.
After all, if Rychtář and Bartosha broke up once, he would not be expected at home by the open arms of his wife.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our house together, no one will cast him out."
"But she will live to see him not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová revealed, saying that she had already detached herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing the back door for now.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company keeps going, I'm doing repairs, gardening, real estate, shopping."
"We talk to Darina perfectly normally, except we don't share our beds," said the St.
If Rychtářová also found a new love, she said she wouldn't stop it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," said Josef.
Worst female vices: do they concern you?
If you ask the men if they could name any typical female vices, they'd usually all be very quick to throw them out of their sleeves.
Dear women, will you get to know each other in the following lines, where there are several female vices that can perfectly pump the blood in men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like shopping in bulk at discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should restrain their shopper’s passion at least a little.
But tell me, who can resist walking around the clothing stores, looking for a good fit top and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in the dressing room?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you at the front door...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you need to stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners complain about their looks all the time.
The stronger the sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying the women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Window washing, vacuuming, paving, dust scrubbing, scrubbing the tub - at least twice a week.
Are you blaming your partner for stepping on a clean tile with his dirty feet, for soiling the scrubbed sink and putting on a glassed-out living wall with so much work?
In the event that you suffer from this very "advertisement", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not be placed first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanness can endanger your relationship with one another and your family’s well - being.
Ripping
"Throw the used shorts in the trash."
"You're gonna wear those old socks tomorrow too?"
"A wet cloth doesn't belong on the ground."
If you poke your mate this way several times a day, know that you can reliably piss him off.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make it all right.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to dig into them so much...
Rumoring, gossiping
For some women, there are also rumors, gossip, and insults and conspiracy against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Perhaps each of us has some harmless little gossip or gossip going on every once in a while.
Hand on heart, it's all women's own.
However, the opposite is the gossip of the roughest grain, which likes and often gossips, perhaps despise everyone and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the framework of the female working group -.
Jagr and Voráček helped with the assists to win Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in the Monday NHL game with two assists on the Philadelphia 5:3 victory on the Carolina ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was declared the best player of the game, benefited from a list of thirty-nine-year-old stars.
Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the match.
After the match, the Jagr claimed to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
"Before the game, I told him he was going to have a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get such a feeling," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the first Flyers shot.
A while later, the team had a Czech footprint.
Voráček won a disc behind the goal of Hurricanes and presented it between the rings scoring Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first break decreased in weakening the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagre, he scored a third goal, then his shot melted through the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," appreciated Jagr's center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning around," said Jagr.
Carolina made the game a drama, with Tuoma Ruutua's goal, and again Dwyer, who came out of the penalty shootout, got in contrast to one goal.
However, Matt Read did not allow further complications, which ended the renumbering of two to one.
"Excellently intervened in our band Pronger."
"He put out the disc, I picked up the speed, and (Read) drove to a more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia, with victory, took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Czech defenseman Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the game against Buffalo, in the second period he resigned due to injuries in the upper body.
The Candiens, next to the experienced bek, lost two-man lead and lost after a penalty shot of 2:3.
One of their raids didn't turn Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than losing points, was saddened by an extensive sicko in the back row, with the game being finished by only five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The rotation was coming at us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, pushed the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defensemen, P.K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty hits to Winnipeg winning 5:2 over Tampa Bay.
Five different shooters shared the Jets goals, who interrupted the five-game losing streak.
How prices of tours have developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
At that time, travel agencies in the vast majority only sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, since travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus traveled on vacation to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Society in Crimea near the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel independently even within socialist countries.
If the citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise the individual way was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at the time, but it was necessary to stand in line overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Still, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the trip to the West without a foreign exchange promise.
By far, however, the Czechs most often spent their vacation in the Czech Republic, resulting in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs acquired and this habit survives to this day.
Czech travel has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 the holiday in GDR or Bulgaria was our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we no longer realize today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the most popular Croatia until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, visa requirements for neighbouring Western European countries were abolished, which triggered a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria’s Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for a while.
In Paris, for example, Czech trips slept in tent parks, as our incomes at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guest house.
A typical feature of Czech travel in this time was the carriage of own food, cans, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally purchase the Western currency after many tens of years.
However, our standard of living and the average salaries increased, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to increased travel demand, travel agencies have started to prepare charter tours regularly since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper because of the opportunity to negotiate quantity discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs already had visa-free contact with virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which made our travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when thanks to considerable demand was sent from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exotics, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm faraway countries, this winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists, and thus our country has finally become one of the world's most advanced countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and spent more than 15 thousand CZK per person on one foreign holiday for the first time in history, including the cost of their stay.
The general meeting is supposed to find the chairman, but again there's a risk of a stalemate.
Almost five months of Czech football is without the chairman and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on the electoral order to be followed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and, as he left, called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hasek, football slipped back to the battles between the two union chambers that couldn't agree on a common candidate.
This became clear on September 16, when the new President was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov for nothing, because the meeting was blocked and it was not just a method of choice.
In fact, there was no consensus on who had the right to vote at the meeting - whether only the statutory representatives or even the officials mandated by full authority.
There has been a partial agreement on this single point since then, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
Nor did the executive committee, which no longer deals with anything else at its meetings, whether proper or extraordinary, made it too clear.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round in order to rule out the possibility of heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the Statutes or find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of FACR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the Association.
According to the statutes of the proposed third-round model, one of the candidates who will have greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is said to be willing to go on a concession to win a candidate who will gain a higher sum of the percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two thirds of the upper hand at this percentage.
"But that would then make sense of the two previous rounds, which would completely deny the two-chamber concept," the Moravian party Svoboda understands, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the valid statutes.
Tomáš Paclík is somewhat surprisingly in agreement with this, although it is estimated that the electoral order is best suited to Pelt of all candidates.
"I wish that the vote should be made according to the statutes."
"In order not to make up any substitute nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his observations he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he believes that the new President will be known and believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passions will calm the possible progress of today's national team to the European Championships."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, more willingness to work together," says the apple tree official, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
The Rajchl is more reticent.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It's not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations in an intended way."
"This can cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all parties to agree on.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if football generality would be complete by the match.
The aviation special, in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorice, among other things, did not fly from Prague due to technical failure in the morning and was looking for a alternative how part of the executive committee to transport the barrage rematch to the scene.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which may be said to take place on Wednesday, may be decisive.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to force the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot to be done: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to fight for the chairman because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the head of football players of Pilsen Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have met all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have signed up to fight for top office.
"If a good candidate exists, I fight for him, and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a person," Paclík told ČTK.
In a fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchle, Paclík is driven by motivation to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, from going to the head of the FACR.
Paclík also emphasizes that, in the event of his victory, he would have lasted as chairman only until 2013, when a proper general meeting is on the agenda.
In his position, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected to football.
"I've spoken to some people who would be considered."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify themselves with Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is now most concerned about Pelt's connection with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates at the general meeting.
It's so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the chair.
"If he had won, the current state would be preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with Berbra's support, who is a skilled businessman, football would not benefit even more," Paclík said.
He also points out that Pelt’s name was heard years ago in the wake of an investigation into a corruption affair, but from which Pelt came unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football would bring Pelt's victory."
"And how we would also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who, however, also takes his former statement to mind that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman".
But if Paclík triumphed on Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another Rajchl candidate, supported by Paclík before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, is thinking the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could think of him as the head of the representation."
"But he couldn't manage the association with management."
"I don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who attracted great attention in September by standing behind the appeal of the judges' committee led by Luděk Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says he'd have the guts to run the association.
He appeals to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also been in charge of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the premiere league triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to its specific cultivation."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which goes into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy to, for example, Spartan chief Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relations of the FACR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax.
"It is one of the key things that the new President should do."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say frankly where the money will go," he said.
As a liability, Paclík now does not even take his connection to the Pilsen club, even though he claims that the chairman of the FACR should be "over-party".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec again, Rajchl to Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"I don't see the point in me hypocritically transferring my shares to someone at the Pilsen club and going back there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta has promised a new FACR statute that would rule out electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelt promised that, if elected, he would take action so that the FACR would have new statutes that would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
Before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, Jablonec's official is optimistic and believes that the election fight will significantly dampen the potential success of today's football team.
Pelta had already promised before September's unrealized choice that he would concentrate on the representation and acquisition of finance in the event of election.
By the election before the last general meeting, he decided to go to the last minute, so he could use a two-month delay to defend his ideas about football management and present himself in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it is high time for someone to run the association," says the man who is associated primarily with the Apple Club, but who has worked in Sparta and the executive committee of the Union for many years.
That is why he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems with the choice are behind the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they do not allow different interpretations, we have had the President since September," Pelt pointed out.
He had just reworked the most important document of the civic association as a decoy to delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take this as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if I fail."
"It's a principle thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
They say they're still trying not to define against their rivals.
He has previously announced that he can imagine working with Henry Rajchlo, whom he acknowledges because of his legal education, and he knows that his opponent would be his first vice president.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who, on the contrary, left Pelt dry.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's had some success."
"His attacks, however, were undignified and many people were surprised by the campaign."
"That is why many of them are now questioning his true character," said Pelt, who is said to remain loyal to the proclamations he announced in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to representation.
That should be the football window window.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians case or the resounding of last year's corruption scandal."
"Then I would like to go to meetings with the private and state sectors to provide enough money for the entire football game," said ČTK 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his coming to the head of football would not mean any personnel cleansing.
"I would first have to get acquainted with the content of individual employees," Strahov said, where there is an understandable nervousness from the long rule.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being followed by the upcoming general meeting, they believe that on Thursday the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If the only issue is how you're going to vote in the third round, then we can move on."
"Football needs credibility, and it will only be gained by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains an optimist two days before perhaps the decisive day of her functional career.
Rajchl promises to work hard under him
If the current Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic for Thursday's general meeting, many people in the Association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start to work hard.
He wants to push through systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by previous President Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying I'd do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute competence in the executive committee so that each member can take up a particular field."
"And I will give out hard tasks to move football a mile ahead in every segment."
"Many people probably wouldn't be happy about it, because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing other people's work," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he was thinking about not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will keep throwing sticks at me and questioning my every move," he explained.
"Many people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Haske.
"There's been a lot of work done over the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"There are started processes that will be revitalized in a few years' time, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, worried that in the event of the election of another candidate Miroslav Pelta, the situation on the union could return to the time before Haskem.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelt can do."
"Behind him, there are mainly people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for taking sides."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl remarked.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be Czech President.
"Even if some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"This would not be the current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík has joined the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice-President and sees that I have clear achievements behind me," said Rajchl, who considers the savings of tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiation of television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law to be his achievements.
On the contrary, he takes for complicity that the union is not pulling together.
While Pelt claims to be "disqualified to restore confidence in Czech football", he considers the other of Paclík's rivals to be a strong candidate who has much to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he had been elected, he might have continued with the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," says Rajchl, rivals.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Pools
Jump into blue
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from the point of view of UFO, a luxury swimming pool in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after visiting cities or travelling let their tired feet rest in the thermal bath.
The book will show where the wellness near the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on discovery trips in the past one and a half years, her luggage should not miss her bathing suit.
Lying on the water, she looked up to the height of artistically shaped domes, swam across from the marble putti (a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) who waited for her at the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked any of the swimming pool, she carried it into her notebook in a flash - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by the historian of the architecture Meder and are now presented in her book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) ": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historical palace of the swimming pools in Schwarzwald, "The Hard Core of Concrete Structures" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "Travel behind the most unusual spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for the Polish culture.
It's not too much sport, says Meder - just in the water it's something else.
To anger it is only that fans of swimming have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine odours, while health runners can breathe in the intoxicating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly", says living Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started to collect nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real sighting: "Instead of the floor, a man has a water surface in the spa."
"It is both transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically doubled: high arches, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
A small-format picture volume "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis of wellnes - but above all, the desire to jump into blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by Mrs. Meder in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, it found nitrate water in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jaszberény).
On the other hand, many open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful spectacle. While you can see the whole city from the top of the mountain, you can watch the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of the spa in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the traffic on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
The steam rises from the three upwards of the open pans in winter while the sky rises in the background of Mount Ötztal.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool has Mrs. Meder's smell of chlorine risen to the nostrils.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the Árpad spa in Bekescsaba, Hungary, it smells like heating oil to the point where you hardly believe that you have reached the spa.
The smell comes from a medicinal water containing alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as one slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, the architect Dušan Jurkovič designed the spa was closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the huge growth of weeds between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood up in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already had three stages of construction; one can discover not only neo-Romanian elements that originated in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra Hall, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995 Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for pool expert Iris Meder, not only because she comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's been quite a feat to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At a palace like this, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a peripheral matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank has a commodity trade vetted
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the group chief wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand Deutsche Bank and the other credit institutions to step out of this business because it deepens the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of the Forsa survey under the responsibility of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that the stakes at global commodity exchanges drive prices to a height, and the banks are therefore complicit in the world’s hunger problem.
The consumer campaign is directed specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley also act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk business have detached themselves from supply and demand - and made profits on the account of the poorest.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to the criticism of Ackermann: He promised to examine the criticisms and said that no trade "was worth putting on the stake of Deutsche Bank's reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group controls complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The check is to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, together with a recommendation on how to do so.
At the end of January, the bank’s representatives want to tell us what the consequences will be.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his image by himself.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time increased his criticism of the financial sector: 'Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are today harming the general good'.
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, do his duty.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items from its portfolio for which money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"Insert whether Mr. Ackermann is hungry for people suffering or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group boss would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before he left office.
On Monday Deutsche Bank announced that the head of board of directors would not go to the Supervisory Board.
Averting the questionable agrarian speculation could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - that should be dealt with in the end by his successor.
Each other would testify to the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is precisely 11 percent that Deutsche Bank considers it legitimate to offer investments involving food price bets.
Many banks’ customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: each other, as a result of the survey, would testify to all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn the acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said that they would think about shutting down their account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Removal pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endem: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is dedicated to modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is a fitting and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and protruding structure of steel and glass.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous so that he also built the pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key carried out by a side construction in Munich, 1973 finally became famous internationally.
Its temporary exhibition building was designed by the pavilion after the world exhibition in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Railway Station), renovated and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - it was named "House of the 20th century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Yet it was used until the contemporary art was given a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and decaying more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz reconstructed the pavilion, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere, has made a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a distinguished art historian with a distinguished career, i.e. a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museo Modern Salzburg, strongly promoted reconstruction with politicians and memorialists, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, works by sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same-named foundation, a café and a bookstore should be established, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Close surveillance, low budget.
To perform, Krischanitz was then the ideal cast.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the University of Technology in Schwanzer and the pavilion was "an extremely important place" for him, at which "almost every weekend" he looked at exhibitions.
He knew the original project and he also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and ease in its relocation to Vienna and its change of use.
In the present reconstruction there were much bigger problems: the building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
Profiles of glass facade windows were replaced by glass fibres reinforced insulation glass and glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rescinded.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a towering Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door was preserved, the building is painted in an old anticorrosion red-brown color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the Memorial Office and the low budget.
"Often there had to be found material that was good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Office", says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
He said it was difficult with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
It is said that such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to build proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, because a urban accident occurred: There is a completely new design of the "Městská čtvrť u Hlavní nádraží" with office and residential buildings within the Schweizer Garten circuit.
And perhaps another happy coincidence will arise: the 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already negotiating with the city a neighbourhood at Schweizer Garten.
The runway is planning a million-dollar package for the winter crisis
The runway set up a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter season.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against cold caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn spends more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report referring to the internal group plan that total investments of around EUR 300 million are expected to be made by 2015.
It is said that better use of trains and rail networks should also be achieved under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff to 16 000 people to remove snow on railway installations and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for operation of the necessary switches within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, the head of railways, warned of train failures and delays during this winter after a top-level meeting with government and industry officials.
In the past winter, the passenger transport route had considerable problems, because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions it had a shortage of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, delays in ICE train delivery are also taking place.
It has also been unable to manage for years that ICE trains must be repaired more often by the workshop when a single ICE train at Köln Central Station was destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the USA
After the excitement about Chief Josef Ackermann, new tramps are taking place in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million in damages there.
As if the Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, it caught up with a giant in the field of its past in the US: Frankfurt’s institution pays $145 million in a settlement procedure (106 million euro) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage certificates.
NCUA’s financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers have lost considerable value during the crisis and have torn banks with them into abysses.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the subject without having to drag the parties to court", said Deutsche Bank's spokesperson in New York.
The bank admits no guilt by settling.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The Chairman of the NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the accommodation of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and helps bankruptcies protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for the billions of damages.
Now completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped to other big banks and in summer he sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The dubious mortgage sheets are called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US housing bubble collapsed in 2007, it became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Although events took place a few years ago, the banks are now being blown by a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous actions to correct or to penalise misconduct.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He blames 18 international big banks that two state-owned US real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have put about $200 billion of mortgage deals at a disadvantage.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA action, with more deals totaling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without, of course, mentioning any precise amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters the IBM with $10 billion.
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM IT.
Since March, he has purchased more than ten billion dollars worth of shares.
So far, a major American investor, Warren Buffett, has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers because long-term development of companies is only difficult to predict.
But now he has read the IBM business reports and changed his mind about investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and manufactures computer systems for IT-department of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered knighting in the financial world.
As a result, the motherly rock of IT IBM may now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett revealed at the American economic radio station CNBC that since March he had purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5,5 percent stake.
Buffett sagte that even IBM had not yet known anything about his involvement.
He commended management, which, during the economic crisis, tried even for proper returns.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT-services like computer center operations for a long time.
More than 100-year-old computer pioneers also offer software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has been avoiding technology companies to date.
They claim that they only invest in companies whose activities they also understand.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, lubricant manufacturers or machine products.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns alongside about 80 of its own subsidiaries also shares in a number of wholesalers such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
In the 1960 ’ s, 81 - year - old master took over a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s shares rose by one percent before the stock market started.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market and is considered by Apple and Microsoft to be the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, so many Buffetts, he wouldn't want to get on.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his confidential friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the discovery of the "Bunka in Zwickau", Turkish media are questioning the German rule of law.
The paper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now coming back to life.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was responded to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
Because for many German Turks, the specter has been coming back, long thought to be dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
There was never any doubt that there was xenophobia in Germany.
But the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals an extent that can no longer be supervised.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" were the headlines of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police agent for the Constitutional Protection Department and fear that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded wisely: It recalled during the weekend a demonstration of silence before the Brandenburg Gate of victims of racist violence.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, remembered the ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
There are several Turkish media coverages: "Gift to 50" is the title of the article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murder series.
The issue of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany is also not to be taken into account in order not to make this thought connection.
"It's starting to smell," sounds the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasises that people who paid taxes were murdered and made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany by their work.
The most critically discussed in the German Internet forums is the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think of searching for suspects in right-wing extremist circles much earlier, the authors wonder.
This is how many perform at least rhetorically prompt to use drastic means: 'If the activity continues to be so superficial, the immigrants will be left with nothing but their own defenses and armed'.
"That's probably the best self-defense."
"The quality of the clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the internal peace in Germany", writes Selen.
What it means when internal peace is threatened in Germany is explained by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burn site in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
But the assassinations have made the Turks feel more reciprocal.
Do not repeat mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German policy after the assassinations was first criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a sympathetic telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the funeral ceremony in Köln.
Quite as if the value of a man was measured by the height of his taxes.
The current news coverage of Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local state-of-law arrangement is.
In addition to efforts to comprehensively clarify and re-evaluate right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
The Scandal Bank at Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is based not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to another ever since.
Now it's supposed to be settled by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, he became known in July to take up almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidarity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But it was clear in September that everything would turn out quite differently.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and wasted around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, a respected banker, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS Board has also been intoxicated - and everyone asks, "When is Axel Weber finally coming?"
It has already become known that Weber may advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the Presidency of the Management Board in May - not just in 2013, as the Bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough on Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
He will then take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which just once proved itself worthy of the title "Bank of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is huge - until recently it has been the world's largest asset manager - and it has been slipping for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, will not be spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed excellent reputations.
The image of a silent and solid but also a cunning asset manager combines with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So she managed UBS 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it has advanced into the league of the world's largest banks
That was impressive.
Former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger relates: "I always listed my students at that time UBS as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one asks, "How could I have been so wrong?"
He was wrong greatly.
In 2007, it became clear for the first time that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who was considered to be a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, there was a hunch as to why he left.
The Bank’s investment division wasted Subprime-paper and had to write off billions.
To keep it going, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But she did find investors, but one over which she would have recently turned her nose: the Opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one didn't even know its name.
But that was just the first impact.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS, due to its misinvestments in the financial crisis, stood before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought out of UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatory exchangeable bonds for which it could have become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We could not save UBS again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by a second one.
For several months after that, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with America and has shown its willingness to issue data to wealthy customers who, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - to return unauthorized profits from these transactions, including a fine premium.
This made UBS more or less open to helping tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss bank secrets were no longer what they used to be.
The resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board followed.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over a period of months: in investment banking due to poor speculation and asset management for aiding tax cuts.
And just as it calmed down again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business anabase: The only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: things are still not working out with investment banking risk management.
"The case of Adoboli was probably found to have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Zürich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also sure: "The problem of UBS is that he cannot handle risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers stepped up a long time ago to become guardians of the world's great possessions: no too great risks, but security for money - also on this side, the Alpine Republic collapsed the world again.
The Swiss banks’ safes have become a symbol for unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for high quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich are still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
It's a classic location.
The bank has its headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which leads directly to the Lake of Zurich, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli's.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall UBS is entering through a heavy revolving door.
Inside there are walls lined with marble, in front of them are massive leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank a large sign to the "syphus".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
However, the idea of the Swiss bank was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He'd rather not read his name in the papers, he eventually closes business with both big banks, like all Swiss bankers.
UBS has probably grown too much, finding out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything else to say.
"And if they had, they would have adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits at first, and then disaster: No European financial institute lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-dollar country has come to the greatest rescue event in the history of its nation", writes Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or some 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save the bankruptcy of a standing big bank.
How could this happen?
If they're talking to Swiss bankers, they see a problem in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks merged into a massive group.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for a small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
It helped that both different bank predecessors of UBS were complementary: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a centre of gravity in asset management and poorer but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette wheel.
Two names are associated with this increase in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007 and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a person who manages the feelings around the stomach, who has developed from banking science completely up."
But they say Ospel relied on Wuffy at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "I guess he thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It's clear: pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall meetings of executives, at which the group chief Wuffli repeated the same password again and again: Knock Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The US Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It stated "League Tables", a waiting list documenting the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS was trying to position itself at the very top.
She's done a few steps already.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she participated in the game at the top.
However, the business advisors who have been assigned stress one weakness: there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks in international interest trade, in the talk of the "Fixed Income" bankers.
UBS may have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS has committed itself to an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its established fund invested to hedge risks in US investment Subprime.
It developed into a massive machine that changed the securities into US mortgage loans and passed on - but it also retained its risks.
Also, when other banks long ago were looking for a way out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there," says bank expert Geiger.
How great is the euphoria, so deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean were more difficult than thought.
UBS positions have become an ejector seat, and they're rocking until today.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
They need to find a strategy for the bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
The bank expert Geiger has already had an idea: no more investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
Although the bank (still) does not want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to go down strongly, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he asserted: He is to run UBS business in the long term, announced by the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its state in the mid-1990s.
3,500 places to cross off.
That's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But so far he is publicly saying that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe is heavy on the US stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has deprived American investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.

In particular, the financial values were on the sales tickets.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values recorded a decrease of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points in order to end trading.
During trading, the barometer of the market was between 12.027 and 12.170 points.

Industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and has prepared to end the boom.
Businesses produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
"We are not an island, but an addict," said Steve Goldman from Goldman management.
Europe will not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of banks’ weakness.
Warren Buffett's legend of investing only confirmed this outlook: He said in one CNBC-interview that it would probably not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That is probably why it is too early, from his point of view, to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the decades old principle and joined the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM strengthened the stock exchange rate of the traditional group and had it quoted by almost one percent above against the trend during trading.

Smart Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, says experts.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been in the picture of the city for centuries, yet in some communities complaints about uncleanness and noise caused by animals are piling up.
There is not yet any means against "problem birds" in sight.
Ravens of the field may no longer be evicted from the cities, experts at the first symposium on crows in Leer, East Africa.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for Alternatives in Cities
The conservationists also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture may increasingly destroy traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing construction, and cutting down typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting couples are among other things in Soest, Westphalia, northwest, including Jever, Diepholz, and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There 2005 sparked a controversial project of mass killing crows in the rural district of negative headlines.
Critics have labeled trapping animals for birds and killing sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal exorcism, timidity, nothing brings", so much learned by the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies break down and divide into other places."
Shyness is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
"The information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One charcoal in the face can best survive with confidence."
Ms Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg Nature Crow Path, on which the information boards provide lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: 'This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say to each other.'
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Ravens of the field do not use only aids to reach a treat, but even make their tool as a tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested behavior on four ravens of the field as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that stones must cause the collapse of the structure to reach the larvae of the pier.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more arduous problem.
In a vertical cylinder, researchers placed a tiny container of larvae.
By beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
Of them all four of the animals formed a hook, using it as a pointer to fish out of the pipe the container behind the holder.
Three of the four ravens of the field managed to do it even with a plug.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the European Championship 2012
The hope of Bosnians and Turks didn't work out for the cup.
Favorité Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the European Championship 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoff matches.
Leaded by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronald (8, 53), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Hercegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth turn in the European Championships perfect after the result of 0:0 in the first match.
In response to Playoff with outsider Černá Hora, the result was 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was clear.
The goal was not even given by Croatia with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland reached a relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the League of Zvajezdan Misimovic transformed penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed Portugal in the 2010 World Cup playoffs.
On Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a custom-made start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his qualities in shooting at a long distance and adjusted the 25-metre shot to 2:0.
Bosnians, who did not perform in the first half hour, had their first clear chance at goaltender Edin Dzek.
The former Wolfsbur player from the English leader of the table standing the Manchester City club placed the ball on the lower edge of the bridge, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, at the center of Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After the intervention against Helder Postig in Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36)
On the other hand, Stark made a disputed penalty kick after Fabio Coentraa, who had certainly transformed Misimovic.
But after the break, the European Vice-Champion of 2004 cleared everything up with four shots.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended his last doubts in 81st minute.
With this he leaves the champion of Europe from 1976 for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
The team of trainers Michal Bilk with the legionary of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.
The goaltender Petr Čech stopped reflectively at the last moment possible his own goal Tomáš Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its biggest options when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the speed from the border of the criminal territory just around Bohemia's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked down goaltender of the world class Czechs, again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50.).
Just before the conclusion, Branka finally cleared everything up.
Turkey missed a football miracle in Zagreb at the time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to relax his seat on the third bench during the 2002 World Cup, Croats can enjoy their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience almost a fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only a stick with a shot from a distance in the seventh minute, the attacker Kazim also could not swing the bounce ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia was increasingly in control.
Also, after the Croats broke, they didn't get the goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who had been releasing Ivan Perisice, the legionaries of the Federal League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) from 62 minutes ago.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who took care of the success of 4:0 in the first game for a preliminary decision, in 32 minutes to lead.
Konstantin Vassilev (57.) settled for guests.
Ireland set the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that Estonian defense prevented the possible leader of the goal.
But at 32 minutes, it was quite far.
After the failed defense of goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to state 1:0.

SAP wants to double its workforce in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double its number of employees in the country.
By 2015, it is said that about $2 billion (approximately 1.5 billion euro), reported Dax on Tuesday.
"We will create other research and development facilities and employ relevant staff", announced Deputy Chief Bill McDermott at the Beijing Customer Fair.
The staff is now to increase from the current 2500 employees to 4500.
The number of branches of the world leader in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are booming in a country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s strategy for 2015.

SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...), McDermott said.
"Our goal, with the support of extensive research, is to promote sustained growth in China."
Massacre on a personal level
An emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund called Beauty and Grief: The Confidential History of World War I (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of performers that you get dizzy.
One piece of advice on how to behave at that moment: Carefully rip this page out and make it a bookmark.
You will get to know all the people in Mr. Englund's novel story, and this list will serve you as a navigation - a kind of beacon - at times when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite fittingly, as an "antihistorical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, but almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists, and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, like, "the book about what it was like." It mainly deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives are shimmering like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the entanglement of fate while others are extinguishing.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that World War I was just about the fearsome trench fighting on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" is also a skilled exploration of other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with bees' nests falling on them, spending Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or struggling with the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning, this is a very moving reading.
War consumes people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When a gunfire starts to ring in the distance, and you're the woman who's home with her kids, run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was unleashed.
"Vakuum resulting from lack of facts," Englund noticed, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from CVs, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound both frightening and captivating, but thanks to the integration of tiny moments and details, they are absolutely alive and believable.
Many of them discuss hardship and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Alternatives, all substitutes."
"A substitute for coffee, imitation aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to "mass made of pressed rice cooked in sheep fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), tobacco of dried roots and dried potato skins, wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds internal impulses for savagery and brutality in himself, and then declares about the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books and pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarian hiding behind the starched self inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When you finally accept the sacrifice, you would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convicted man he'll secretly hang."
Other comments concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"Conflict has become more and more economic competition and competition," Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He caught what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress who carries out his bloodshed without rising from the table."
People act out of the blue, meanness takes turns with heroism.
Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the gonococian pus trading, which soldiers bought and wiped their genitals with it in the hope that they would end up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones would rub it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation by Peter Graves in Swedish, Mr Englund's prose is brisk, but not spectacular, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which war "launched completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I mostly worked with signs rather than complex narratives, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels like "The West Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending that is unprecedented in popular literature.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, tore the page from your list of heroes out of your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute precisely planned raid
Hundreds of police officers participated in it, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was elected because by that time Zuccotti park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except for a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the event, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases from recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, were not allowed to be repeated, thereby violating the rules of separation, and in addition, the wave of public sympathy spilled over to the side of the squatters.
That is why the police operation aimed at cleaning Zuccotti Park from protestors was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by operations in other cities.
Massive behavioral exercise in crisis situations took place in the part of Randalls Island, which was preparing for an event in Zuccotti Park.
The leaders have increased the so-called training for riot suppression - anti-terrorist measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" said someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "training".
"I know a few police officers who have also been called into this event, and no one has told them that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that they remain anonymous.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew that they were going to Zuccotti Park."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had already received once.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean up the park, but then retreated from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them were flocking to the park before the operation began.
On Tuesday's event, police officers from various units took part, including intervention groups from all around - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with a higher level of crime.
Mr Kelly explained that a large number of people came and went during the day, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and recorded news of the amplions scared many protesters.
When the members of the police forces entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give the protestors time to pack their things.
Other police teams have been spotted gathering on the edge of the park to get in if any arrests are needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman of the police department, claimed that this was for their own safety.
Many journalists, however, believe that the police wanted to stop them from seeing her troops in action, and that some police officers were being rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that TV cars on Church Street along the west border of the park could easily be filmed.
Police were moving westwards, and they were entangled with the protestors’ personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the health department, who immediately rallied everything left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were taken out of the park. Documenting image materials appeared shortly afterwards on the Internet.
The most vicious group of protestors has resorted to the kitchen near their campground, which was close to the centre of the park.
Some created a roadblock, and the police started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp were handcuffed to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most arrests were made due to "organization of riots and resisting arrests," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives in the department, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr Kelly was present, but "he did not participate in the management of the operation," said Mr Browne.
A second group of officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were erected.
From these places the police then developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., a protester was spotted south of Pine Street as he jumped on the hood of a police car, and several others who were blowing air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
The Auxiliary Union will sue the city for release.
The departments representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were not necessary and that there was discrimination because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The Court’s argument is probably the last option left for the District Council 37 trade unions in their attempt to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy - two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst - paid city employees lost their jobs. Their dismissal was described by the heads of the union as a retaliatory of the city for not allowing him access to the health care fund managed by the working crews that led the city to stick a hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the board immediately checked that there was no specific mention of the release of auxiliary workers in the budget.
The representatives of District Council 37 announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will call a press conference to formally announce a lawsuit at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
The defendants will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight laid-off workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, said that the city has not yet seen a lawsuit, so it will not comment on individual charges.
According to the draft complaint that the New York Times was able to obtain, the unions focused on the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city, which wanted to support their claim of unfair conduct, because they held that poor schools had lost more assistants because they had been denied sufficient funds for a long time.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island did not release at all and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, 46 assistants were even released.
It recalls that at the Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty.
Public School's budget of 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus funds for each applied-in poor student.
The unions claim, among other things, that high school directors may have been confused by the way in which the document authorising the release of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available staff whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Six and six parent coordinators have been released," the complaint states, "and not just moved to the database to the position of available staff."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to take a deal on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Commission for International Relations will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) in which he should congratulate the Libyans for their successful uprising and American troops for their "strategy".
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both parties of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
Those sentences may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides were constantly arguing with each other and with the White House about the text of a series of statements for approval or, on the contrary, the rejection of the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of the U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures to stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
Thus, the US mission in Libya found itself literally in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama is running the mission, but it obviously did not irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
Congress's hesitantness was eventually preceded by other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
The Nato mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations, in its statement, 'congratulations the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity they have spent in their efforts to free their people' and 'praising the men and women of the United States armed forces and their allies, who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population, for extraordinary bravery and professionalism'.
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators once again be divided into two halves, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), head of the Republican Party's commission, opposed the latest version.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
This week, the House will vote on an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution concerning the budget or other subject on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
Other legislators have not yet managed, despite considerable efforts, to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 additions to the constitution, which were presented in Congress and touched on a wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to both the House and the Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
Only in the House can there be at least 15 versions of the amendment on a balanced budget and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their advocates - especially emerging Republicans, who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The revenue on budget regulation approved in August required both the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding statement to support the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limitation of the number of periods in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of additions that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an amendment prohibiting the marriage of same-sex couples, and an amendment prohibiting the burning of a national flag.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be annulled if two thirds of the states oppose them.
Although the members of Congress seem to be very active in designing various additions, they do not appear to be significantly off average compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress they offered 77 additions, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even fades compared to the early 1990s, when, according to statistics from the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Battered, but not defeated," says Gifford in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after the shooter injured her at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declared that she wanted more than a return to Congress to get well.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" at ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was obvious that she still needed help making sentences.
The whole show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the bullet wound that punctured her skull in the front, penetrated her left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first TV interview from the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, smiled and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Well done."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special on "20/20", which was broadcast on the eve of the release of a new book by this couple, entitled "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
Special has been tracking the entire recovery of Gifford since the shooting of January 8th.
The videos Kelly made during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar all over her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than lift one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair, and therapists are teaching her how to perform simple activities.
Nodding your head.
Lip pout.
And then, her first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a key role in the recovery of Giffords: The congresswoman sings along with the therapist on the melody to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that she did not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford was reading newspaper articles about the shooting on March 12, when she first asked him who she was, the six who were killed in the incident.
The shooting is a suspect named Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missouri, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violently administered drugs.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Worse, terrible, terrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife, during her recovery, said, "I lost."
"So I immediately said to her, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you can do it, you get back together, and you come back even stronger than ever."
Military troops meet with compassion rather than with respect
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who didn't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines ran past him.
The festively dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who held the spring benefit.
Admiral Mike Mullen was also on the scene, but he saw the role of military forces rather differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was pity.
Such totally opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is immaculate with praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if the individual in uniform regretted.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words about regret are spoken quietly and privately among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat events where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their ministry from two angles.
From the point of view of some, they will feel respect and amazement because they defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will wonder if "the evil, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and took a place in Washington in government after returning.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him were inconspicuous about whether he could withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The concern of the army partly stems from America's indifference to wars.
Success on the battlefield rarely reaps recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own army, and finds little self-interest in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer respect military heroism as it used to be during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to hit hard against rape
This week, it will be decided whether 28 women and men will be tried against the military because of alleged inactivity in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other applicants are prepared to file a lawsuit.
First class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, allegedly raped by a fellow military officer.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the barracks at the Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they could have a little drink in her room.
"The warning light went on in my head," Lyman described.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they walked into her room, a man crossed over, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former military members will be waiting for a verdict of a hearing that could have a historical impact, which will take place in Arlington, Virginia, to see if the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to justice.
The charges state that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which runs counter to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, the charges were filed by Washington's lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. However, over the next few months, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish, and prosecute.
Burke says she's after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to take action against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than gathering all the charges in this case - she stacked all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in more than one case, if the pressure is needed not to ease.
The Defense Department's defense team is headed by the U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his coworkers, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek discuss the defense strategy in detail - in principle, current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Alleged injuries concern the military service of the defendants," says the document.
The Department of Defense has refused to comment on this matter.
But things have changed since the 1950 ’ s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is just a word-playing: it is difficult to find a clear frontline in modern wars.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly important role, especially in communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell between these wars - two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to upgrade, too, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academys for the alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for its anti-military lawsuit. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personal disorder", which was reportedly found in rape victims, so that the army has an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati, who belong to a group of human rights fighters of the Service Women's Action Network, is a very common practice.
Its group already filed a complaint in December against the state organisation for dealing with veterans, which was accused of discriminatory practices that were to take place in the processing of requests for assistance by persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, which were tabled by a group of senators and Members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Department of Defence's Department of Preventing and Solve Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases, and according to Pentagon estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In a report issued in March, the rate of criminal prosecution of suspects is also discussed: in 2010 20 percent of cases reported in the military – half of them compared to the civilian justice system – were brought to trial.
In the case of Deputy Burke, prosecutors describe the attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
For example, Private First Class Lyman reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after it was to take place.
During the night, she says she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She took all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and in her bed, the blood of the attacker was found from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which she was asked questions about whether she had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were called to testify as witnesses of the reputation in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the sentence was passed," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there at the scene - screaming out of the courtroom."
"They put me on a psych unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "It wasn't his trial.
The Lymans ordered a military psychiatrist to see her who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder, thus calling her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and thus without entitlement to service.
Whether the Lyman case and the other prosecutors move on to the next stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the negotiations."
But there is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since the first moment she saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army is several decades behind because their duties do not give rise to the same level of motivational impulses and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
The only way to change is if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in favour of them, Burkevoá, the defendants' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a complaint and start working on other cases relating to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, from which there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous rage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to go on Facebook.
"We realized that finding them isn't really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett that it was enough for scientists to simply use the advertising on the site, and thanks to that, they have determined with absolute precision the demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, then they focused their attention on them and sent them advertisements, but instead of inviting them to the newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they invited them to fill out a questionnaire that asked questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online followers of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are irritated by the increasing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with their offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends that hide state updates, wall contributions and pressed "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data on average daily, which literally makes this social network "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new researches. The number of academic works in whose name the word Facebook is known has risen to almost 800% over five years ago.
For some scientists, it is the magic of Facebook that gives them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey among the British National Party people, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where they'd never let you go," says Bartlett.
"All this Facebook is breaking down - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of Wisconsin University, the research team found that university students who were discussing their drunken performance on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that peers of students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you cannot diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise not have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team of the site has developed statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, the election participation in 2010 and the National Satisfaction Factor (mainly using the information to which they had access - Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should make its information treasure available for research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site follows them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information to the site.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most of the users ever thought that scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it as information between them and their friends."
Subsequently, it is also necessary to consider the question of methodology.
Even with off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
"If you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something you can't replace," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik takes part in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter of the resistance.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights of Templar," he said in court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because the mandate was given to you by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I admit no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a prepared speech, to address relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, to ban any contact with the media for four weeks, and to announce that the competent authorities would have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some have come in the hope that they will be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he is locked up tight.
They all took part in moving the case to early closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told the commentator NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved mentally a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and leaving the building without any difficulty in seeing the journalists present and the survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge acknowledged that he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
Some may find it comforting that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she'd fall out like a monster, but she's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, things would be so much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and elected him the greatest modern inventor of his genius.
The recent re-discovered Jobs interview, which was dusted up for a special film heading to the cinemas this week, will be the fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind understood perfectly the business processes and working flows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and person who matches every little detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffered "the idea that 90 percent of their work was really great... [but] between a great idea and an excellent resulting product is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on a TV show called Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the shooting, there was a unique, more than hourly interview.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and he eagerly watched the general public accept the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely’s entire conversation was used on the TV show, and original copies of the interview were reported missing during transport.
Shortly after Jobs died, however, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
This material, slightly edited, forms the basis of a 68-minute Steve Jobs film: The lost interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
Jobs is surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies for someone who has known his aversion to providing longer interviews.
And he also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds to think about how Jobs perfectly thinks about the answer to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism is coming to the surface, when he is impatient about Cringely’s questions and moves him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was made before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, and there are scary prophetic ideas in it when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to read the postmortem evaluations of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the bloom of his genius.
He's got his own vision of how things could and should look.
It did not take long for him to put his ideas into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noticing:
As he learned to run the business:
"During years of business, I always asked, "Why are you doing this?" and the answer was always the same: "Well, that's how you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business matters.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify Apple’s accounts.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the sign "standard costs", he could only imagine their amount. At that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs within moments.
How he did a ruse on the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to hack into telephone companies effectively and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
A number of things have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
They tell us how Wozniak and his devices tested using a pay phone, and during the call they got transferred from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times, we've gotten this way around the world, so when we shouted something on a pay phone, it came back a minute later from the other phone at the door," laughs Jobs.
"We were young and found ourselves able to build a thing capable of managing a billion-dollar infrastructure around the world."
We made ourselves a tiny little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would ever have been able to create a company without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the joke that Wozniak and he had almost finished. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, making the best of Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, the Catholic Church members were called up to talk to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was just before the pope himself was summoned to the phone that the couple trembled and put the earpiece down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett's phone number in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the corporate research laboratory in Palo Alto where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager, I went up and up in HP, hung around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How he invents innovation:
In a few places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products on the run.
In the early days of his career, when he went to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 days paid, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember when we were fighting wildly... yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] until I got tired of it, went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies run out of breath:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs foresightfully predicted that many industrial leaders would fluctuate in their visions and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox companies, so you make better copiers or printers, so what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company cannot be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are already in place, so the companies are in charge of the people who are in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are being evicted from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led society to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times as big as it is, could have been Microsoft in the '90s...
Instead of winning, however, they lost.
How he takes innovation as an art form:
"There is still a long way to go and a lot of work between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product... and as the great idea develops, it is changing and growing."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You have to accept a number of compromises - certain things simply do not make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and coincidentally also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question as to whether it would object to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that would take part in the hearings before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions put forward.
One of the cases discussed was the action brought by 26 states questioning the radical recasting of healthcare last year by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the action, but a 5,5-hour meeting is expected in March, with the result of which the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
Paul Clement, who served as US Attorney General during the reign of George W. Bush, will most likely be a lawyer who will stand before the Court of Justice and try to get the bill rejected.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, which has been engaged in defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at the Washington hotel several hours after the court debate on the subject of the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act, took part in it.
And the guest list, Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: This pair of judges have been participating in the Federalist Society’s events for years.
And it's definitely nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their behaviour would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are being organised by related and other organisations for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor may he be mentioned on the agenda of the event."
Nevertheless, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two law firms involved in the case, as well as companies with huge financial interest in the case, was richly enough to alert activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct runs counter to the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and dined at a social benefit together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines their feet with all claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics and told them that they too, without problems, combine their judicial obligations with those of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Ginnie is a high-ranking conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives argue that Judge Elena Kagan, and not Scalia, has an ethical problem with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General during President Obama's reign when the first objections against the law appeared in court.
Critics of Kagan are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought so much for the law then that she could now be unbiased.
Kagan didn't suggest she was about to resign.
Boeing acquired a record contract for jets worth USD 18 billion
Emirates airlines order 50 two-street Boeing 777 jets with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air airlines for which it collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if the airline manufacturer is Boeing Co., and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it's something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the order from: Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East airline will need 2,520 US$450 billion aircraft over the next 20 years.
The Boeing company announced its biggest order in history this weekend as regards the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-street current Boeings 777.
The sensational order came from Emirates Airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing said that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, which would increase the total value of the contract to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, then, Boeing announced that the Oman Air airline ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also known as Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire company Boeing," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-mining nations there.
This means that they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but an increase in the price of fuel - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - it is not so crucial, because the country itself earns at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to an increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The deal from Emirates airlines consolidates the leading position of Boeing on the wide-hull aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to its narrow position, which wanted to try to undermine the dominance of Boeing with its A350 transport model.
The victory of Boeing comes four months after Airbus’s representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of 777-300ER, will be postponed.
The postponement was due to the fact that customers demanded more utility load and ranges, so the manufacturer took time to deliver more power to the machine.
The price of Boeing Co's events increased by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
The Mexican president's sister was apparently defeated in the Michoacan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderon lost in the violent state elections for governorship in Michoacan. On Monday, she declared that one of her opponents had been helped by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results were attributed by the Institute Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to the leadership of the West State’s governorial elections to Fausto Vallejo.
"The interventions of members of organised crime into the entire electoral process and especially until yesterday's election are alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview for radio the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion poll group... confiscating ballot boxes, building roadblocks... and letting people vote on order for the PRI.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when it lost its Presidency.
However, it is planning an early return to power, and winning the elections in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was still in charge the day before the election, very close.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative party of her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing party of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has so far dominated the governor's office.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's native state, and it was in Michoacan in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
Violence, however, persisted.
The mayor of PAN, Luisa Maria Calderon's supporter, was murdered just a week before the election, and many candidates for the election resigned out of fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the elections in Michoacan looks like for the PRI party, winning will help the party get a new impulse.
The expected PRI representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Wahington Vallejo and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
The ADB Bank calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB Bank based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help the monetary bloc recover rapidly through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He warned against the fact that the Bric Group states [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all European problems "too unexcited" and said that Asian financial assistance combined with European leadership and resources would help prevent the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but she's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested for several months by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, the borrowing costs of Italy have risen dangerously, and both the heads of government of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could bring the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge to bring the emerging leading economies together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but he noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of European Union financial assistance fund bonds, the institution for European financial stability - would provide greater bargaining opportunities for Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying out of foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are faced with a difficult task and must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a simple fact, because how else could we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutush Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to the 1.2 billion inhabitants of India when 800 million of them live from USD 2 or less per day.
"They might find that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their vacations on the beaches, which would be hard to explain to them," he remarked.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag pointed out that the eurozone crisis is threatening a 'dangerous domino effect'.
The bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% of economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a "risk of decline" because of the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must create "plans of unpredictable spending" in order to protect them from a decline and a significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon Warning on Possible Defense Cutbacks
On Monday in Congress, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta put a lot of pressure on the boiler when he warned that emerging automatic budget cuts could endanger national security and trigger financial chain reaction beginning at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a USD 450 billion cut in the next ten years, but now it fears a $600 billion cut if Congress fails to conclude an spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would result in a 23% flat-rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"It will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipping projects because of such a huge reduction, which is used in this indiscreet way - you cannot buy just three quarters of the building or the ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to further modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"Also, we will be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target demands."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness."
Eventually, the cuts will also touch the combat troops, announced Panetta.
"Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in negotiated contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"Reductions of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and subsequent distortions of legal and political support."
Both Senators wrote back to Panette ten days ago and asked him for details on the possible impact on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a standstill at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as the world military superpower."
"We are strictly opposed to this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panette's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign it."
"The cuts planned are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"First, we will see whether Panette's letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress to approve the budget and amplify the votes calling to leave the Pentagon off the list of decommissioned areas.
Panetta has been getting more and more open lately in talks about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved to his high position at the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held one minute a week, the Minister of Defence indicated a brief picture of what his department could expect - the shell of the army, but within which the core will be missing.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"He will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of the Pentagon speech.
"She'll be like a unit without morality, unprepared and incapable of dealing with a possible enemy."
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed..."
In the annex delivered to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibilities of landings and deployment around the world; an assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the biggest defence projects could expect closure, including those already tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, a project of F35 aircraft, a planned new bomber, next-generation ballistic submarines, a new coastal battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the army and the Marine Corps wanted to replace with humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters claim that this is a necessary further step in improving the army, which is needed for the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A glimpse of recent headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with the accusation that he sexually harassed several women - both parties claim that the other one is lying.
The administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulted the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
A lie has been able to destroy entire careers, including the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately disproved by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using funds from his campaign to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that fell over Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It's crawling with stories of cheating at school and college.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many scams are we dealing with?
Studies show that in one day, you'll be lying somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
Determining lies, or "recognising lies", is a necessary skill for everyone, for personal or professional reasons.
But it is not a social game that is similar, let's say, to Sharada, when one cries out, "I have you." Recognizing deception is a serious sector of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been disproved.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're squirming, stuttering, blushing, or squirming.
But do not conclude that it is somehow difficult to spot and expose liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and emerging sector on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be of great help to you in today's difficult world - especially if your work responsibilities include hiring, holding interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them slacken in vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
From research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say are usually "unspeakable").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called initial observation.
Thanks to him, he'll have later findings to compare them to.
Notice the posture of the subject, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone routinely taps his feet all the time, so that you don't wrongfully accuse him of lying just because he starts to tap his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But consider it only as a warning sign, not as evidence of a lie.
People who tell lies can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their fictional story, turn the toes of shoes to the door, lean towards the exit, change their posture significantly, or show "relief after the interview" - excessive relief and change of position when confession is difficult behind them.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see what a relief it will look like after the interview.
Also feel the language of the subject.
The famous story of Scott Peterson's misrepresentation and use his past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which triggered a nationwide search for her body.
Deluded individuals can also express themselves in measured terms: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or they will repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "melting tongue" to answer the difficult question, "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In such an answer, we don't know much of the facts, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to master the skills to spy on a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a fraud in his personal and professional capacity.
The controversial oil pipeline construction plan will be rerouted after the threat of postponement of approval by the US government has emerged.
A few days after Obama’s government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico – thus turning the unions against each other, but calming down environmentalists – a company in charge of the pipeline construction announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things would move again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska and is convinced that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebra government.
The scale of TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead through a different route.
This announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it had postponed the decision on the federal permit of the project, from which it would not conduct studies of possible alternative routes that would not be able to interfere with the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogalla water layer, a large underground water supply.
"This is really a move forward," said Republican deputy Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the State Department would probably postpone any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after the next year’s elections, but the authorities refuse that politics would play a role in the decision.
In his written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile pipe will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the Albert province to the refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow through it daily.
That way, six states will have to be crossed.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work crews that estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on the pipeline.
However, Nebraska’s lawmakers opposed this plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and in the Ogalla water layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but the source from the energy industry said that the Inspector General of the Ministry had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study and focused mainly on two issues.
One was whether the lobbyist employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, was a conflict of interest in the program.
Another was whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making a toddler throw up in fear.
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The performance of the singer hit "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," claims her family in a lawsuit brought to Manhattan's Supreme Court.
On November 10, last year, stage engineer Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk met with her luggage down to the lobby of their house in Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a minute and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle irritably reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking dirty - screaming loudly the rudest words...
She had a bottle of water on her and she started splashing water at me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I told that woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort, who then dragged her to the waiting car, testified Roseanna Monk.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so much, she threw up, she delivered.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but they did not receive any answers.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesman are not responding to our calls to comment on the whole case.
The prosecution calls for more specific damages, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity organization dedicated to children with cancer.
"The aim is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate Disaster Slowed the Economy
During the first year of the reign of Maria López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and the economy with them
This is the first year of the reign of Maria López Valdez, which is called the government of change itself, which has brought great expectations in terms of economic progress, but no growth was recorded due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, and even the main indicators of economic development were reduced.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the possibilities for growth in the state economy, resulting in a reduction in economic activity of 3.6% in the first semester of this year.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded at 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, 78.03% of which were completely destroyed and 21.07% were found to be partial damage.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise and reached 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, Director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on actions taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors, including loss of market liquidity due to the reduction of resources due to legislation approved by Congress in the context of the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn, invest or use it for something," he emphasized.
Stopping Migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both because of difficult entry and then because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. People therefore remain and demand a job from our state, and thus unemployment is growing", he said.
Unreliability
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed people in the state work without paying social security benefits.
Other features of the labour market, such as low salaries, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are from all over the country, as reported by the registries of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour Secretariat and social planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas until September, far below the national average, which is 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in 2011 has also been recorded in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697 between January and June, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5, 143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the Government of the State lists investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million pesos. By November, no debt gains were recorded in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Mario López Valdés, pointed to a lack of governance.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 the will of individual sectors, including the government itself, was missing.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small this year. We need to work hard to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012, we need to double our efforts, we lack harmonisation of all our efforts and, in particular, the correct and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully, next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López said that events such as frost at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and reduced its development and growth.
"Weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism that would enable us to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. That is why at the end of the year we found ourselves well below the expected forecasts", he said.
Re-defining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state must be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we see that work is being done; we believe that a long-term plan must be prepared in which the goals and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important that all the potential material and human resources that Sinaloa has be mobilised," he said.
The Work That Is Before Us
Chairman Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better manage the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there have been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to establish a long-term plan", he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress with regard to the conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
The resident of Navolo was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 on an errand in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in El Castillo district, Callovo.
The dealer drove in a truck of pick up white color. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and in the passenger seat a small backpack. Soldiers found 8 kilos 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the second department and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Realisation of the Legal Impacts of Crimes.
It owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, the Rescue of Public Locations and 3x1 for migrants, are at risk of not being reached to the end or of being very late due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
According to the director of urban social development, if construction works have progressed so far, there is now a risk that the government of the state will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state is 25%. Until this time only the Federation and the city have provided the resources for the work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of the projects.
"They are supposed to secure almost 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we received nothing at all. Even though we were supposed to get a part of it already in July," he said. "To avoid wasting time, we started projects and continued very successfully, but we lack money".
He stated that last year, for the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state failed to meet the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to ask for a loan to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order to get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to obtain funds to cover what the state had not completed," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise by state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that an application was sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary for Administration and Finance, to speed up the proceedings and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They should have provided us with 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even received a peso yet".
The Court approves the "end of analogous broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the President Decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "off analogous signals" and implement it instead of 2021 in 2015.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mez, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree stating the individual steps that would lead to the transition to Earth's digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected because the qualified majority of eight votes required to be heard by the court on the constitutional or non-constitutionality of the decree, which thus remains valid, was not reached.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare a decree unconstitutional because regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter which is legally reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero herself voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein, leading to the transition to digitisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the proposal that Minister Sánchez Cordero is also in charge of.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that a federal executive could not structure measures to prepare the public administration through general standards.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority", and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of a federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analogous signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years. It has to do with better use of radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions on public interest, because digitization has not only a technical dimension, but "it also affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these questions "require the operation of the entire system in place, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, which includes a number of competences entrusted to the Constitution by the Government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a non-conflict decree which, to some extent, interferes with the area of powers of Congress, to introduce compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers into the area of administration.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to the figures published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and the votes of 879 of 6074 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
The possibility of adding "vote after vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacan, where, in line with the figures published by the PRAP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election was less than 27 percent, and the votes of 879 of the 6074 districts were not yet counted.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Authority approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be pointed out, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Law on Electoral Justice, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire during this parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has neglected their publication within the prescribed time limit in the Official State Gazette Act, with his objections to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state's voice on constitutional reforms to be "valid and illegal" because it has no right to 'or approve or veto' them.
María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied on the question of the possibility of adding "voice by voice" to the census, that the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM would enable the local electoral authority to carry out both a partial and a total census.
In this way, a partial census of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of the census and calculation in the relevant box or the President does not have it at his disposal; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of electoral results.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all ballots will be possible if there is evidence suggesting that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an express request from the party representative and/or the coalition proposed by the candidate in the second place appears at the beginning of the session.
A total recount of the votes will also be possible if, after a proper census, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate ended in second place.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been added up.
His will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé, confirmed by the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé.
After having received the highest honors along with the others who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortese family returned to Coahuila, the capital, on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., there was a farewell at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, organized by his former high school students and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined the flight school Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as he did when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo".
The young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán for his uncle’s graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he liked best in his life: driving an airplane.
They gave him one last good-bye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we parted with all the honours that came to him to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the Saltillo Technology High School, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in the studio and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after a helicopter crashed, which he was driving. On board was also the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and another six persons, all officials of that state.
At 18:05, the remains of Saltillen’s native Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be handed over through the funeral service to Mexican air forces under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez on the grounds where the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the farm Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the findings, military officials introduced 11 persons to the media who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting at various parts of the body and head were found at the abandoned farmhouse of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 kilometers of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the hut with the beige-coffee fence had a door open from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants, and there were no shoes on. Next to him, a man was also in a white striped sports shirt.
A few meters further, another person’s body was found dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were lying face-down.
According to the data collected at the scene, all three persons were probably murdered in another location because no bullets were found.
Messages were found on the hut fence addressed by one group of organized crime others and also a number of bullet tracks, both at the building and at the door.
There were 11 suspects in Cadereyta.
The Secretary of National Defense introduced 11 people, including teenagers, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, persecutions and illegal burials.
According to the information published in the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 people were detained and managed to free one detainee.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, confirming they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The next raid took place on 12 November at 6 o'clock. Military staff was on a patrol in Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when he noticed a car without a license plate and in it two persons.
After stopping the car, they did a search and discovered one rifle, a shell casing, and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was arrested on 13 November at around 14 o’clock. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country at the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country at risk from economic disaster and putting the entire eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the President with the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult stage," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has led to an unsustainable level of debt.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough package of austerity measures required by European leaders, which will be the only way to restore Italy's damaged credibility.
There's a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry up, and because of the instability of the markets, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of 7 percentage points exceeded the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told journalists after meeting with Monti: 'We said we would be very supportive of this government'.
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this pressing situation.
Monti’s hopes of success have multiplied considerably thanks to the support from PDL Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," said Angelina Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, to journalists.
Support for PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now, a number of its members have opposed the government with the technocratic majority that Monti is building.
Parliament support
The new Monti government must have strong support from Parliament in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti’s failure could be catastrophic.
Monti started negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women’s organisations on Monday.
The round will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed president of Napolitan on Sunday, which allowed very rapid action in response to the crisis.
After a brief drop from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, the interest on Italian bonds returned to a critical threshold, thus responding to the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is 1.8 trillion euro, would be beyond the scope of the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti said that his government should remain in power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians would only give him time to reform and then declare early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has reached due to financial pressure.
Political sources have said that mutual distrust and disapproval between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate political personalities into the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish football players, ten will cross the 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 players called reached the number of 50 matches.
Huge contrast on the Costa Rica side if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly game at the National Stadium in San José at 3:05.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA’s monthly ratings, have a wide range of Class A inter-selection matches, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman’s defenseman, who was the only one to play 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday at the game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Stars and Mighty Clubs of the English First League, have maintained intense activity in league championships and home cups and high-level matches within European Cups such as the Champions League for over a year.
We must also add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches for the European and world championships to the previous one.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited possibilities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representation is in the account of goaltender Iker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (lost 0-1 in London) made it to former goaltender Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will take on Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 games on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were officially announced last week by UEFA together with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account. Among them mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the medium attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol, with 97 matches, came close to the 100.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and close to Michael Uman are moving left wing Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goaltender Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 crossed the line of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of games.
With less than 30 matches in Spain there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández, and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of celebrating 20 years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bass player Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what the bassist and founding member of Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day he will perform at the National Stadium at 7:30, along with the angelic band The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example from an interview, whose entire transcription can be found on the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican supporters, it's a dream come true.
The trip to Costa Rica is also our dream that is coming true.
We've barely been in South and Central America a second time, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can spend a few days here.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally love the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your sharpest supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took us so long.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is that putting more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've done in the last 21 years were made over a period of weeks.
We did some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we got in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle, for both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and her surf waves?
We have a lot of surfers' friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, which is the best place to surf, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a great show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there's no limit to what we can't do.
We will try to perform the best possible show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given and we are moved to continue playing together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the origin of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which all the greats are represented.
The Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it does not happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and second of all, the fact that we're constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends, and thanks to that we have managed to open up musical paths that allow everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy, but thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find your balance?
As we grew, it became easier and easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remind yourself that you have to respect music and what you gave her, and you can't let yourself get carried away by being famous, rock stars, and neither of us ever really cared about that.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first, it was something spectacular.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released an album until after Andy Woods died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be assigned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as openings?
Yes, production has sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are wondering what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's an Ed question, so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's adding the first thing to his mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
The first thing I can think of is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I could talk all night about bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to hold the grunge even though it's no longer in style?
I think we've all always felt slightly separated from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I think of the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came into existence at the same time, and if music is so valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever.
At the beginning, your music had a slightly bleak character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting, because I feel that there are a few songs in the new album that are easier to play, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very bleak, although they may sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or your boyfriend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in the lower extremities, informed by his attending physician.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is currently under medical control.
A fellow Member of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the television station Canal N that Fujimori will be undergoing tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he is in pain and why he is losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could get mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times because of tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and other disorders such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in his legs were added to these problems, named by the doctor.
Fujimori has served his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons killed by a murderous squadron of troops acting illegally in the first years of his reign.
Mujica visiting Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of large-scale visits with political, business and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries", published the Uruguay presidential office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay’s dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy put South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community, and this statement gave rise to a rejection from Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to define fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the 'blacklist' of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), on which countries are on which they have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have had a free trade agreement (FTA) concluded since 2004, which increased the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in the "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, has been created from the beginning to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said a press officer specializing in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of a video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because until now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokeswoman said that in addition to the fact that the image is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can go to the "second round" at the levels of the game that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome all kinds of challenges and "do not succumb to optical delusions".
This new Super Maria arrival in 3D also assumes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this Nintendo video game, he plays to the tunes of those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous episodes. It is that the bearded man’s plumber will have to pass through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in surroundings, in disguises and also among the enemies, he also appears "playful" Luigi.
Colom has approved Portilla's release to the United States.
On Tuesday, President Álvaro Colom announced that he had made progress on the issue of former President Alfons Portillo, to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process for Guatemala to respond at the request of the northern country requesting the extradition of Portilla in order to judge him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he was aware that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured himself that, during his mandate, he had not intervened in court decisions and allowed all the extraditions that had come to his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means a step in execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead the trial against the former president who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million at the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency. This trial preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and brought the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6000 young in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not find themselves on the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened with social exclusion have been helped, and for 25 years the organization has helped them to overcome difficult situations.
To this end, it is necessary to add the long 100 jobs acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance in the ceremonial act, which took place in the former production premises of the Fabra and Coats factory, with more than 300 participants.
Trinijove was founded in the District of Trinity Vella in 1986 to help young people with low education, jobless, drug addiction, or social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreo was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that worked with the association in the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, in election time, has shown the uniform nature of the work that Trinijove is doing.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current ecological-socialist councillor Ricard Goma, attended the ceremony.
The Grand Hall of Fabra and Coats was also attended by the current social welfare and family advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the CEO of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created in a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day, "is a good foundation".
The President introduced Trinijove as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was an eviction of an occupied house where giant parties were held
Intruders took 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the number 51 neighbors on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, illegally inhabited and organized giant parties that woke the neighbors, leaving the building under court orders and without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the warden.
The occupations who occupied 11 of the 13 flats in the building - the remaining ones are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water equipment, in addition they painted walls and left behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties took place in the first three apartments, which lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that, while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco points out that the occupation of the building made it unfairly competitive because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while it costs 10 at the disco.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbors’ noise lawsuits. However, the problems were not caused by discos, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially by those who participated in the organized parties, whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the upset inhabitants of the surrounding area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she has forgiven her rent.
City police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from their neighbors over the past few weeks about the situation.
Last week, the chair of the PP People's Party at City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded that "the building be immediately evicted and put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area".
The chair of the People’s Party explained that only one floor was taken a year ago, but in recent months, the occupations had reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments and even thefts occurred in one of them.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to actions against civil responsibility that have taken place in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared out the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock, 30 minutes, police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four of them were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of a procedure that carries more than controversy about fees
The municipal tender for 16 gates again opens up a debate about the role of Collserola park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the already extinct corporation Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets to support Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of Metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalonian capital is one of the few that are not oriented north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualifications as a natural park go that way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with boars instead of Yogi Bear.
This was the position until September when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate is recording the idea of the park.
It's either this or someone's trying to place the gate on the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and on the basis of a reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It's already a subject as fresh as when two members of this old caste of the chosen ones shake hands at the meeting in the elevator.
And it was this act that triggered one of the rare matches between what the three Barcelona architects and the preeminent university professors think.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender has its merits.
According to Roldán, after the question of the bay side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefons Cerd's speech on green apples was not reached to the end.
"We must base ourselves on the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Amongst other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect for whom the name "gates to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as defining zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers".
The danger resulting from the "uncertainty presented today by the project of the public place" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the Forum area "its swan singing".
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something means to take the next step", that is, basically, to move on.
"It is necessary to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
If we look more closely at the question, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be "considered as a park", but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "can't end up in a dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its grémium, that it will intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a sort of pass allowing architects to engage in the debate, but "doubts", that it should be this technical profile, which will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", adds), which must be created: "Architekti should only be tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question given by the name of this game is complex, because there is no global vision of Collserol in the tender documentation: "16 competitions have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
This causes at least him to sign up for all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may refer to the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the City Hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the equipment zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardons Jonah Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, legal agent Cadino Red granted his brother Mayor Monterrey a pardon in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal agent Casino Red has pardoned him in front of the Second Criminal Court in the district, which was discussing the case of extortion in which Mayor Monterrey's brother was accused.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonás should have asked him to pay for the economic quota to allow Monterrey City Hall to allow illegal operations in the betting house.
After a public indictment, the State Prosecutor initiated a criminal prosecution against a brother of the Panistic Mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then after 4 hours spent in front of Public Ministry Agent No.3 for Property Crimes he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antigua in the capital city of the state.
He remained in this place for the next 49 days after the second prison order was passed and the Public Ministry agent disproved the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing owners of Casino Red with an amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he stayed only a few hours in a prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to remain in San Nicolás de los Garza city cells during the trial.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant issued by Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence was collected to prove Jonah’s guilt.
This Monday, the legal agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for a pardon for his brother, the mayor of the region.
During the legal proceedings, a representative of the Public Ministry appointed to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez if the damage had been corrected and who of the associates decided to grant the pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazabal. In the trial against him, no complaint will be possible. Nor can it be claimed that the damage or punishment could be compensated.
After trial with a legal agent around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the San Nicolás de los Garza prison to announce to Jonah that he had been granted official pardon and his case was postponed in the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order to release him.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details of the plane crash that killed the Governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident investigation in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven others died show that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, said that before the start of the aircraft the pilot stated that climate conditions allow flight.
"Parts that appear suggest that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings are entangled in the tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull".
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, so it met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the field of impact.
"When searching, it was found that the parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the mainland as integral.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, managing director of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at a cruise speed and the accident occurred on a soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a routine overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jacome listed six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at take-off, according to which the aircraft moves towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Impact location.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar match, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the trajectory of the flight prior to the impact.
Dissipation of aircraft residues in restricted territory:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A diagram of the dispersal of the aircraft remains indicates that the helicopter was complete at the time of the impact on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence of an explosion or fire at the scene of the accident.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During off-road work, aircraft remains were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloped, the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage of the likely breakdown along the route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search around the accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the designated area, no remains of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still solid.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has begun researching the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it conducts research to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. A research called "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Teens" will enable the results of overweight.
In a report by the head of the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Center of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every Saturday from 8 o'clock will be tested for minors.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and since 8 October this activity is also carried out at the Zahualcóyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to trace risk factors to Mexican children and young people and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined every Saturday, and genes are examined (trying to identify genes involved in childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals over the alarming increase in child weight.
'The health polls carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that only six years later boys had a 77% increase in obesity and 47% increase in girls. A dramatic increase was also seen in the case of overweight', said an expert from IMSS.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators was the assumption that the population of the country differed from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetics, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes that are responsible for developing diabetes and overweight.
He explained that general obesity genetics are commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thus establishing whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of wrinkles of dark color (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the probability that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-sugar conditions.
So far, the information is confidential, it is handed over by doctors to parents in writing and explained to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes that they need to make in order to avoid disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life, meaning a lack of daily physical activity, a day’s sitting in front of television and the use of means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight also causes large caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in Asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty of UNAM creates modified asphalt with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the paving was properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Region, Rafael Herrera Najer, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt tiles were adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the technological cause of the potholes he made during the International Year of Chemistry announced that the laboratory under his leadership was developing modified asphalt with polymers, which should create a mixture of similar characteristics to asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing pothole formation.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the formation of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with large molecular weights called asphalt, and others with low molecular weights called mortars. Together, they give asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it acts as a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, warned the expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist at the Chemical Faculty observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt insert, made up of small stones embedded in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that makes up the insert is covered with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure it is so possible that the forces in the pavement are well decomposed.
If it were modified asphalt, they would have decomposed even better, thinks a chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer called the cape, made up of fine stones, also covered in asphalt, is placed on the asphalt insert.
As this layer will come into contact with the vehicle rims, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt liner and ensure friction of the road.
As a part of the paving, it will be exposed to heavy loads, it must have sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially moisture and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to bear in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt liner.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads in and it's hard to get out, it causes softening of all layers of the pavement and thus creating potholes.
He explained that during the construction of potholes, the first film of the casing will be damaged and only then the asphalt liner will be damaged. However, the damage does not occur in one moment, but it is a slow process that should be stopped at the first stamps using suitable maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load of vehicles and it must be ensured that this load will not be exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries and allow us to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombian?
Analyses of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus gets the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has not reached the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, she gained a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multimiss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's Cartagena final, which won and the scepter took over Miss Atlántico, the department in question won the 14th title of the first multimiss. Melina joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca, who reached the reach of the winning crown, but eventually were declared by the first moremiss. These included Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1988), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the great favorite, who has shown in all previous rounds that she has the ability to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only First Multimiss is the fact that it did not convince its answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?" by Martín Murillo Gómez from the literary editor Leamos.
The candidate answered the question:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
I'm currently reading "Crime and Punishment." It's a book that we should all know about worldwide literature, and today I have a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author, called "El Ardor de la Sangre".
This response was displeased because of the term "culture" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain to her what the individual books mentioned made her notice.
At the end of the ceremony Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise what is to happen, it will happen.
And you people, read, if you can, the little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
Bogot journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, most celebrated, and the one who took away all the previous prizes (The Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the public title for the best artistic dress and Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned on the scene.
It was evident during the first presentation of the swimwear on Hilton Beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Although it was shining on both of them, it was known that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the Canal RCN programme, believes that Melinda's first multimiss title confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up leaving with the crown of the Queen".
Moreover, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude toward the media in recent days, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
On the outside, two days before Lucy Doughty's election, an international jury member said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia pageant, beauty itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feeling. It is important for candidates to be involved in such projects before they enter the competition", she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was evident on the bottom. However, this is quite contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her Miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on her butt, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took her points off until the last day".
Meanwhile, a journalist named Guido Hoyos, of Cromos magazine, believes that a native of Valle made a mistake in undergoing several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valla.
The body was never her strong suit and here it took its toll".
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, there was a cruel prediction that came true after the bathing suit show. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo allowed Melina not to have to give her the highest crown in the end.
Whether it's true or not, it is certain that Melina has begun her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be appointed the National Competition itself.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the striking success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of a Cali resident who identified Alfons Cane's corpse.
The fingerprint expert from Cali went into history as the man who confirmed Alfonso Cana's death.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th of last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: "Alphonse Cana" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at CTI this week, Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejad, has been working in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital city of Valle and after taking the relevant courses, he began specializing in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. palms and legs.
In the week of the operation against the said Alfons Cane, Eliaszar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmiro.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to take a fingerprint card from Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it because of physical appearances.
He didn't have a beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, ink and transplanter and light, Eliaszar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse to the card entries.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he really was the supreme commander of Farc.
Track Search
For the Sijin de Cali dactyloscope, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, these people help research crimes like theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present fake IDs or don't have papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall, because in this place the thief leaned on to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to get a whole hand print and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicion in a murder case.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation revealed that one of the family members might be responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although there's no way to confirm that he really was a killer, it's obvious that he appeared on the scene of a crime.
The fingerprint expert from CTI explained that the objects are "marked with chemical or physical reactive substances".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to collect them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not recorded anywhere", said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it turns out in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that sparkles, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there's traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Indignation" protests in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were confined to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square, where they were brought out this morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestants were confined to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allowed the "indignant" to return to camp. The second part of the movement responded to the evacuation by taking up the park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle in order to return to Zuccotti, both through assembly and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the movement "Obsadíjte Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray made it clear that the answer to the "indignant" to the eviction of the camp, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had come to trial where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the site and allowing the manifestos to continue camping.
In addition, the "indignation" also took up another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the rectory in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to take the place, but then the police came and intercepted some of the manifestants. Bray did not know the exact number, but said that he saw that they had placed the handcuffs on some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on site, and a delegation of religious leaders has also come to express their support and try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday and during which the lawfulness of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestants even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave it to members who were guarding the square, which triggered "some small clashes", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers had beaten the manifestants.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or from applying "laws which were published after the commission began, or from prohibiting manifestos from accessing the park with shops or other places previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of public space and the manifestos have pointed out that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's senior official personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and approached because the manifestos "broken the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it became "a place where people didn't go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases hurt others" because "some shops got threatening letters" and "neighbors feared for the quality of their lives".
"The early clean-up was appalling, and it shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added the spokesman of a movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they plan to organize "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months after which the protests lasted, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will present Our Lady on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he appears in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a lifeguard in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", the wife of a rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show in Canadian TV.
The private TV station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will embody the Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV shows footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet home pornographic films, appears with his ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, like the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in the nursery.
As Josef, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, will appear on the scene, who has recently served as host to the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer Bublé appears in the special Christmas broadcast of CTV, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a fox at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is rising by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus ends the period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September was placed in such a position that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - anticipate the greatest growth rate compared to January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines needed to restore earthquake - destroyed areas and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses have increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of Japan’s economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it stronger or to rebuild the infrastructure, and this is about taking advantage of the lack to start from scratch.
Japan has awakened, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, travels and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when the yen - Japanese currency - became one of the 'saving values' for investors who run from the eurozone debt crisis and from the worrying US forecasts.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to September at the Yen course.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We must look out for the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen", said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts inflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even got below the average, which is at 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens Again Spreads Insecurity
Papadimos says austerity will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that once again prevailed, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in the labyrinth, which leads to an exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "congruent" of the new transitional Greek government is given to the requirements of Brussels rather than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms, and that the 100-day period he received when he was appointed would probably be short for their application, President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that he would in no way support the new austerity measures and repeated his request to launch the new elections on the expected date of 19 February.
'The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October', said Papadimos yesterday during the parliamentary debate, culminating tomorrow in a vote on government confidence.
The package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not clarify any doubts about his position: 'We have committed ourselves to helping a transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else'.
The President of the Conservatives went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF, which are supposed to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but he also stated that he would not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
Yesterday, the European Commission, already angry with the impact that Papandre’s referendum games have caused, stressed that its demands are inextricable: it will not block any aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties do not sign a 'written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible'.
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and will discuss with the new government "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of $8 billion.
The Greek launderette still has a little more to knit with.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain’s privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain 'has achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance'.
Queen Sofia reminded yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is 'that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man'.
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th global micro-loans summit in Valladolid, believing that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the objectives to achieve a reduction by half of the number of people who live with less than one dollar per day, the amount that sets the threshold of poverty".
Spain 'will continue to work' and expand the network of volunteers 'in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly', stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, 'will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women, to which these loans are intended in particular.
'We have achieved a great deal' and 'many challenges are still ahead of us'.
The micro-loans summit is supposed to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after "the pioneer of Muhammad Yunus' idea went on this journey", said the Queen and added that it was an act of justice and the necessary recognition.
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who set out on the road to combat poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted with his lending policy on the spot.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to see a constant development, the queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned her the title of "head of the family", which was awarded her in Valladolid "movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia ended her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thereby allowing them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balohobyte, because this cooperation is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microloans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success of the concept of giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor Valladolidu, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city, which "opens its gates to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
The CDU proposes to vote for the European President on the basis of universal electoral law
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU) Congress took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and Chair of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until autumn, in particular to satisfy the party members who consider the government's policy today to the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow to the Italians as lax.
The proposal on the President of the European Commission by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
Several minutes of standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel's speech and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan: the answer to the crisis is 'not less Europe, but more Europe'.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time for change has come".
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon enabling the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal electoral law 'to give Europe one face'.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the Congress's proposal, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom opposes, and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, the delegates rejected, by a large majority, the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the European Central Bank’s Board of Directors, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in Germany’s weight strengthening.
The Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to get the congress to talk about "small" European states or states in difficulty, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, a bloody battle was taking place at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud in incapacity for work represent?
Following the aid, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will address a speech on the topic of combating social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incompetence.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of incapacity before they start taking disease support.
Clearly, without the company's consent, an employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring about 280 million euros.
Also, a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic scope: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority also launches the theme of fraud aimed at this time at mischief linked to work incompetence.
"Controls will be much more extensive and additionally: if you are caught, you will return", warned Xavier Bertrand in an interview provided by RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about iniquities in work incapacity.
In fact, they have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political strains that have produced their fruitage.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladia (CNAM) more than EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, daily compensation, with its 11.3 billion euro, accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
Of this amount, 46% were about maternal contributions and accidents at work, and 54% were about incapacity for work, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
So only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average of some deviations: another poll published in 2007 at Monster.com’s job opportunities website showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed replied that it had not chosen any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of work incapacity was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to incompetence than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or not) in France oscillated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in incompetence is only a very small part compared to working black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused systematic checks to be carried out on incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM stated that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term inability to "unlicensed or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetences longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "non-adapted or unauthorised" were counted to 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "illegal" cases for several million employees who had incapacity for work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing black work.
According to Mr Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would amount to 9 to 15 billion euro missing from tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words before Parliament and added that a hundred days of unity given to his government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
'We need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget plan', said the Prime Minister when he delivered his first public speech on Wednesday in opening the debate to vote on trust in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit will be the 'main task' of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is at stake, added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "in the vicinity of 9%" of the gross domestic product from now to the end of 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for an already approved measure in order to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party did not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hands for any new measures," Samaras emphasized at the meeting with Members on behalf of his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economics and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Panel of Experts
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, health institutions, and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the Government amend criminal law in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quote the recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada has placed 10th place, the study notes that "the medidicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in a hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is highest with 86% of the deceased in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report draw conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also controlled all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons not competent or dissenting.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than numerous cases of these missteps yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is also done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians Beneath Euthanasia
Let us recall that, according to an inquiry conducted by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the life of elderly or handicapped persons is worth less.
With regard to those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those questioned consider that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear about maintaining or interrupting care for the patient, says the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that criminal law should state that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also requires professional doctors to be educated to respect rejection of treatment at the end of their lives without fearing prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires that governments, health institutions, and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final appeasement already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission demands that it be considered euthanasia when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report by experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signatories of the report as "extreme", inter alia, because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who was tired of life and who had more than 18 years could ask to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé reports yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
The medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society herself, doubts in particular the data of the report on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the state of Oregon.
Jordan’s king calls President Assad to resign
Damascus is talking about "competition"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The followers of Bashar al-Assad showed up at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists them and talks about "competition" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership of the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the countries neighbouring Syria, have taken a position in favour of President Assad’s departure.
Yesterday, Jordan's King Abdallah II was the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to kill in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed," he gave power.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a country adjacent to Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
On behalf of his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts made by the Turkish mediation of the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year were not crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is increasingly pursuing a tougher line.
The United States rejoiced in the "enhancing consensus against Assad and the dishonest conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are increasingly applying a harsher tone" against repression in Syria, remarked Mark Toner, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilians died"in the shootouts and concentrated shooting from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
At a press conference, however, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualle estimated that the country had "set out of the crisis".
After all, he responded vividly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus's membership, which, according to him, is a "dangerous move".
Syria "will not bow", he added with assurance that "competitions plot against Syria will not succeed".
After its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "civil protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favourably in favour of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime which he believes is "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League is called for tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the resolution plan for the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which was supposed to specifically withdraw armies from cities plagued by disputes and the liberation of imprisoned manifestos.
Yesterday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the Arab League's decision "mistakeable", while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice from the Italians
The next Italian government chief Mario Monti has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start applying a program that contains "victims" in order to regain credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with political parties before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should build a relatively slim cabinet consisting of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the nominated Prime Minister.
The President of the House of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express his confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness of the financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy, the exact terms apply" as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, stressed and added that it is "sure that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially accepted by the markets, but his concern reappeared after the unexpected September decline in industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should put together a team involving mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to adopt "politics" in it.
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the next election date.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti, after taking up his duties, promised to act with extreme urgency and in order to make Italy a strong link again to Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union believes that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria's head Emma Marcegagli, who meets Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy", for a country that does not show growth cannot comply with deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, a "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, the "call for seriousness" and "other Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The time of his team's life will be a great unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place the government bonds for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
A Soviet scientist helped Iran’s nuclear program
The Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop an atomic weapon detonator, announced on Tuesday an American NGO specialized in atomic risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from this UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA announced its "serious concern" as regards the possible military dimension of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute, a widely drawn IAEA document by V. Danilenko (born 1934), he was to work at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the Centre to set up a business in Kiev producing "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was then to cooperate on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest IAEA report, it recalls "clear data that the development of Iran's detonation system" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked on this technology during a substantial part of his career as part of the military nuclear programme of the country from which he came".
Anti-Muslim crime and delinquency increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and offences against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or slightly increased.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to a 13% increase in anti-Catholic violence, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews, and a total increase of 14% in anti-religious crime and delinquency.
The total number of "hatred crimes" rose very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences rise again", stressed Human rights First, "the increase of anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", she added in her communication.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leaders of Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these misdeeds", adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "hatred crime".
"Hate crime" in U.S. federal law is the legacy of civil rights.
This rule of law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The Twitter microblogging service website introduced design changes on Monday to enable its users to observe the activities of its successors, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New offers of "activity" and "name" enable you to better and directly know the activities of other people who are following you or those whose answers ("tweets") are monitored by you.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor posts, whether they are entering new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested"to a small percentage of users in August" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, she told AFP Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre usilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ansi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comprehensive a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" assess the importance of this innovation differently.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook," says @jemb123.
"Activity will help me follow some of the elements of my Twitter", sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
entering the golden rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to put the 'golden rule' of budgetary policy in a constitution in order to reduce the public deficit in order to avoid any reduction in Austria's ratings by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where Austrian public debt, with its 74.6% high above the criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement, is at most 60% lower than those of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by just one step from AAA to AAA+, we would have to pay three billion more euros each year", argued the Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows up on the request of the summit of the euro area countries held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State or Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 a reduction in the public deficit and a balance of public accounts be entered in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the 'German model', Germany was the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting with 2017, the federal public structural deficit will have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder and municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 period.

Noda threatens new interventions on foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again on the foreign exchange markets if only he had to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did last, if we find excessive volatility" at the exchange rate of the yen, explained to Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, it just rose again to historical values that forced Japan’s authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of Japan’s currency, which only recently broke the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has it been regularly supported by purchases of investors who consider it a 'safe port' in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar was once again under 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues obtained by Japanese foreign companies when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that devastated the Totoku region in the northeast of the country, emphasized Y. Noda, who is afraid that this increase in price will not kill the yen in the egg's fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in relation to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of growth in exports and consumption of households burdened with disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
Japan’s finance minister Jun Azumi called on Japan’s central bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the multi-governor of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Issues increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euro) and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Euro area:
Rates are rising, stock markets are failing.
The risk of a debt crisis still undermines European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European exchanges still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris at 10 o'clock the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions around the yields of euro area loans in difficulty, the stock markets around the world continue to yield only part of the recent profits".
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, a broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closing with a drop of 0.7%, which was suffered due to the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 when it retreats by 0.4%.
According to the currency brokers, after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU adopted a proposal at her congress on Monday to leave the eurozone for countries in difficulty without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of decisions taken on 27 October at the eurozone summit would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when elections to the House of Deputies are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("Spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting euro area growth figures
Statistical figures say that France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies of INSEE revised downwards figures for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that concerns economists the most.
On its side, Germany registered an increase of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 o'clock, while the European Commission has just drawn attention to the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must triumph over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that occupies energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will trigger a duplication of electricity demand by 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of an important part of life.
At the same time, a lack of fossil resources will need to be faced in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
An accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains itself in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case with Belgium, which submits its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which it considers correct to build only the power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island disaster.
If the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts that.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on gas imported mainly from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
European champion in wind power plants, of which 30% of its electricity is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65% or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay our electricity bill 40% higher than the payment made by French households.
While energy costs in a globalised economy are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the most cheap electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us remind you that our country's energy policy has enabled the sector to stand up to 125,000 direct jobs and 41,000 downstream jobs.
The strongly exporting sector is dragging a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lost 6 billion euros a year that the country receives for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while its manufacturer was scheduled to fail?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for producing energy, even that there is no diabolical.
The development of low-CO2 emissions installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
Fifty years later, the nuclear industry experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place under normal traffic conditions and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl drama caused the concept of the reactor and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident as it did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear security authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the competitors of AREVA and EDF and by releasing the way to take over the leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the engulfing of police, courts and administrations subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the 'human rights country', which France boasts.
Recently it was administrative harassment, the subject of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of the Interior (see the letter Libération of 23 May) said that France "does not need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at an economic angle.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
To the right, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where 2 million immigrant workers are located" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of invasion of the hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps immigrants are perceived as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the level of generosity that we are willing to give to immigrants.
In its programme François Hollande is limited to banalities when it states that joint development will enable us to solve our 'migration problem'.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be true in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and harms employment.
The concerns about the effects of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitute workers for French workers by performing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
A Positive Effect on Wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these additions between the French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that growth in migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
However, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were established by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average, in the amount of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany, one immigrant who is 30 years of age will bring a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets for his entire life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish to go for the missing percentage of growth "with the dented teeth".
The teeth used to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we have to think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and very fragile.
The European continent should remember this, even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the XXth century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that it would be enough to make a choice and make it in the most direct way possible for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies.
But it has been known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General electoral law, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient and can become a "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control by power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic one, but it is just as it is and since the start of the crisis in politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of a yes-no Greek referendum will have the value of double disclosure in this regard: exposing the need for a great return to political power, but also exposing the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be designed to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to the necessity and disorganised.
A blank exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a leap with its legs tied to the empty nationalist depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would no longer know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe bowing down to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it every one of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty must urgently be restored.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the rule of the markets and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will anticipate decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this Socialist and Jacques Delors proposal, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to be Republicans.
A revolution of interest couldn't have been enough.
This lesson is still valid.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a Europe of more political democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere on Tuesday at Villepinte near Paris, the world trade fair of chip cards will open.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% on more than 6 billion units in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones).
The most significant is the segment of contactless technology, which allows to pay in public transport or deal with purchases by simply zooming the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold one year earlier!
Their share should still rise in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After being on the APEC for a long time, Europe gets the terrain in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard contactless cards this year.
In order to include a higher gear, it is necessary for banks to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future", announces Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
The banks are testing their cell phone payments.
But this is only the first stage to the payment means of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary for carrying out transactions is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They're running late."
"But their real expansion should take place next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their sales in the world of 80 to 120 million units", explains Marc Bertin, President of EuroSmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, Société générale announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are ties between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Mesahel even admitted that Algiers had been "sure" about this from now on.
"The way in which both organisations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them", he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help to illuminate the bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation conducted by special French forces.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of calls carried out leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long resided in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and sect.
"This is progress, but we must no doubt wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram".
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more obvious in the development and expression of Boko Haram or in its operating procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community has put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little value.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is a sin", approves the founding of the Islamic Emirates in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
Such a connection has a rapid success in this poor region.
The sect is politicized and requires strict respect for the Islamic law of sharia, while its supporters begin the fight against the 'central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and authorities.
In 2009, supporters of Boko Haram became extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government's response is still the same.
The army surrounds the city and results in 800 deaths.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf sect is captured and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group radicalizes and leaves their assignments in the north.
At Christmas 2010, Jos will assassinate 80 people, then another in Abuja, the capital.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the United Nations local office will be the first international target.
From now on, the creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, concerns all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda has encircled the Islamic Maghreb, Mali and the Iger and Somalis from the Al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in a state of alert and ready to "pass all information".
The world according to candidates for president
On issues related to China, Iran, or Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are overcoming simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated the hazing statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or Israel come together.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican "Grand Old Party" nomination race, threatened the Chinese's profession before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "for manipulation of their currency", which is a supporting topic in America, with the ravaged migration of entire parts of its industry towards Asia.
The worse, if this must contain the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's ambassador to China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost got stuck in an attitude that "kills" emotions.
It required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (currently President Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who is at the last polling points, remains insubordinate.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop his nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in Fanfaron.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military aid, accusing Obama of failing in his duties toward this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, because Beijing is trying to develop nuclear capabilities - clearly ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
They're all far away from Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple thoughts, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the 'boys' from Iraq, his excuses about Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of the weak
But the attack isn't easy.
The population is assessing President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to entanglement.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking in a more proper place.
Nord Stream, a new port of entry for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and led down the Baltic Sea has begun to operate.
It must deliver gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, among them four heads of state and government, participated in Nord Stream’s inauguration, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
The symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte have jointly turned the control around the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas will flow to Western Europe every year through the first 1 224 km pipeline connecting the Saint Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomorany.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the whole of French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route is already mentioned.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being led on the ground by a third State (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing a little bit of power: the possibility of pushing Russia through threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it is a politically sensitive topic.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created cracks between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia was able to assert its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us", confirmed François Fillon during the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated the point at which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The underwater pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete casing in order to protect it from anchors of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"For security reasons, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations at all.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were not eager to see the Russian state company permanently settling off their coasts.
"In case of a malfunction, we stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute", explains Jens Müller.
In case of leaks, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by builders, for welds were designed to create leaks once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline outside is checked by an underwater robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
In the finish line, 3 m/s will provide accurate information on any deformations of metal parts over the entire three days of the journey.
The remote pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom's leadership remains, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as Dutch company Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has its registered office in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its gas transport capacities to the company for five years by a contract that can be renewed.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of the actual gas being transported", explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholder and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, investment costs thus increased to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will come back to them, because Gazprom alone takes the risk.
The pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves of a height of 4.5 meters form an output gas gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - designer notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to rekindle the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular plates and its white leaves as if aged over time.
After all, Moleskin's notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan decides to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes up the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of the skin), which is used for example for surface adjustment of benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has returned to popularity an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XXth century", relates Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle on 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is remote from the secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to build an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook will impress the businessman as well as the student or professional.
The image of Moleskine's notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured, and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early years, has now had almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and through a chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the middle of cities where he could assert his identity.
"We have observed the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition " Zacházka", where architects or artists display their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also introduced new records of a notebook resembling a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is extended to a variety of carriers.
Success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006 Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of handicapped workers so high?
About 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
Today opens 15. Week for employing handicapped people.
Despite the electoral public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed handicapped persons is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it daunting?
"No, underscores Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adaptt Association, who organizes the Week for employing handicapped people."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that there are numerous obstacles for unemployed handicapped persons before their entry into work.
These are elderly: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% have no graduation and out of 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for handicapped people compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, founded in 1992, to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unsaid ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the questioned managers have a "weak level of knowledge about handicapped people" with an "exaggeration about people in wheelchairs and mental or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employing 6% of handicapped workers as laid down in the 1987 Law.
The last known numbers dating back to 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, charged with charging companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of" fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 more guilty enterprises to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro) between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before on Tuesday evening (20h45) inviting French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that would bring them this friendly match.
We're not going to go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but it's symbolic.
Sitting next to each other in the stands of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made up.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country".
"I want to move forward," assures the French player Lille.
When it comes to the difference between his performance in club games and national team matches, "it's one and the same, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Gambling against Romania on Thursday night because of this match against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "glove".
The term "joy" cannot be ignored.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he claims.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more so, because opposite are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", recalls.
"We crossed immediately."
"The power to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Kindly referred to Leekens as "proud."
"Proud" to fight the "wrestling" - a holiday.
"Proudness" also to say at the quality of the "neighbors", that France became a very high-level team a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014 heading... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he underlined.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next fights," including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism of the Bosnian Bosnian barrage (22h00).
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team, and above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
One game left to play and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's result (0-0) in Hell, the Bosnian Zenica seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour’s advantage, but it was unable to score such a rare goal that would relieve it.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score a goal outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisabona, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of an audience that should create a boiling boiler there, although the match certainly appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but a sharp thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being on Euro 2012", however, relativated the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for Bosnians who also need to score a goal.
"It is a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we did not score a goal outside", regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities", he added.
Just like in Zenici, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that they won't give them time to think."
A good idea, on condition that it turns out to be realistic this time.
