Barack Obama gets the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president of America
US President Barack Obama will be arriving at Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million, among other things, for an exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife and will be busy.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets five members of the committee who selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October for the first time.
The presidential couple then have a meeting scheduled with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
The afternoon after that, the visit will culminate in a ceremonial ceremony at which Obama will take over the prestigious award.
He'll get it as the fourth president of America, but only the third to win the prize right in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when he accepts the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
War effort increased a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which he will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
During the ceremony Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's going to give them to charity, but he hasn't decided on a particular charity yet.
The busy program will then lead the president and his wife to the banquet, where, apart from the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will also be.
From the beginning to the price, Obama stood rather reticently.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it was not just for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that he was called on to action.
Nature's protector accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police have accused the Chairman of the Civil Association of the Society of Conservation of Nature Litoměřice of extortion.
In several cases over the past year he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawing the appeal demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Litomerická police spokesperson Alena Roma.
Lubomír Studnička is chaired by the Litomerical Society of Conservationists.
Now he's in custody, and he's facing up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers of Brno don't smell very good
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their containers from drinks, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step of the way.
And in Brno?
There to reserve a few minutes until you find the right trash cans.
I do not want to say that the waste would not be sorted at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that the councillors are not interested in this problem because we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the forest league of waste sorting not only by the fact that as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but mainly by the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in a collection bin in the center?
It's a real skillet, it takes time and nerves.
The only place I've come across so far is in Moravské náměstí opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think it's a damn thing.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort trash like that.
From laziness.
It's a long way from the garbage cans.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored trash cans in sight on Kounicova Street.
Luckily, I ran into the right place on the way to the shalina.
But the garbage was overflowing.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps the city represents most, right?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don't interest the socialists in Brno.
The city would rather buy a hockey extraliga, which will disgrace us all over the country than buy extra containers and offer sorting of additional raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm my assumption after a while on the Internet with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has added, despite the government’s opinion to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or building savings.
But also interest on government debt or international litigation.
This will add problems to those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists promoted the increase to some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions, or sick government to borrow additionally. "It is only a postponement of problems to the future, putting mines," Janota says.
In fact, the money borrowed pays an increasing amount of interest, and it has to come back sometimes.
The state doesn't have much choice where to get it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all of whom the left has now added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
Pensions or sick leave, with 1.8 billion of their account missing, people don't have to worry, they get it.
But at the cost of becoming more indebted, next year, it will not be just 163 billion, but more, that will be missing in the cash register.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will grow faster and faster, along with interest costs.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternal VAT, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Five billion will also be missing next year for the construction of motorways and railways due to money transfers in favour of several groups of voters.
They are mostly already challenged and disaggregated sections, which can not be re-designed and possibly discounted.
Preservatives at best, which is also not free.
This means delay or stop of thirty large buildings, the use of European money is also at risk, and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka warns.
ČSSD suggested that the loss of money will be solved in shalamounsky – it will reach into ČEZ's dividends, which the state owns most of them, and from them the Transport Fund will supply.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is certainly not a bottomless resource.
Last year, 18 billion came from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends pay for the disposal of environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick under EU rules increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
But this does not end the carnival of relocations.
Almost three billion have been lost in the budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or to spending on litigation, even building savings.
If the state can do without this money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, worst case scenario, touch the government's budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing from the already launched two-billion-dollar State Treasury project, which is intended to enable online monitoring of what individual authorities are spending on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
Americans are counting on a mobile phone in the future, on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
Uncovered plans sound promising.
Just press one key and transfer from Windows Mobile to Android within seconds.
This is exactly what the American VMware company aims to do, focusing mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to maintain two user profiles at once on your mobile.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at one and the same time, suggested by Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran alongside each other.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware cooperates with European and American operators to test virtualization of smartphones and should reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains plagues hoteliers
The bare slopes do not concern only the Krkonose skiers.
The missing snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains you can still find free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Visiting our site we have a great deal.
People are going through offers, getting prices, but so far, they're afraid to make a binding order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask us if they will be on snow or mud this year," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Who wants a New Year's stay in Špindleruv Mlyn exactly according to his wishes, he should no longer hesitate to order.
Who prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is in his second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Špindlerova hoteliers offer mostly only a week's stay on New Year's Eve.
I think they're gonna try to turn them in for a while, but then they're gonna let go and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will be quickly reduced," Jandur estimated.
Free beds in all winter times are still offered by the Vrchlabe travel agency Ingtours.
Right now, we're most interested in Christmas week, which isn't sold out yet.
Even half of the seats in our offer remain open.
That is why we have prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabe Travel Agency, but there are fewer places available.
The first 14 days in February are also good for sales, while the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out too," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, the rooms of Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou are a little better than last year.
We're about five percent better off.
We have the last few seats on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest in Polish holidays in January and February is also well sold," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Prague.
The hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janské Lázně also has eighty percent of the New Year's Eve stays.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half the beds remain available in the newest Janskospa hotel.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, which is already occupied by about 60 percent at the moment.
A little weaker so far is February, but once snow attacks, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly rise, said the director of Hotel Omnia Erik Sporysch.
But for a larger piece of snow, the Krkonose hoteliers must let their appetite pass.
It's supposed to cool down on Thursday. If there's any rainfall, the mountains should be snowy.
But then the warming is to come again, Jiří Jakubský informed from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in Hradec Králové.
USA: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is comical, with what kind of schoolwork effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in Afghanistan, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it through a copycat from Bush’s Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to use the name Bush's statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward".
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by civil war as "unresponsible and in his consequences a catastrophic decision".
However, the following months have shown that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of field commanders was the only possible and very successful one so far that there is no talk of Iraq in news relations today.
It did not improve Bush’s reputation, but he objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
He was asked to increase his military contingent once again by field commanders, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordinating practices, harshly criticized hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't find anything better, so at least he cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to squeeze another 5,000 out of Europe, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic thing about Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process within three years.
Many doubt that a half-increase will yield the same fruit as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite sign - no one can be relied on and no agreements are observed.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces used to change masters every day are poorly prepared, depending on how convenient it is for them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain just a Potemkin village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely difficult given the ambiguity of the conditions that complicate even more Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Nor does the construction of an "actable state", which is the minimalistic objective of the entire operation, seem to be too real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to war for the purpose of "early return home" will produce a miracle here, only the soul can truly romantic, truly intact.
Politically speaking, determining the date of military withdrawal is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will see this as an indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is coming to a close.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how the safety of Germany or Italy relates to the war in the foothills of Hindukush.
The development of events around Iran is another factor able to intervene radically.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there will be a difficult question before the United States whether or not to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered at the time that Obama says America will move on to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also entail a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only Band-Aid for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore there is enough time left to come up with another strategy if this one turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash rewards
Goldman Sachs’ senior executives will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by a company that responds to a sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive shares instead of money that can be sold in at least five years.
In addition, stocks can be withdrawn from managers if they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is taking the lead in trying to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after putting nearly $17 billion (almost 300 billion) aside for rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total remuneration in this year’s enterprise is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of the announced measure today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political issue in many countries as the financial crisis comes.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to impose 50 percent of the tax on bankers more than £25,000 (about CZK 712.000).
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The record five women in Stockholm today took over this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature from King Carl XVI of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists among them was German writer Herta Müllerová of Romanian origin.
Two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for research on chromosomes.
The award for chemistry was given to Israeli Ada Jonathová, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last laureate was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for economic governance analysis.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
This award was earned today by scientists Charles Kao for research in fiber optics and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes, or astronomical telescopes.
Each award-winning has taken over a diploma, a Nobel Medal, and a certificate of financial rewards.
For each category, it reaches 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are more in each of them, they share the reward.
US President Barack Obama received the most traditionally anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversialness of his appreciation, for he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he is at the head of a country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defending his politics, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to fight for peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will adopt Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and possibly the Janot's staying in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to discuss his further stay in office on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus is now getting to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, however, the House agreed to the Left's proposals for money transfers and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticised the proposals of social democracy by secretly increasing the budget deficit.
There was a sharp intra-political dispute between the left on one side and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which started to raise a question mark over the further work of Fischer’s office cabinet, which was formed in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially destroying the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government pushed through in the autumn and which it believes is to stop State debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the State Budget Act, stated at today's debate breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had for some time neglected the 'serious problem', which is 'unsustainable deficit' of public finances.
He doesn't think he has a good solution today.
Only a strong government, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, is meant by the President, could bring about an improvement.
Chairman Mirek Topolánek of the ODS said that the budget is frightening and the government should consider continuing to exist.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the administrative cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Greens clearly no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer called similar words "strong statements" in response.
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topolánek government prepared for this year is frightening and will exceed CZK 200 billion.
Already on Wednesday, ČSSD marked the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
People were also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman played Mandela in the news of Clint Eastwood
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories, despite some criticisms, that American actors play the main roles.
The story tells of sports, racial conditions, and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is the Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 21-year-old Mandela asked him to do it in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another major role in it.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
Seventy-two-year-old actor who won an Eastwood boxing drama The Million Dollar Baby has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the slavery abolition movement, who eventually became a slave, a fictitious US president, and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many as Mandela.
He was a former South African statesman for 27 years in prison for his active work on leaving apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for undefeated and it is the name of the poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can bring his people together through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are global outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for years to get Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role so as to bring it as close to reality as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dine with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I squeezed your hand, I took your energy, it was transmitting, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, where white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, he opened it for me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in a movie.'
Despite the distinct differences in actors' characters compared to their real designs led by director Eastwood, Invictus received: Undefeated positive reviews, and there is also talk of Oscar ambitions.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the words: "He was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The Secret of the Shine Over Norway Declined: The Russians Tested the Rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the start was unsuccessful again, and the missile called the "Bulava", which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the proper effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava didn't usually fly or get damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already referred to as "a rocket that doesn't fly."
A Missile That Doesn't Fly But Shines
This in turn was already the 13th attempt carried out normally at first.
It was not until the end of the flight that technical damage occurred again.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which sailed below the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch of a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed broken "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians had no doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are fighting back this time, claiming that it is impossible to speak clearly of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident hit only the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Even though there was no test start without error, only six out of 13 of the Ministry of Defence considered unsuccessful.
Thus, almost 50% success fills the generals with optimism, and so they still claim that "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it can even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defenseman Vjačeslav Fetisov will be again presented in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former World Champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably start in the KHL match against St Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defenseman.
Fetisov trains regularly and agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formal arrangements, and the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club Sergei Nemčinov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only cover one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said Nemčinov.
Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey player, according to AP.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford’s legendary Gordie Howe and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the jersey of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold, seven world champions, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected achievements in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice over his head in a Detroit jersey.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has complied with the union, cancels all overtime.
The management of the Hyundai Nošovice car company agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the often ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
Spokeswoman of Hyundai Petr Vaněk confirmed it.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our production plan, which is crucial, which is why a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vanek said.
Server Sedička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday's shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
People will get that back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for the proposed overtime.
They can either cash an overtime bonus or they can take up a spare leave of December 28th, and thus extend their Christmas holidays by a day, said Vaněk.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive paid fares and lunch.
Since overtime was the most sensible and pressing point in terms of unionists’ comments and complaints, as well as protesters’ employees who stopped production last week, the management decided to cancel all overtime for December with immediate effect yesterday afternoon, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees of the car company were forced to work two hours extra hours practically every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike alert.
The next meeting between the management of the car company and the trade union is to take place on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, union leader Petr Kuchař said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation in the car company escalated last week on Wednesday, when roughly 400 employees were on a spontaneous strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management opposed the fact that overtime had to be made by employees to meet the requirements for the delivery of cars.
In their Monday announcement of strike alerts, the trade unions also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on workers who cut off production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions require the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of CZK 5000 for it this year.
Nošovice automaker Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The company started the serial production last November.
By this September, it has produced around 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'hardened' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity from drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on the common variant of the virus as some medicines already available.
AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
However, patients may be significantly extended by a mixture of medicines that prevent HIV from multiplying in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus reproduction results in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way for the resistance of the virus to be dealt with.
They have shown that a substance called metal carborans acts on the protein responsible for the proliferation of HIV.
Metal-carboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that is different from all medicines currently in use, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come up with new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metal carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV virus fission, mature infectious viral particles would not occur.
When we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is further systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease substances has been tested in the test tube as well as against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metalocarborans on the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as with clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modification, makes metacarborans interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
An argument over the budget. ODS went into Fischer, he resists
Head of ODS Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "terrifying" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister called ODS statements strong statements.
He says he's saving time for analysis.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the administrative cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he is going to lean on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit or to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to public deficits is diametrically different, warned Nečas.
On Wednesday, the House adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s criticism of the social democracy proposals was that they secretly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so that the government's wishes were met, that even the amended budget was a less bad option than the budget commission.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still evaluate the current situation.
Nečas believes that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment for the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering further remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
According to Nečas, if Fischer is to speak out for the next fight against the budget deficit, the ČSSD nominees who pushed forward the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if other laws are passed by the House to increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment to the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated for ODS did nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in a text message from the USA.
He recalled that there are some ministries in the deputy positions of the people applying to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decided to resign from the principle of combating the general government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
Then he said he couldn't count on the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to date, I'm going to do it, and Minister of Defense Martin Barták told the press in the House, who was nominated for the government by the citizens' Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council meeting this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS retreated
At the same time, Nečas stressed that ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the Chamber if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats had not explicitly asked to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS was burdened by the absence of party chair in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily the bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD order, fewer trains will go for almost the same fare
České dráhy will cancel or limit some less busy express trains and locals from 13 December, while other connections will strengthen.
The total range of traffic will be reduced by two per cent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the residents of Ostrava will get more connections to the capital, and the railways will add one set of pendolinos to this track.
Rychlovlak, on the other hand, stops going to Bratislava.
Less speed trains will also take off on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct connections Praha - Letohrad will be limited.
From the regions, the railways plan the biggest reduction of transport in the Hradec Králové Region, a total of eight percent, on the contrary, Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the line Praha - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to some days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice must transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Remote connections to the capital will end at the destination station Praha Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce multiple SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run in two-hour intervals.
From December 13th, passengers will no longer get a ride from Pendolino to Bratislava.
Regional rail bill this year: 200 million more
Fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, they will give four billion crowns to the railways next year, just like this year. Locals are ordering regions, they will pay eight billion crowns next year, while the state will contribute to less than three billion regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a new ten-year contract for locals and express trains, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, which is why they did not seem to increase the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Only one-day network tickets ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets will be changed.
For passengers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional towns and was 160 crowns.
Filipino gunmen are still holding over 50 people, children released
Today, in the south of the Philippines, gunmen kidnapped 75 people, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which originally reported only 65 of the kidnapped.
All 17 children in custody were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 armed men are reported to be using hostages as a living shield to escape the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed part of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police originally pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that required the handling of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was declared because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
There were 30 journalists among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the election to the governor's office.
The governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested on suspicion of attending the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood movie Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated) is coming into the American cinemas, which captures part of the life story of the former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman took the role of a world-renowned combatant against apartheid, whom he said he chose Mandela for his rendition years ago.
Matt Damon performed the male role of the legendary South African Rugby Champion Francois Pienaar.
With an image in the cinemas, they are raised by critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the South African Mjet.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he and de Klerk received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations, as they come to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are culminating, but at the same time, the media are shaking up disturbing reports of increasing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film in South Africa is positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main roles by the "flattered" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the new film in his words.
I've dreamed of this role for years, and I've been preparing for it well.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person many times in an interview after the opening night of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we can remember Mandela's personality and message with the film.
It's the story of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, added.
In the jersey of the national team rugby
A film based on a book by British writer John Carlin with a loosely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portraits the South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman thus tries during the film to unite two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of the population and, like in 1995, Nelson Mandela, he also enters an acting role in the South African national rugby jersey on the world cup course, which was won by JAR.
For entering the lawn in a jersey, which is almost understood as sacred in South Africa, Mandela harvested a large ovation of mostly white audience 14 years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve will yet to be revealed.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a recent interview with LN revealed a fan of rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
There is a transformer burning in Lounsk for tens of millions of crowns
The fire seized the transformer of Čeps in the substation near the village Vyškov na Lounsk in the morning.
In the fire, according to the spokesperson of the regional firemen Lukáš Marvan, six units intervene.
Originally firefighters wanted the transformer to burn out, but later they re-evaluated the opinion and the fire extinguishes a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing substances.
The cause was technical fault, internal short circuit transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mandátová's spokesman, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it can be precisely calculated after the fire.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one, according to Mandate.
In the ten years of operation of Čeps nothing similar happened, the defects of this type are unique, supplemented.
According to ČEZ's spokesperson for northern Bohemia, the supply of electricity was not interrupted by Soni Holinger Hendrychová, the operation of households, authorities and companies did not affect the fire transformer station.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and a line route of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file criminal charges for slander to three ČSSD governors
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura will file a criminal report today for slander on three socio-democratic governors.
Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura introduced it in 20 minutes of Radiožurnál.
The action relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional train transport in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with ČD.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, while we only brought an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true, because we know the ČD prices that were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation against Student Agency, said Radiožurnál Jančura.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of a criminal complaint to be a continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement by his company and his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend the good name of my own country and to challenge the other captains.
I suppose it will also prove clearly on this occasion that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public in the area of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, said Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will highlight the disadvantageous step of the regions.
He told Radio Journal that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year's.
He specified that the campaign would be waged against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway lines with České dráhy and to order around CZK 150 billion did not announce tenders.
According to Jančura, similar acts are against the law and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train transport in the regions Jančur already threatened the MP for the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, he told Radiožurnála Jančur today.
Vaccination against pneumococcals will be free and optional
Inoculations against pneumococcals will break down the practice since January.
It is to be the first to be free and optional for families.
However, voices are already ringing that mandatory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals are peaking.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices for vaccines paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are already clear on the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free Vaccines for August Children
Since January, children born last year on 2 August and later may be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they haven't received a single dose of vaccination.
Whoever started vaccination last year or before has to pay for the other boosters themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of age of the child.
Last year, she had her children vaccinated against pneumococcals by a quarter of the families.
The parents paid CZK 1600 for one dose and more.
Four doses are required for vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will issue CZK 300 to 450 000 per year for vaccination benefits.
But it saves on treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has paid roughly 500,000 per year for all child vaccinations.
The insured vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumocococcal causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain’s blan and blood poisoning.
In our country, up to 28 children under 10 years of age will die from pneumococcal infections per year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced flat vaccination of children against pneumococcals in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccination could be compulsory in the future.
As of January, it is to be covered by insurance undertakings and optional.
For example, Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association, indicated that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His pneumococcal vaccine association has been promoting them for a long time.
Experts at the international conference attended by our association were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that this has been achieved.
I think that's the path we need to take right now, said Kalovský.
But the Health Department doesn't want to change the course of vaccination against pneumococcals.
At this point, we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, claims doctors
The Chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Children's Doctors Hana Cabrnoch acknowledges that she has voluntary vaccination at her disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of booster vaccinations could be considered "When this vaccine costs so much, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," Cabrnoch says.
Experts expect to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcals from next year more than 80 percent of fresh parents.
Inoculation against pneumococcals is also a breakthrough in the fact that it is covered by health insurance as the first flat vaccination of children, not by the state.
Insurance companies should issue money for prevention, save money for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own fabrics
However, this is related to the concerns of practical pediatric practitioners who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intent, vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "carry out money from health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy and wait for insurance companies to pay for them.
According to estimates, individual practical child doctors will invest 40 grand a month in vaccines, a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'stealing in a museum'
The son of America’s renowned fantasist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to rob paintings worth $20 million ($12 million) from his father’s museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The appointed Mr. Frazetta and the second man used a digger to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, age 81, became famous for creating Barbara Conan and Tarzan's characters.
By the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as stated by the Associated Press Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer who stated that Mr Frazetta Jr. could be motivated by long-standing family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger affidavit, age 52, that he did so at the direction of his father, "to get to the museum in any way possible and to move the paintings to the malting areas", as the agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior denied any such permission, as the Agency said.
Labour is resisting the planned tax increase
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditure reported in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Tory have "missed" the opportunity to show that they mean seriously delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
Even the chancellor was under fire because of the disability of low and medium-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1 % adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Disability in respect of social insurance
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession that they had not caused and warned ahead of time of "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of approximately £3 trillion a year - which has outraged the community of entrepreneurs who have said that it is a tax on employment while focusing on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, limiting to this revenue of more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY PBR POINTS
Social insurance will increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers’ bonuses
Increase in 1% of the company’s depreciation tax for small companies
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase in pension assessment by 2,5 %
According to the state finance administration, some revenue of £30,000 will be reduced by £90 a year and some revenue of £40,000 will be reduced by £190, while some revenue of £10,000 will be increased by £110.
The ministers announced that their objective of reducing the deficit by half by 2013 meant 'complicated decision-making', but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of the highest-income people.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions were a "drain in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"They are big numbers, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said that he believes that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the amount of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, he stated that the decline in the economy was 4.75% this year - far worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - because the loans were £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A Wasted Opportunity'
Conservatives who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning against the Labour debt crisis, called the planned £789 trillion loan intolerable over the next six years.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan for how this could be paid, added, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that could be done," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals, and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and to a greater extent.
But the liberal democrats claim that the money raised by tax increases and reduced spending should be used to support spending next year rather than to reduce deficits, and argue that plans are 'built on sand'.
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson reported on the timing of the message - for example, the above-mentioned inflation will increase and the payment of benefits will be incompetence next April - that this could lead to the Chancellor’s accusation in the election campaign if money was difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although the ministers did not publish the details of expenditure after 2011, economists stated that it was clear that reducing public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognised Institute of Budget Studies said that the Chancellor's figures indicate substantial cuts in many areas, potentially involving transport, higher education and defence in the budocno.
"It is really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to revirro Deloitte's accounts.
"That was the report on the suspected preliminary budget.
The FBI is conducting investigations in 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation into a prison in Pakistan in five Americans, suspected of being involved with extremists.
The men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda in the province of East Punjab, as reported by the BBC US Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was an investigation into the same men who were reported missing in the last month at their residence in Virginia, U.S.A.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are reported to be from Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors, and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and under what circumstances they stayed there," said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the Agency had been informed of the arrest and had been in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature here and whether they are actually missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said that the men were arrested in a house that belonged to the uncle of one of them.
It said that the house was always the center of interest of the local police and that charges had not yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, said Reuters, but stated that the United States had to "cooperate more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Denial of amnesty for the Iranian abusers.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as the Amnesty International expedition report states.
The report describes in detail "the methods of torture" in the pre- and post-controversial presidential elections in June.
One man said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have called this criticism politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran, and dozens were killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street dismantlings since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Tens of them were arrested, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, now located in London, said that previously in protests, the Supreme Leader Ayjatolah Ali Khomeini declared the wrongfulness of certain tortures and banned their implementation at Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of legal power have been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
False Confession'
Amnesty International quoted a report from a 26-year-old computer science student, Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "work with Facebook" and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he said in his statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatening me with execution and humiliating me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, reported Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the protests and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants denied the charges of rape, but they admitted that torture was taking place.
Amnesty also reported the case of an ex-con who reported being held in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up committees to investigate post-election unrest and government responses, but stated that the mandate and authority of the institutions were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were made public.
The group stated that at least 90 people were detained in the last three weeks in order to avoid further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform Bristol’s memory into a race track.
The downhill track for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowbordists to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill track in the Brandon Hill park was a short ski jump bridge ahead of the 100 m long downhill track.
John Hickman, a fourth year medical student, said that it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill track, but that it was truly depressing.
It was a beautiful sight of the flashing lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowbordists from all over the country - some of them real talent," he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the downhill track.
After Thursday evening's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minarets and general news of the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they would integrate - into one of the most open secular societies of the continent.
Some readers after reading this book became admirers of the author's last work, "Why French don't like scarves on their heads" (2006), this elegant and debated study on issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the basics.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now take care of 5 6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproduces debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim enter a marriage in a mosque or in a town hall (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who's not a Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seem to be worldly issues that are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others well-known persons, including Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society at the same time.
They don't have arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen interviewed are inclined to believe that this is a counter-pole of Selafi—the supporters of the Purists Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia— this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so fiercely defends the lay public) are truly committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "tightening of values".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may tend to say, "Yes, but not now."
The World’s Unfortunate Prospects
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
The bordering ice melts at alarming speeds, which affects animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, describes the natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and procedures of whaling describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to capture a white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a courageous 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only with the musket is truly a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who swam behind the bodies of their just killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in one circus tent.
Even today, zoo corrals are typically a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. Climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians, and he often goes back to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is forbidden in Norway, America, and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are hunted on skis, and all are armed with powerful assault rifles to blast their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and eventually the ice will be the largest.
In his new book "On the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfying responsibility for science for the Arctic and an eye-catching glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not everything is answered by scientists.
Not even meteorologists and oceanographers have an adequate response to the speed of change.
That's for lack of testing.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s research routes first indicated how the moving ice took place.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting lines when they submerged.
Satellite exploration and extensive probe fields in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to the intrepid individuals camping in winter.
Mr Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the falling system "inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water, which is shrinking during freezing.
But from the seed of the bear to the microscopic miracles inside, all of this is doomed once the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that could be us'
6000 Marines put wreaths on their graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on a soldier's grave, never to be met.
For him and the other members of the Marine Corps who made their way from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington, to decorate the graves, that was the day in which they paid tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months' time, when we board, it could be us, Robinson told us about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I do.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths in the cemetery of veterans in several departments during a memorial act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during a memorial act in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this journey every year and stops in various cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America, which are also laid in other states.
In that year, volunteers placed more than 16000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, at the Pentagon, at the graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and at the landmark of flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has dedicated over $150,000 to purchasing and transporting wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, Westminster, said she made her way to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband isn't buried in Arlington, Mrs Hunt said it was her way of returning what the victim was doing.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Enveloped in the cloaks of warm cloth, volunteers passed through the cemetery on the surrounding grasses and hills.
Volunteers headed to the older graves of the First and Second World War and the war of Vietnam because they are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together while transporting the young pine tree to the grey tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red circle pčes the upper part.
Near department 60, where most veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there is indeed silence.
The associated service organisations donated 1000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars was filling this area.
Some sincerely wept, others prayed, and families and friends held on to each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stones, while others bowed down to see the small black and white nametags pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who would wipe tears from their eyes in front of their son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of the Navy Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're single, my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US government contractor trapped by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as officials of the State Department said on Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the US interest section in Havana, sought access to a detainee who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain accusations have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything called "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to take over the prices, but she has been denied the permit.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of growing tensions between the Communist Castro brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been observed as a "delaying tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report on the New York Times' incarceration on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Cell phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used to send text messages, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day’s salary.
The use of the Internet on the island is exceptionally limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must notify their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of a handful of U.S. citizens in a prison in Cuba are behind bars for criminal acts such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, press officer of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
The arrests and detentions were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free cell phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Society's program, who recently published an unfavorable report on the freedoms in Cuba, entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader and replacement for the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are heading for a larger dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are plotting to send men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops there, and stated that they hoped that this case might help to uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits who are online snooping for radicalized young men.
Investigators reported that they were searching for a gray rebel figure known as Saifulllah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovering them, when one of these men published a comment approving the terrorist attacks has an internet video site YouTube.
Saifillah took the lead on these men, as soon as they came to Pakistan, tried to help them get to the remote area of Pakistan in the band of indigenous tribes of Pakistan, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer reporting on the case said on Saturday that Saifulllah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaeda commanders and that men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate a terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sarghody, far from the horrifying mountains of the northwest, which became a refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
An official who spoke of maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case said why they were dropped off.
The official said that the men were not intimidated and were still trying to gain approval for access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested exercising Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has assigned top priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, disfellowshipping those who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. false recruits were subjected to a special examination in al-Qaeda, reported by analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential access to America's goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the US, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years in allowing Koh to approach them because American intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been so monitored? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action.
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday, demanding stronger action on climate from negotiators at the city congress centre of Bella.
The protestors reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police are resounding that the number was closer to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day a minor incident occurred in climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists were passing through the city carrying banners with English inscriptions "This is not Planet B" (i.e. second-rate) and one in Spanish that said "The Earth says 'enough'."
Several celebrities participated in the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who stated that she had traveled to her mother’s birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the dreary state of the country in which climate change is still taking effect.
That's part of the reason why we decided to join this great march -- walk the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided.
Police prevented the protesters from approaching the centre of Bello and said that she had detained 19 people, primarily because they either wore masks or had pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate horners, activists masked as athletes and in black suits have laid several charges near Copenhagen's main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, said, started with flares, but then followed by "a few major explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, the chief Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration still had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it really is something I do not realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the venue is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
The focus of the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change is seen, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's Federal Certificate of Knowledge in Mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the public education district of Columbia.
Although the district is far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth grade pupils over the past two years than in cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Testing Centre for the Advancement in Teaching are the remaining differences in the knowledge gained between African-Americans and white students, both local and national.
The average result of white pupils in the fourth class of Columbia district over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but their African-American peers have grown by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 points to 57 points.
Progress in eighth grade African-Americans remains essentially balanced, with a shift of statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not sufficiently large.
A six-year picture is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils in the fourth grade in 2003, when the first NEEP was performed in the district, was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from the oboi groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly close to 58.
In the last week, some district education advocates have said that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) have been greatly stimulated by white students where the results were already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, the non-profit group that advocates equality of education in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down for two or three points, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade primary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing the style of administration of Mrs Rhee, Mrs Brown said that the report on the test results means that secondary education in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what is horrifying is that we did not devote almost any time and energy to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said that the precinct's efforts are to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum reads, the Wilson system of reading, aimed at students of higher primary school classes and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their round careers and are significantly behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and curriculum of teaching mathematics to the sixth grade, highlighting the games and experiences of real life that came to the precinct behind the former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NEEP, which was reported last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and make the best possible interventions for those under-class students, said Mrs Rhee.
Others have stated that the NEEP results have clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's Mrs. Michell Rhee's specific dilemma, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional adjustment procedure is to focus the means and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political revelries that are directed against an important agenda.
But the blame belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the middle average between the whites and the blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must strengthen the relationship of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be confident that their children will receive excellent public instruction.
Mr. Janey, now head of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to ensure the validity of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers a "symptom" to look for a bigger increase next year.
Making Higher Education a Part of a Better Future
The roadside bus entered Gettysburg College with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got off and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green grasses.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the dorm.
Now she and other pupils of the eighth grade in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition was $38690 a year, their position was rather than intimidated visitors enthusiastic potential students.
Yes, that's it! Gracela exclaimed, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said with thought when they told them the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania College was one of the seven who visited on their three-day trip and were now completely intrigued by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the track.
The question is from where.
However, this is a serious problem with the high number of Spanish immigrants born in the US who are excluded from colleges or who become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who are going to receive college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one fifth of this "dwell generation" of Spanish college students - the remarkable results achieved indicate that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans and residents of Central America, made it to the United States without graduating from college.
Their success story is important, as researchers point out, because it underlines their point of travel for a generation that played a marginal role in the field of the country's labor force.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural inclination to school and an innate perseverance and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to attend college - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we take into account that children come from low income groups whose parents lack the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve this, says Patricia Gandhi, researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students in the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these kids with a preschool network in every way they can go through college.
The federal program that financed Graciela's trip to the dorms is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (advanced), it provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems to run college prep programs that start for students from low-income groups in secondary schools and continue until they graduate from college.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom entered colleges, according to US Education Ministry data.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to reconstruct their infirm infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements were concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian, and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in restoring the Iraqi oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies left with capital participation in just two out of 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction that started on Friday.
Only one made a lost offer.
Two American companies reached agreements on a field that was auctioned in June.
America’s crude oil giants in the open oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have here primarily on the road Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
That'll be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as US military withdrawals, are likely to discourage American companies from a much more intense business in Iraq, which is proven to have the third largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, US firms have been at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that made deals with the Ministry.
America’s leading companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, have kept close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and have offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
State National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic force, as well as a technological force, said the spokesman of the oil industry, Assam Jihad.
We believe that China's company will be comparable to its competitors and will live up to its obligations to Iraq.
Companies that have been provisionally selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry by the price of the barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current levels in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
On the impact of the U.S. missile on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, a top al-Qaeda operations planner was apparently killed, as announced on Friday by U.S. counterterrorism officials.
As confirmed, this could be a second fatal attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets landed in the quarter on their car near the town of Miran Śah in the province of Sevverní Vaziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have lamented that the missiles were launched from a unmanned aircraft operated by the CIA in a zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were put on a white car that was headed towards the Afghan border when it was hit, reported by an official along with the Pakistani Cicillian intelligence agency that telephoned from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local gunmen rushed to a point and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. officials of the anti-terrorist department quoted an unspecified witness who claimed that Somali was after death.
Somali was listed as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner, who led operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in enchanting around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be appointed, who introduced the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Qaeda's senior leadership, and based on them he planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said that Somali quickly advanced in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban who should have been killed since September when Najamdin Jalolov, a militant faction leader in the indigenous tribe band, and three other top populative leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of the attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has decreased since summer from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to Long War, a website managed by a non-profit group.
Reductions may have reason to improve the tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people suspected to be informants, listed the site.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
On Friday, the top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated that he would want to resign in March and end the turbulent term of office that was fraught with allegations of widespread corruption in the election of the President in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure is taking place because the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation said that it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US's timetable for reducing the state of affairs, starting in 18 months, should be a challenge for other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment taken must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said that he would not resign, but that he simply kept a promise to his family in March 2008, that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
Like I said, it's high time we looked for a follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials Ban has begun a search for compensation.
Officials have stated that it is a decision between Staffan di Mistura, who has Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, the French who had previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election of masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that the charges against Galgraith -- who was released -- "perhaps damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens to coordinate to ease efforts at the leadership of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also called on the UN leadership to allow its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so, as he says, he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at limiting his efforts in Afghanistan and stated that UN cumbersome hiring regulations undermine her ability to exploit her abilities.
The rules of the UN are that I had the opportunity to acquire only one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon impose "other significant sanctions" on Iran because of the lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a week’s journey around the areas where there is war in Afghanistan and Iraq, has belated the prospect of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
That's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about probable development. "
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is inseparable unpredictability in war.
The Obama administration has decided on a package of sanctions that could hit the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that 'a package of incentives and inhibitions' would require 'to make the Iranian government truly feel less secure with nuclear weapons', because 'its inhabitants will suffer extraordinarily' sanctions.
According to a Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the administration has put the European leader in the warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists on developing its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In his talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks about restricting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of his uranium enriched stock in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the interim agreements - partly because of this, says the expert, because the Irish leadership is divided into opinions about whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, with regard to Iran's stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a journey that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to search for other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'degraded sanctions'.
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the UN condemned on Thursday what it called "unwarranted and unfounded accusations" in front of some of the members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an adequate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he left for Kurdistan, oil-rich, to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There remains high tensions between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to prevent US plans from limiting the number of US troops from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates was also trying to dampen Kurdish concerns about persistent depression, and the US officials quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzaani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One more child means one extra grave".
Then they learned that when the official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We haven't saved anything for others, says Wang, 31 years old, a human resource manager with an eight-month-old son.
For more than 30 years, China's policy to have only one child was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously blubbered and spoiled children, dubbed "little emperors", threatening the country's population crisis.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 per pair compared to six before the policy came into force, according to UN data.
Population distribution, where the population aged 60 and above is predicted to rise turbulently from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, far above the total average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is the larger rich coastal cities with a population of higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 years of age and above accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportions of the ageing population and reduce the number of workers in the future".
He says it's about being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Gradual calming
As was inserted into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one child’s policy is probably still the most controversial mandate established under the Communist Party’s rule.
Couples who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in certain areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official posts promoted a policy that helped to prevent the country’s critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion in a second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexistly selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually more moderate in their opinion on the politics of one child.
As a rule, in 2004 they allowed the excerpts of exceptions - including urban residents, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were only children - and in 2007 they reduced the allocation of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the University of Beijing’s population research institute, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incite more births.
Almost overnight, posters, exhorting parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and insert leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who chose to have more than one child.
The response was cold, reported by family planning officials.
Grieving Response
Although officials in one rural city around Shanghai have noted an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign, most of the districts of Shanghai have not reported changes.
Huinan Municipal District with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases a month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Caola, Shanghai, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to give the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she'd like to have two children, and they were legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a dot-net, choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one child's politics as a questionable legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in her seventh month of pregnancy in a union with the first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the Human Resources Manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of attention of our families and we were all cared for.
We were not used to provide care, and we did not really want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who expressed his own translation company, expressed it much more openly.
For middle-class two-carriers who reduced birth rates, he said, to be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds, looking at their parents as fighting through the first days of a Chinese experiment with capitalistism, do not want this kind of livelihood for themselves, he says.
It's just one kid making enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the issues of the propstor -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You must have résumés ready at a time when a child is nine months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has outlined a plan for reducing emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching indiscreet attitudes and mutual appeals -- again on Friday, focused on releasing a document that proposes an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide a starting point for the final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, emphasises the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But important progress was seen in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text quietly states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of the rise in global temperature that political officials will still be able to tolerate.
That adds a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, head of the Sierra Washington Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed a six-page document, crisscrossed from 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what a top climate officer at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent in comparison to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has discussed urgently on Friday the promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from managing floods and drought to preventing deforestation.
On Friday, however, he introduced the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in the talks last week.
The US Special Envoy on Climate Affairs, Todd Stern, rejected the speech demanding binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared to volunteering for major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line against China by Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be examined by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after China's Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "salary sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" had led earlier this week to the announcement that the United States would not help financially China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the major world powers at stake, there has been a breakout both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States about fulfilling their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that the world’s two tens of the world’s most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative for carrying out stronger actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate in Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become far more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from being responsible in their actions.
It is clearly a game that the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional advisor in the field of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation of nature.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable influences of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members created a 24-page deal last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that the promotion of small island nations "has sparked political chatter for the entire political process" partly because they are now united and require action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations have given rise to a new urgency once the delegates have focused on the fact that they have to resolve most of the remaining issues before the Heads of Government are faced with an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Rameš and Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of the planes and ran the Bella Halls to close the doors of meetings and new conferences so that they could set out the demands to be assessed next week.
The vastness of the gathering - when 13000 people moved from and to the convention centre every day, to guitars played by activists staged at night an ironic spectacle of the countries they thought they had sent them and hand-to-hand proposals on paper rather than by electronic mail -- controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for Global Policy on International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming in.
The British first train at 140 miles per hour redefines this Monday's feelings
At 5:13 on Monday morning the whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train, which meant a revolution of traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles an hour and pass from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Pancras and exceed 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger set outside London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomerations of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Missed standing water should shorten traffic times in passenger transport and on business routes, and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
Theoretically, the three major political parties were allowed to gain for this vision.
But the tens of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now slowed down the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a viable study to the government, handed over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times said.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of another planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route of London’s connection with West Midland was designed within five metres in urban areas and districts, where the environment could be problematic.
In the open landscape was planned within 25 m of the final route.
HS2 also expects to identify three choices for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred choice is the configuration of the Y-shaped, when one high-speed line should lead to Western Midland.
The route should be shared near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most efficient choice has been made," said the railway expert.
As soon as this is done, the driving times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should allow trains to travel at 2250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to hijack trains of 400 m that would be able to carry 1100 persons.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing stations would be expanded to include a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but large-scale public consultation and planning procedures mean that what the final decision will not happen before the general elections.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing lines north of Birmingham and keep the journey times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of £75,000 on the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, holder of the front seat bench of the Tory in the Chamber of Deputies, was paid by taxpayers of thousands of pounds of costs last year for the orangery he built in his home in the constituency.
The spokesman for the party's prison that was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living on rations raised their mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-covered extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds a month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims on time, and so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who conducted the inspection of members of the expenditures. Last night, Mr Duncan made his demands "menoble to be cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the IRS has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is marked in the plans as "orangery".
Neighbors describe it as a "glass for entertainment and entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide some explanation for an increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the latest mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pubilary mortgage guarantee of £271406 from his London estate to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, one year before he became a member of the House of Deputies.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately £1400 a month in the interest of mortgages until March of last year.
In April, his claims rose to over £1,800 a month.
The interest of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage payments could not have changed at this time, which suggests that it was all intended to finance a loan of £75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payment fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, with which it remained.
The last document from the municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim £1250 per month this May.
Mr Duncan left his job as the shadow leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said that Members must survive on rations after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like [Bleep]."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and my claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MEP, a former oil dealer, was first asked to explain his issues in May, when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the approval of the tax office, that it "could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pit in the shape of a pound in Mr. Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 for three years.
When he was asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and then by Legg."
He added: "This is not a question of hiding and squirming or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's absolutely a straight line down, by the rules, justified, and that's it.
This would not be possible for many other ways to be cleaner or simpler".
Come and have a close look at the cabin on the Brighton coast with an Advent calendar.
Coast cottages in Brighton found a new purpose in winter as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the spiritual enjoyment of creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day of December, and to use Christmas wheels as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1st, when visitors were allowed to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop's bread and welded wine provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, assistant in television marketing from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"Idea of the Advent Calendar in cottages was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went out to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, have manifested themselves in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN Climate Conference, which aims to adopt an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, whose clear evidence is the current manifestation, would have contributed to the "political tax" of the eventual failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to the journalist AFP, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the procession began, when a group of about 300 protesters dressed in black began to break the windows with tiles and hammers.
The police immediately intervened forcefully.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultraradical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "indiscriminately" and stressed that about a hundred were in handcuffs and sitting "maintained in the streets on Saturday evening" despite extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly headed towards Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protestors stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was built for the speakers, before which a spiritual candlelight meeting took place with the participation of former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from large European cities, and besides Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning on the call of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of environmental debt in favour of the South, explained by Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from Jubilee South Coalition, Copenhagen.
We can no longer say, "It's time, the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo claimed."
In Africa, rivers and streams dry up, and today we can walk in them, and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the fight for another world has drawn closer to environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen to 'interconnect climate and social justice'. 'There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world'.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people went out into the streets.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and scarves of evocative importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protestors went out, demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east) participated in protests organized by the "350" movement.
There were dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected her president, Georgia condemns it as a "shut"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the other hand, claims this move to be a "shut".
Some 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgia War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The voting rooms closed at 17 hours GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazi Electoral Commission, attendance was 58% a few hours before the polls closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili " regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian rule," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants was recognised only by Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the separation from Georgia, after the conflict in 1992-1993, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the newspaper AFP Kvarner Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to vote in the voting room of the school in the capital city of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main issue of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea, which can be proud of the beautiful nature.
All over this small country, with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapš are deployed alongside Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful course of the elections received a warm welcome from the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We Abkhazia are grateful" he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, and toasted it with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized contracts concluded with Moscow last year, such as a contract that allows Russia to control Abkhazia's railway network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this outcome, the decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went out to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers showed up in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, acting on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly headed towards Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protestors stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was built for the speakers, before which a spiritual candlelight meeting took place with the participation of former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to journalist AFP, there were incidents shortly after the march, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed bricks and hammers, began to break windows.
The police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, while several manifestos were knocked to the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, ultraradical separate groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured with a paving block on his jaw and four cars were set on fire near a squat near incidents that resulted in about 20 arrests according to police sources.
We focus on extremist groups, warned police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while police helicopters flew again into the air.
Most protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, created in the morning in Copenhagen the first meeting on the call of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of environmental debt in favour of the South, explained by Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from Jubilee South Coalition, Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bová, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen to 'interconnect climate and social justice'. 'There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world'.
Oxfam has called on several famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen, or former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people went out into the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly red - dressed students, and scarves of evocative importance of solar energy, appeared outside the town hall of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a call for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east) participated in protests organized by the "350" movement.

Geography and history subjects will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, said Chatel.
Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that history and geography subjects will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of general grammar schools, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of grammar school with a focus on exact science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all there will be the same program from general culture, confirmed by Chatel.
According to the Minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy", because according to him the specialization S is no longer focused on exact science" but "actually, there are the best students in it".
The EC and L specializations cannot be for some kind of sub-specialization, it continues and stresses: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would complain that they do not learn geography and history in the last year of vocational grammar schools".
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by the daily Humanité, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government’s project to abolish compulsory history and geography teaching in the graduation year with specialization S, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticised this cancellation, both the left and some Members of the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not an option" to abolish philosophy in the specialization programme with the graduation year.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilisation against this project, which they believe will sacrifice the educational education of future professors of grammar schools.
As part of Master's degree 2 (M2) he will undergo an entrance examination focused on their field at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year another examination verifying their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will attend professional internships during the second year of Master's studies and will perform as a professor-intern before the first year.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose a 'personal right to education', which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite university of École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced in Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) at the initiative of Ecole Normale supérieure University on Ulm Street.
As one journalist informed AFP, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conference, a one-day seminar consisting of 15 minutes' contributions from experts who will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them more eager to learn more, explained on the occasion of the conference by 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after a fish from a local pond named by students.
About 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-arranged remarks, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, emphasizing the hope that listeners will know that the "Copenhagen Conference relies on a very seriously prepared scientific foundation".
Videos recorded at these lectures will be placed on the school's website from December 15th.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delay: angry prison guards, planned measures
On Friday, prison guards’ unions announced "general mobilisation", demanding that they be reimbursed for bonuses and overtime by Christmas holidays, whose payment was postponed until January for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2nd Peacekeepers’ Union) asked employees who would not be on duty to participate in a demonstration taking place on Tuesday morning outside prison facilities to "block them" and thus draw attention to "the theft of their wages".
CGT for prison overseers (3rd trade union of this sector) invited them to "call meetings in individual prisons and start a major mobilization" with the fact that it is "disgraceful and unacceptable" so that "overtimes and extra charges for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" worked in October are not paid in December.
The first union of overseers, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for overall mobilisation (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased a lot in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent a message to the prison overseers’ union to assure them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts the prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister in his communication.
I ordered the administrative directorate of the prisons to take immediate action so that the situation, which was caused by a poor evaluation of the number of overtimes, would never happen again in the future, was delivered by Minister Alliot-Mari.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous bonuses for performing their duties and achieving their goals, Ufap/Unsa states, and for those "there is always room in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional union of the FO in Marseille has become indignant and announced its decision to boycott 'all meetings and summonses' until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, unless they are reimbursed for these days of October in December, as well as for overtime, there is also a risk of FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when more and more work is being given to us and more work without further staff being provided, it is sad to allow the lowest employees to pay for it, reports CGT-prisoners in Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are few, stated Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forgott.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" at Christmas than the ones he gets.
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confided in Oprah Winfrey's "god" screen that as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I receive."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show that will be broadcast at ABC on Sunday night about how they are going to spend Christmas and end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a little four-legged family companion, gets his piece.
Jesus also likes Bo, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog also "of course" gets a gift, as follows from the passages from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts that she receives: "No, I certainly didn't, I gave you great gifts last year," she teased the president.
Well, of course that's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after that, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace, "Who gave you this?"
On this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous host who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obama couple also talked about their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with a ten-degree gearbox, but also a basketball given to him at Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely met.
I remember seeing my father come to see us for Christmas, and when he gave me that basketball, the president told me.
It was a long time after I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I evened out all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, remembering Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday's back in surgery, RTL says he's in artificial sleep.
Johnny Hallyday was operated again in Los Angeles because of the "injury" resulting from a larger operation he had suffered in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the station RTL stated that the singer is in an artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors stated the "injury resulting from the operation" of the cut-off disc that he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, his press department in Paris reported that these lesions required a "repair operation".
However, the press department of the singer tried to reassure the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical communication would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, who is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more sure, he adds RTL.
Press Department, upon request of AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no tube was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for an ejected disc.
The surgery, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a physician well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL information.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday because of an infection that occurred after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said on RTL radio Thursday that his friend was going through a "wrong time", but he added that he didn't worry about the rocker because he's a big fighter.
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing something stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like this was no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, said that Johnny Hallyday “responsives well to antibiotics” and that the infection was “stopped”.
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The health problems of the singer are only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But ever since then, each of his health problems has been very monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to dement a report on a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small swimming pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the World Cup in 2009 in a large swimming pool, won the title of the 2009 European Championship in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, which last allowed for jumpsuits, only three world records fell, although many more were expected.
One of them surpassed the Hungarian racewoman Evelyn Verrasztová for a 200 m position race and two remaining male relays of Russia for a 4x50 m position race.
A great sorrow for Bousquet, who sought the world record at 50 meters free in a way he already held in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m free way, the 28-year-old Frenchman with the final time won 20.53 seconds in the final round, at which ten swimmers instead of ordinary eight started first.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20,70) and Rus Sergey Fesikov (20,84) but failed to beat the world record (20,30) as expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record was in my range, I'd try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore overalls made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The combinations have helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 in the same competition.
This time, the use of the overalls did not help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in the big pool in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the record, which he kept at 400 meters free (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything into that race.
I knew I wouldn't beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent for the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.A.: a record of the Roman sarcophagus belonging to Zolo was auctioned for $1.5 million
The record of the Roman sarcophagus, which belonged to no one other than the French writer Emil Zolo, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than was estimated, said Sotheby ́s art dealer.
The price of this two-metre long and 63-cm high front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
Marble "representing four dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants is a rare work, similar pieces in the world are very few, perhaps four or five," said AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among 100 others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is an object that was probably the most awarded, told the AFP spokesperson Sotheby ́s, Dan Abernethy.
Emile Zola's purchase of this marble was found a few days ago.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borgia family collection, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bath in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, minister of the third republic in France and shortly before the Council President came to power of Marshal Petain.
It remained overshadowed for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered during the search of the museum database in the Louvre that this album was part of "the remains of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Interrupted attempt at President Zelaya's departure from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico concluded that the conditions for transporting the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, to whom the rebels refused to guarantee safe departure.
After the phone conversation that I had with President Zelaya last night, everything suggests for now that there is no way to make this transfer, the Mexican Secretary of State, Patricia Espinos, said.
The Mexican government aircraft, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya, flew back, reported the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Pučist government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demisi" and to apply for political asylum abroad, so that it would only give him the chance to leave safely.
But the overthrown president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exiled head of state.
The Pučist government "experienced another failure when it wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign", said Zelaya Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he often commented on the political crisis that has lasted in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, the overthrown president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
Mexico's Embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, because it does not contain a request for asylum, said the Minister of Interior of the Pučist Government on Wednesday, Oscar Raul Matute to Honduran Radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for Telesur Station, which has its seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as President of the Honduran people, he emphasized.
Rumours of Zelaya's departure mobilized in the midst of supporters of the overthrown president, who came to gather around the Embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the attitude of the Pučist government.
They thus show their marginal attitude towards international standards, added.
Zelaya, who approached socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on September 21st and found refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out of here, he'll be arrested, and he'll be responsible for the crime of treason, which he's accused of, claims the Pučist government.
On November 29, Pucist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise presidential elections to replace President Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo won the controversial elections recognised by the United States, but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended with an increase on Thursday, and the US trade balance results show an increase in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the closing deadline, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102,35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focusing on "half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
A major innovation is the growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of jobseekers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers has fallen "to the lowest of this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market has also fallen.
The proceeds of the Treasury with a view to 10 years increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the yield to 30 years increased to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime booed "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundred Cuban regime supporters booed the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented further manifestations for which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in White", wives or close political prisoners were booed directly on the street by the supporters of the regime of Raul Castro during their march towards the capital center, with a request for the release of political prisoners, informed the journalist.
Down with the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted with the fists raised by the regime's dissidents.
Dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to "ensure security".
The day before, there was a similar manifestation in Havana against "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about ten dissidents were arrested, who were also about to appear on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, reported the journalist AFP.
According to this journalist, police have loaded dissidents who have been booed by supporters of the regime into civilian vehicles using force.
Arresting dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The winners of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for 2005, "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for "exempting all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their archenemy, the United States.
It's a miracle, Cuban television has brought news of Thursday's demonstration of supporters of the government regime against the "responsors of the revolution".
Cuba, with the Communist Party at the forefront and one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak time on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary findings of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in or before the pharmacy, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, this is the version of police and witnesses.
Severely injured old man, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance Police Syndicate in the hospital as a result of injuries.
In this pharmacy or before it, the attacker assaulted a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband in his 30 ’ s began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80 - year - old man died.
The life of the other injured person is in danger, according to police sources apparently the vital organs have been affected.
A pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as reported by a police source, then fled into the street, still on boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He hurt two more people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, because everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried behind his back, said at the location of the Head of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
According to AFP’s testimony, several passersby, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the lunatics.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, he commented on the situation of Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
The crowd threw him, including a city police officer who broke his wrist, added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to apprehend an armed man and were injured by fists, reported a police source.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The passers-by came to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70 - year - old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a large blow to the abdomen, told AFP Frederic Allione, a 35 - year - old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second, about 30 - year - old person, who also had stab wounds with a knife, came in.
A man who had no ID on him was then arrested by the state police.
Prosecutor at Nanterre handed the case over to the District Police Investigation Department at Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspected assailant was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, awaiting questioning.
A police source didn't rule out his whereabouts in a mental hospital.
Another police source said it took six police officers to take him to Clichy Police Station, where he was taken.
He was "out of his mind" as "all the lunatics of this type, whose power increases in action tenfold."
U.S.A.: Polanski's lawyer again requests that the prosecution be terminated
Roman Polanski, a Polish-French director, applied again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that took place 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the attorney-in-law of the director of the film "Pianist", criticized serious mistrials at the time of the 1977 trial in the second district in California before three judges of the appeal court.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now, and immediately, the lawyer Hummel said, and he added that Laurence Rittenband's behavior was "freezing in the back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) had to deal with the prosecutor before the verdict was pronounced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But at the end of September, Mr. Wells finally declared that he "lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will demand a trial in which he can present evidence of his claim.
The prosecutor repeated what had already been said at the first state, that there would be no serious study of the request to stop prosecution until Roman Polanski came to court.
A 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court handed down a verdict on "illegal sexual intercourse" with a teenage girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never again entered the territory of the United States.
Deputy Prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to take part in the trial."
In this case we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayam.
He believes that the director "requests the court for kindness and also despises its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to take a decision, also stressed that 'there are other alternatives to escape'.
Hummel's lawyer wasn't the only one asking to stop Roman Polanski's prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also again requested that the prosecution be terminated.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the constant harassment every time the Polanski case emerged and said, "No one in this room can say that the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26th in Switzerland by U.S. order
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a possible expulsion.
Wall Street ends with no direction, it's being held back by a rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market is tossing among indicators that are better than expected in the US and rising dollar price: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the closing deadline, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance he left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly, and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of economic indicators which are better than expected, and which have "helped to improve the mood of the market in terms of stability of economic recovery," summarized the analysis by Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November, and that was the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the confidence of American consumers has also returned and increased strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices have been held back by a new increase in the dollar price against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are losing ground.
The stock market's down.
The yield of state treasures over 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with 30 years increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% a day earlier.
Miss World's choice again in South Africa.
After a month of traveling across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream: be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration has been held for the second year around Johannesburg and so far five candidates have gained progress in the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real vortex of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!, she confided in Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa after nine o'clock, will be broadcast live from Midrand, North Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. (15 p.m. of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country to wear a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy to have been able to experience it twice. She confided in Miss Xenia Sukhin, in the hot summer of the south.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "land that takes breath away".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participated in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner, who both became the stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We are envoys of our countries, and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to organizers, the 59th year will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in bathing suits.
The performance will be presented by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean and Chairman of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome a warm world that is hard to deal with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
The candidates participated in safari last year, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bike, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual to the president, she remarked Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I'm definitely going back to the 2010 World Cup, says Alice Tatacchi with enthusiasm.
According to David's son, Hallyday's status reports are "very positive."
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday during the performance of the plane, which flew from Paris just after 13th hour of local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer’s son, who worked calmly, said that he would arrive at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles as quickly as possible, to which Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to post-operative infection resulting from the surgery of the eviscerated intervertebral discs he had undergone on November 26 in Paris.
According to the press release, the singer was in Los Angeles this night for the convenience of "put into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was the doctors of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles already put into an artificial sleep. The hospital was hospitalized due to an infection after surgery of the eviscerated intervertebral discs made on November 26 in Paris.
Due to serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer's information, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of the French Lyceus in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The priority of the department of orthopedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he was leaving for the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November at Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday has gone too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon.
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already suffered twice from intervertebral disc prolapse, he added.
Shortly before the radio station RTL said that the singer apparently flew away after the Paris operation without a drone, without anything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in removing the hematoma resulting from a brain bleed.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, sentenced several times in cases of malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
The attorney of the medical chamber Olivier Metzner called him "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" summoned before the medical chamber, and who can't even be "not recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He reported that the procedure had "absolutely good progress" and the postoperative examination was "normal".
The operation was not haemorrhagic in nature, therefore the introduction of the drain was not necessary", he added.
The health problems of the singer have grown since this summer, and in any case his tour seems to remain with the question mark.
It is clear that the date of the reopening of the scheduled tour on January 8 (Amiens, note red.) appears to be too close, said Camus.
The UDF Group raises its tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre not to continue to use their acronyms.
On Friday, the UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayrou, responded to the attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to take possession of the abbreviations of the former Giscard party, with the fact that he must not use the abbreviation in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the acronym UDF with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear her inheritance after he shook his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mr Hervé de Charetto (formerly the NC-UMP) who credited the UDF brand ownership because he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004 (l'Institut national de la proprietary industriale).
But on Friday evening, the Committee of the UDF Association, managed by François Bayrou's friends, who do not intend to be expropriated, stepped out of his silence and made a formal request to both the minister and the MPs to stop using the abbreviation and hand back the trademark's ownership, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased your disturbing statements that you will propose to your political movement + re-take a shortcut to UDF, writes the Association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of Alliance Centre.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your promotional material and on the welcome website of your movement, with the slogan +UDF today+, also the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC's immediately to remove all mentions of the name UDF from all promotional materials including (its) websites".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette to "give ownership of the trade mark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will appeal to the courts in order to respect the law and legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they say that UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends "chosen to "leave in 2007" to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002 to establish an UMP.
The movement Nouveau centre therefore, according to them, has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoD for three years and to create a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscarde d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues "when he registered the trade mark", was no longer "a member of UDF" for three years, but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used non-existent acronym registrations to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion begins to turn into a crime, declares it, and then, ironically, they comment on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in both politics and everyday life, it is more valuable to create a name for itself than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name to which we have no right".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to give a verdict as to whether he had used the condition of weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which was blamed by her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his famous photographs, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, a criminal offence for which a maximum of 3 years is imposed and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter attack each other and fights for the management of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by a college of three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Attorney General in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 at the same time as expressing whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and in what period.
I think he's going to do it.
I'll talk to her about the matter. After the hearing, Ms. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman, said.
As for François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It is excellent news(...). Expertise shows that he has verified with this old lady who needs protection (M. Banier).
It's been two years since the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-artist who has been blaming him for taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years in order to obtain a donation of a billion euros in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, on Friday the court's case of attorneys changed to the family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt’s lawyer submitted three letters sent by her client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary expressing her mistrust of Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
I have never been able to talk to Françoise since she got married."
The prosecutor’s office at Nanterre again found that the complainant’s conduct was not justified, even more so, that the guardian’s judge rejected her application to initiate legal proceedings for her mother in those days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is perfectly capable of taking part in the trial, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court of First Instance held that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to comment on the merits at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was pointless...
For more than a decade, the behaviour of management of large companies towards employees reminds us of the approach of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about co-workers identifying themselves with the "values" determined from the mountain, as was the case before, when the consumer had to be forced into products that came from the ideas of factory technicians.
By becoming the centre of business companies, the customer compared the marketing revolution with the market-conquering strategy in the right direction...although authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, return regularly!
A passive approach of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA, or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mainly managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to predict" and requires from employees commitments that are completely contrary to the revenue of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a management revolution, which aims to put workers at the centre of business interest as well as a client.
Relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will they contribute to a revolution in management procedures?
I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that, in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it has always done after a different turn-off!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of mental convenience, they adopt an old behavioral theory, now revived by the "neurosciences" of the US and widely distributed without much knowledge by the scientific constitution and the media.
With the possibility of moving the levers (sic) involving managers, Ipsos' recent survey has shown on Figaro.fr, which only confirms the management staff in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists of incorporating a basic observation into all the intentions and practices of management: for employees, commitments towards the enterprise will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies Motivating functional analysis are concerned with this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their businesses on the basis of a pre-defined dox that allows them to evaluate what they are offering to achieve their goals by means of an image that tells them about the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate on their "social achievements" and put their human resource management "on the right track".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of sound and effective economic intelligence.
By speech from Oslo, "fair war", Obama earned praise from the right.
The American right welcomed the speech that Barack Obama gave the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who at first mocked the Obama award on October 9, applauded this time the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former Vice President's candidate for the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a muse of the right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. Today, and added that she herself expressed herself on this topic of "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs that are currently coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces on Thursday in Oslo and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former president of the House of Representatives, who appreciated the President's mention of the "existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I thought this speech was quite historic, Gingrich said during an interview on "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the 'left-wing president' remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee, that they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the prize for peace if the use of force did not exist'.
According to Michael Gerson, former speech writer George W. Bush, editor of the Washington Post, Obama now gave a "very American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "citizen of the world" as always, but he "speaked like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they themselves did not create, and that they do not do too much to preserve it", Gerson considered.
Among the few dissatisfactions of the right are the Bush era hawk, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "unique, pompous and uninspiring", as he stated on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, for example, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at looking at Barack Obama as he justifies the use of force.
"When we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-left press takes a commendation on the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to regard Obama as premature in awarding the Peace Prize, it considered his performance as an "overperformance" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, combating poverty and oppression", says the California daily.
Obama "pronounced as necessary", evaluated the New York Times, and called the speech "simple and instructive".
Road hauliers: three marathons to a deal that saves the delivery of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, the road hauliers’ union and TLF, the only employer’s organisation that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the call for strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, during Friday's signing of the agreement, expressed "joy" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning, hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the meeting.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting that started at 11 o'clock to get everyone to agree and sign the deal at 18 o'clock.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "there would be a risk of disrupting the holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The text contains an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we will order our members to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may still be a few opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was hard to admit an increase in high salaries due to the international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an 'acceptable compromise'.
The agreement also foresees a revalorisation of travel expenditure of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "EUR 100 million reduction in corporate payroll tax" which was the subject of the Government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on on Thursday night on Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a 'congruent' vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organisation, later to the whole industry, in case of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time", assured Bussereau.
The whole process can only slow down the disapproval of employers' organisations.
The FNTR talks about 'bad business' because EUR 100 million 'has already been offered to compensate the sector for part of the carbon tax'.
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not because of mutual analysis, but because of unkindness of turkey eaters during the coming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, there is a risk that the agreement will "buy a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field" over the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: traffic interruptions on weekends, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP transport company.
The interruption of traffic on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because Friday's negotiations between the trade unions and the management of RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of the premium application.
On Saturday and Sunday, i.e. the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only run between 10 and 20 o'clock, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every other train, outside of this section only one train of four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Galeries Lafayette stores, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that " RATP was trying to secure connections with large department stores".
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in operation and practically no train was running at the time off the top, as planned.
As on Thursday, the people of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were a lot fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, including because there were no pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time.
Saint-Lazare Railway Station was not crowded, it announced the state railway SNCF, because a greater number of orderlys and guardians of order were predicted.
The suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
The next general meeting of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will evaluate the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership, which the unions have rated "weak".
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban trains RER A in all aspects, working time adjustments, careers, etc.
However, this is not the case with drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (South Departments).
RATP has even postponed the proposals on the bonus so far, which has made the CGT aggravating that the management "was unable to solve the problem while the travel carriers and SNCF were able to do so".
At the new meeting scheduled for Monday, "the conditions of employment will be examined more closely", RATP specified.
Which is why the union thinks the business is making fun of weekend travelers.
In the morning, about 150 drivers were occupied by the Corporate Committee at its Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "relief".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independent have announced a strike alert.
The unions are asking for a premium of between EUR 120 (Unsa) and EUR 150, of which EUR 30 of the variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and are making it difficult for the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which transports millions of passengers daily.
RER suburban train drivers earn between €2200 and €2700 gross wages in the advanced period of their careers and €600 to €650 bonuses for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey’s justice disbanded for the Kurdish party, and this decision has severe consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Kurd party in the country. This decision immediately sparked protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it became "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said Hasim Kilic, President of the Supreme Court, after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 Judges, when it was necessary to dissolve the party with a majority of seven votes, Kiliç stated and added that 37 party cadres, including its President Ahmet Türk, and Aysel Tugluk, were banned from participating in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tuglik and the confiscation of the assets of the Party by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (of 500).
The Party's leadership has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes when the government is giving the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offering a number of measures to strengthen their rights and trying to limit Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP management has confirmed that dissolving the party could lead to the resumption of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have turned against the conditions under which the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being held into clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, mainly inhabited by the Kurds.
The police used tear grenades and water cannons, protestors threw Molotov cocktails again, or they shot rocks out of slingshots.
Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people demonstrated.
After the verdict was delivered, Mr Türk said that justice's decision would only "intensify despair".
Turkey cannot solve this question by banning the party, stated in the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We're on the anti-traffic principle.
It doesn't solve anything, Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete blast of the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course we can look forward to the reaction from PKK, added.
On Thursday, PKK joined one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
Pretty crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter department of technical services FES.
But so that his employees can test and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This weekend could happen for the first time, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they go up to 20 so-called sections of A Large Sprinkler, explains Brauburger.
These sections include major and transit movements such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and descent sections like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle moist salt, which is better held, within a maximum of three hours, some 1040 kilometres.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "to keep the roads open when the traffic starts to work."
It's hard when it doesn't start snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers."
Only when it doesn't snow that much are there access and interconnection roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side roads and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES pawns set off on the road, priority being to clean up dangerous places and crossings.
The FES can't usually take care of all the bike paths.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that monitors mainly bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As the iceberg is quickly formed on them, the sprinklers go out as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: Animal two metres long and 1.50 meters high ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sickle claws and long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas, Austin, and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body traits.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window for the previous evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about kinship, expansion, and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating in Ghost Ranch, north of New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The photos of the dinosaurs from the Triassic are very rare, mostly they only find individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
A particularly sensational finding is not, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
In the current scientific view, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of Pradinosaurs is usually questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards were divided into three of the most important development lines: carnivorous terrapods, which later included Tyranosaur Rex, Velociraptor, as well as birds, "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (birds), such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues the original terapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
Researchers, for example, found evidence of air sacs on the skull of Tawa hallae, which even the offspring of the terrapods have birds.
Thanks to air bags, bird breathing is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already created by the common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Since so far the most notorious dinosaurs have lived in South America, scientists have deduced that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines were split soon and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time as the Pangea supercontinent formed a uniform earth mass.
The fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related terrapods, would also speak.
Those three can't come from one common, migrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One of the older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to the group of the toughest dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His supposition could put together a distorted picture, because very many primitive dinosaur fossils have remained preserved in South America, and they are rarely found on other continents.
As dinosaurs have proved, from the relatively rare sideline of the reptile family to the ruling vertebrates on earth in the Middle Ages, it remains a riddle.
During the trial, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the trial, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while relatives died out and the interface of the trial and the jury.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses as to how to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been mass extinctions that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs adjusted better so they could push out the competition.
In any case, the history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, meteor impact helped another group of animals, who also evolved into a triassic and lived in the shade of mammals since then.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
On the list are professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paula, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clean-up of the occupied casino at Frankfurt Goethe University has provided a worldwide commotion.
278 professors and teachers at Goeth University, but also universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidaritying with protesting students at Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they do not "appreciate" the presidium-incited police intervention.
As the walls and works of art were scribbled, university president Werner Müller-Estler cleared out the building occupied last week by students on strike and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
Damage to the cause, judged by the signatories, does not justify "violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teaching by police commando".
Eviction is an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is used to "illegality and criminalization of protest" and distracts attention from content.
The presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers are calling for a halt to criminal prosecution.
It is said that most strikers did not support material damage.
Proposed protest
The youth of the trade union Verdi and the German trade union also solidarity with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for your own future, says the mystery of the Earth youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessen Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is defending the procedure of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
The destruction and cast are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday at the Aktuellen Stunde (current hour) in the Wiesbaden Land Assembly.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said the MP of the Earth's Assembly for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens, and Link saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls for an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, there has been a cleanup.
Linke has made a proposal calling on the Home Secretary to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For years it has been paying for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered the Russian Silicon Valley.
There are important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, Greengrad representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt Research Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits, and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by the Moscow multi-mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect from Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, and under Frankfurt was signed by Edwin Schwarz, head of planning.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to the seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ companies will be able to seize on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name according to the wooded hilly landscape, which is planted with research facilities.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared.
For the fans of the project, it is quite simply the "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than starting a train station, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade into desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the '80s.
The head stations with tracks that ended in the city centre were then considered transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, because it took enormously much time to switch locomotives from the back to the front.
Pull over, pull over, keep going - that's how it's supposed to work.
And that's why the head stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly halfway through the trans-European railway highways between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about the 'heart of Europe'.
It really begins with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Very ambitious designers themselves have learned that in Hessen and Bavaria's big cities, the start of construction is almost unfunded.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, head stations have no more problems with driving and driving.
Yet: Starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
Earth and local politicians pushed it through.
The railways cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistly, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The railway station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which was typically attributed to a huge increase in the 1980s.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
But modern transport policy must primarily be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
More importantly, S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euro was to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, funding will be missing at other nodal points and narrow sites in the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, he has been on this route at a slow pace.
It would take a lot of pressure here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine Valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport
The Earth government has left the Wiesbaden Assembly open if it goes against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and has it revised.
The CDU/FTP coalition commissioned experts to legally assess more than a 400-page VGH judgment, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
Today, VGH in Kassel has written that the State would have to redefine the night ban on flights in case of construction of the planned northwestern runway of Frankfurt airport.
Permit 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as envisaged by the Earth's government, does not correspond to the legal order to protect the population from night air noise.
The Coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will require a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this delay and pressed for representatives of the government to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises regarding the ban on night flights that she made before she was elected. Otherwise, it can be classified as "a violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green Tarek Al-Wazir's boss in reference to the FDP 'We keep our word' slogan.
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's complaint, the Earth government is trying to get to its night flights through "ruining the law and tricks".
Accurate legal control needs its time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of the "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The claims of his faction to ban night flights were never the same as that of the opposition.
America’s Banks Pay for Help
American, crisis-shattered big banks get rid of state bonds.
At the same time, the Bank of America paid off assistance from the Tarp Bank’s bailout fund of $45 billion (about €30 billion) on Wednesday.
According to a report from the US CNBC station, Citigroup is also planning to pay off state aid.
The constitutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions that have been made by accepting money - reducing the payout of bonuses to managers and paying high fees.
With exchangeable bonds, the Bank of America has obtained well $19 billion of net money from investors.
She took the rest of the money out of her cash register, which was filled, among other things, by trade unions.
On Wednesday evening, bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer: The money injection helped us to overcome the difficult times.
At the top of the financial crisis, the Institute of Money harmed itself by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup also wants to break free from its commitments to the state by raising money on the capital market.
With reference to resources, CNBC informed that this US bank could already announce a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
Citigroup's spokesman didn't want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley paid off the aid.
Quick Option
After all, it went faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the grémium wanted to make a deal with the person.
Peter Frey, head of ZDF studio in Berlin, was the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially, so it wouldn't get ahead of the process.
However, the role could also play that they did not want to harm the ZDF's ZDF intendant, Markus Schächter, if this proposal did not go through with the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine out of 14 members of the Gremium.
The result of the vote was not known before the closing date of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender’s loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though one could expect.
The U.S. majority on the board of directors signaled several weeks before the elections that they did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused further to remain in the office of a highly respected editor by arguing that, under Brender, the ZDF's reporting rates had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
For the last time, even 35 state-law lawyers, who consider Koch's approach unconstitutional, have been mixed into the debate.
It didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 went to Frey in ZDF, first to heute-journal.
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of ZDF’s main studio.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the media magazine journalist of the year, was deposed, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional suit.
Koch’s counterpart on the board of directors, Prime Minister Kurt Beck of Rhineland-false, explained last week that the Länder should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the Intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF supervisory board.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board with a clever chess move - immediately after Brender was deposed, he strongly criticized the grémium for it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing face, so he could have been elected by the board of directors without being suspected that the party would have been pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is still ranked left-wing liberals.
Studying Gets Rid of Harm
Partial success for students: After a year of strike, the Culture Ministers finally went to the Länder on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, both parties agreed that it was the will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the load by testing: In principle, each study module should be completed with one single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be re-checked and the "real and defendable rate" guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Lands undertake to create a more flexible joint structure assignment for bachelor and master's degree fields.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the start of student protests in the worm, the ministers of culture and university speakers have had winged words in their mouth about a better study.
Now, for the first time, they're filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided that the number of tests will be reduced in part drastically: "Every module will usually be completed by one test", says the 30-page report, which is intended to partially regulate the approval of study fields.
"A significantly lower test burden," said the Chairman of the Accreditation Board Reinhold Grimm, "a false development that significantly reduced the demands of the study is to be halted."
To this end, the "satisfaction of study" should be a "decisive criterion" in implementation in the future.
Modules and contents "must be checked hard" so that "do not limit students when choosing
seminars".
Students should "claim for space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, after examination but also for existing fields of study.
These need to be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 to re-check all study fields.
All over Germany, ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this, subject to the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Culture Ministers called on the "emphasis" of the Länder to operate on agencies so that the content of the classroom was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the Ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far has promised the Rhineland-Palatinate additional resources for further development of the Bologna Process.
In particular, universities should cover consultation programmes and study advice on money, and strengthen trial and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to her, only one single test should be needed to complete the study module.
Formation of the study should be even more flexible, so as to guarantee recognition of examinations from other universities and to make it easier to make the master available.
By the end of next year, the demands of all study fields in the country should be rechecked.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition argued again about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution was also given.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called on the development of education policy not to take place in the future "with closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word to it" should also be said by students as the persons concerned.
The future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need students' experience", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Culture Ministers with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: they require a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree to access the superstructure master's degree.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that, for today's generation of bachelors students, there are enough seats available tomorrow in master's studies with the best possible study conditions, said the member of the Board of Directors of GEW Andreas Keller.
The federal countries must employ far more speakers.
But the Ministers of Culture did not comment on the free access to the master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
To get to Germany and get out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn-out language piece is thematic of the experience of travelling one dissident who gained freedom, but also lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessen Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
A major extra-literary commotion took place last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security act".
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to his fellow writers the Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, to cooperate as a secret informant for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German language prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts were said to have started inconspicuously, at first in 1971.
I am, continued by Söllner, "that is, someone who has not resisted enough attempts at intimidation by Securitat."
Poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as awarding the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and infamy of the political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but is also the victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a part in the Securitate acts, told Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to a positive influence on himself as Secret Agent Walter.
"Chopping" me at all points at the time, Markel says.
He has a moral obligation to make that remark.
Söllner's statement was, in this form and in front of this audience, not unexpected, but a completely surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote already in July, when she read her own act, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate spies.
The concerned, one can assume, will speculate and in some cases also probably know which name is hidden behind the alias Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Other than in domestic, in the meantime a very certain inspection of the Stazi components, manipulation of the estate of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been undermined and restricted.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securities (CNSAS), was only established in 1999, and the issue of the Act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
After publishing the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, former members of the Securitat still have a great influence in Romania, he demonstrated one interview in which one of the former leaders of the Securitat from Timisoara expressed his rejection of the award winner.
She's got psychosis, after all, she's only been questioned once.
The humiliation of power has been expressed completely in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, there are inevitable questions about the case of Söllner, as well as in connection with the covert wrongdoing.
Why now? Who was harmed? A strange reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession is expected that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the acknowledgment of guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
The Champions League's Saturated Deposit
It looked like a clean-dressed sales rep came in from a cute Christmas party where he was handing out sports goods candy when he got into the C-class Mercedes after midnight, the new coach VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by an orange coloured bag of sponsors."
A man with marked baldness was driven around a strange city for him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk luck was a 55-year-old man too little.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we'll continue our work.
Or it's just getting started.
In the words of only three days engaged Swiss: "We have achieved the eight-finals", that is, in Champions League thanks to the win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against descent."
"More important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mainz even on a regular league day.
And avoid obvious weaknesses after three quick goals by Maricy (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Lottery
The Champions League eight-finals will be drawn in Nyon on December 18th.
So the joy of Babbel’s Starburst Succession will be preserved.
Not only the alleged healer, who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence in a short period of time, willingness to engage and enjoy the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be bolder, explained the Gross soul healer so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, did not prove any effectiveness during the work of Babbel's therapist.
He stirred up some magic, admitted Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after many weeks of break caused by the injury, became the best player on the field thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomena" identified by the proverbial "fresh wind" and working procedures of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demanding discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Apparently, it was missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns sports president Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened spare and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after defeat 0:4 in Leverkusen, thinking Khedira.
And sports president Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not done yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate on his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months, was caused by weekend events that recently came alive in the form of a television interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann just before the game began.
There are decisions that others and not Jens are active, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He was pitching the board of weak leadership and decided to change coach after the pressure of teenage fans.
Lehmann called his day off after the games a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's words "pronounce pure egoism", replied Heldt and announced a consensus for goalkeepers.
I don't think both 40-year-olds will have any more joy in life.
In any case, they agree with others that without the work of a deposed coaching team it would not be possible to play such a strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
The heavyweight World Cup fight
Passionate duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in heavy weight of the WBC boxing organization.
The judge's statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night at Bern with one voice on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukrainian was twice the World Champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the one everyone was expecting.
Klitschko improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice defeated because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena drove 2.02 meters high Klitschko fight mainly with his left.
But one inch smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Klička's era before the duel, withdrew before the world's champion was struck, so Kličko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In total, passive Johnson did little to challenge the challenger, and he was just trying to get into the next round.
Klitschka provoked with words and gestures, but his strokes rarely hit the world champion.
But still, he's only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko for twelve full rounds.
The challenger took care of the commotion in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as "a disgusting zombie" who "can't do anything right".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled his sunglasses off Johnson's nose so he could see his eyes.
The fourth victory after Kliček's return
Klitčko remained undefeated after the fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008.
After almost a four-year break, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to hand in without a fight before.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreol of the United States in September.
In this fight I only got one shot and physically in good shape, I justified Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of WBO and IBF.
But the WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye, after he deposed 2.13 meters high Nikolai Vulaev in November.
Haye canceled the fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
Apparently, his promoter company is planning a fight against Klitko at the London Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: The head of the Green Jürgen Tritin faction called Guttenberg a liar because of bad information about Kunduz's defense minister affair.
SPD and Linke (Levice) are calling on the Chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the attack on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed deliberate deception.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously false", said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction on Saturday's ARD news show "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual term: he lied.
The killing order was issued in disregarding the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Tritin.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not just about the destruction of kidnapped trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's investigation, as many as 142 people were killed or injured during the American air raid requested by the German commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Federal Assembly and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel needs to explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Assembly - and whether the Office of Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service approved this new strategy, called on Jürgen Tritin and a colleague of the Greens Renate Künast.
Ulrich Wilhelm, a spokesman for the government, certainly rejected criticism.
The Office of the Chancellor has no influence on the particular deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there were also loud doubts about the Ministry's report on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on tanks.
Officially, it was said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, it was said from the vicinity of both senior officials that the Ministry of Defence pointed out several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that in the meantime Wichert should have asked in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The Ministry did not comment on the criticisms on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Committee of Inquiry of the Federal Assembly, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in a watchful state and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
Not just mentally ill or intoxicated drugs are the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with wildest fantasies and fantasies.
However, those who are awake in dream states see and hear things that others do not see and do not hear are usually paid for by a fool or a drug addict in the Western world today, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in the drug use.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels will make sure that the boundaries between dream, fantasy, and reality come together.
Dreams of altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in better cases we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the vision of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of raving, psychosis and hallucinations can be deduced from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when the balance of the brain's neuronal transmitters - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction between the various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenia.
Gravity doesn't have power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has employed philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle saw hallucinations as a form of a waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great similarity of raving with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "psychoses, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions of senses".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and loud-colored.
Gravity has no power over him, hovers at the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with bloody red grimaces, weighing teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, fiery shoes, throwing him against walls, feeling pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices are threatening from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that call him names and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, locks them in a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
Loop's okay.
Learn, the choir's voices are tearing his eardrums apart, "go to the clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henningu T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD has been activated.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, besides being manic-depressive, taking antidepressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
Spectres are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get schizophrenic at least once in their lives; in psychiatric clinics it is after the depression of the second most frequently treated disease.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the affected cannot usually distinguish the internal and external world, they are in an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
The hearing of voices is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations aren't uncommon.
The disabled is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as a dream opens up psychosis of the flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is concentrated on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizofrenik is located in the center of the action, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, it enters a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
A comparison with reality is usually not possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of experience takes place in real terms.
Scientists are still facing a riddle as to why our brains are doing these flips.
Exceptional states can lead every person to lose their relationship with reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
Not everyone evolves into psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development there will be damage to the brain’s neural maturation, such as the mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle as to how a neural system malfunctions, which has not manifested itself for many years.
The role also plays the influences of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if there is a disposition.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When Our Brains Is Confused
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irrereale Welt in unserem Kopf".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depression also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brain of a healthy person is hallucinating under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Casten, consist of content of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or too little suppressed; if our brain is engulfed, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries with love or other other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of the respondents reported that they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Front Pomerania and going to the gymnasium there.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If there weren't any patterns and voices.
On breaks, she may be approached by a cocoon with long, dark hair.
When he answers, his classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This shy girl thinks she's an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows that.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather depressing.
Often delusions are a burden.
When he sits in class, he can't watch a lot of lessons because a teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the mathematical equation board.
At night, appearances are rather depressing.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he often cannot tell whether he is awake or whether he is asleep, whether the images he sees are grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet are formed before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends anything about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone crazy.
The illusions are also the art of despair
If anyone is socially isolated or has been removed from their stimuli, they will most likely hallucinate, says Kasten.
I guess the brain doesn't have enough jobs and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she's called Dad since she's been thinking is not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas are active, which also process real sensations and sounds, it is hard for the disabled as Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality from each other. "Every experience", says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, also reality is displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to emerge, therefore they act so realistically."
He also evaluates the night dreams of Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations of acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Therefore, Kasten advises their patients to assess hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world of too much consciousness, imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, bitter disease, but it also brings positive creativity - a delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a strange form of altered consciousness to dream.
One-iroidal conditions are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams, which are considered real by the person concerned and cannot distinguish them from the watchful state.
One-iroidal state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
When a man is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by the continuing, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality it is impossible to handle a situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of support for the senses and the transfer of senses in some unbearable situation that allows people to form, to go into loss of consciousness within a moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-iroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a lifesaving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after surgery of the heart valve, followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness went on a few days’ journey, with his body lying still in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he created, visited strange times and places: He becomes an old man bedridden, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles who make narcotics out of blood.
On a motorcycle, the Greek kidnaps him to his own country, surfs a company in the Alps in a hospital bed, meets a Korean mobster.
It sinks completely into imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These internal paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental paths are still clear in years and in irrelevant details.
Even brighter and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oniroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug intoxications show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in a watchful state.
Every change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be rewarding.
The snow may come
Burda
At 27 they're supposed to take over the publishing house kids.
The new head of Kallen publishing house is a temporary solution: long-term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to both of his children, he told SPIEVEL.
Holdings are supposed to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man SPIEVEL.
We've dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is then asked.
The question is, do they have the ability to do that?
It is not possible to put your children in charge of 7500 employees if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the children and the business.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he was withdrawing from the chairmanship of the Board of Directors as of January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the cash register, responsibility for the company’s assets was added and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also direct marketing, Foreign, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge of publishing.
Burd’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is also used to "cross 10, 15 years", said Burda.
Holding should still belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses have no certainty of extinction: "It has always touched companies who have been infected with the desire for capital, which they speculated and thought could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had dreams of world power, says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play world league with "Time", these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and that's when it's appropriate to find out what celebrities wear and adjust their festive wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which is to be noted.
We are making a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa Power Company, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded 'Live Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) sets and will manage the roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and secure mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVEL project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
All in all, the purpose is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project for the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the deployment of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan Government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa's participation in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a quiet period in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is in for a "rest period".
In the economic report of the Prime Minister for 2009, Zapatero summed up the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a competitive roadmap for the automotive sector, we would be looking at a situation of abandonment, the closure of some of our main production companies", said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks to this plan and the wishes of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of calm is envisaged for this industry in the future, which is our main export sector", he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Roadmap for the automotive sector (PIA), identified 800 million for projects of 19 producers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed government support measures and mentioned plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan allowed for a 6% reduction in the average emission level of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a "significant increase" in the entries, namely by "40%" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Car Salon will be opened in Madrid, a space for meetings of professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid also products of all kinds related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious people.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renewal of cars; or Cochera Clásicos, specialized Mercedes Benz.
External competence tests
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sports performances, fitness tests, presentations and auditions.
Competence tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining the sport style
Mazda intends to show that gentleness to the surrounding environment has no negative effect on sports style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start-up system - also baptised as a-Stop-, a device that is currently only available with a petrol engine 2.0 150 horsepower.
This second generation ofMazda3 is characterised by the good characteristics achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent for Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seats, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using the tool and console assembly we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of the style also presented by Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish for a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start-up system is only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desired Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine, because it is characterized by greater comfort while driving and reduced consumption.
As far as equipment is concerned, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment it is important to mention the lane tracking system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, thrust and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, large-screen onboard computer, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was insufficient, this version was equipped with a Pack Premium, for an extra €1,500: adaptable twoxenon light and BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is primarily characterized by the quality of materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not drive more kilometres per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with gasoline 2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is EUR 21.770 for Luxura and EUR 23.270 for tested version - Sportive-.
At this high price Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxurious 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were dazzling more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand 'Nine'.
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
FonPeek promise
Peek is extremely limited, only used for viewing mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine appreciated him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, who was introduced to Le Web yesterday, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited just like its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is about EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or to search eagerly for a coffee shop with WiFi (or Fon connection) so they can view the mail.
The idea with a fixed price rooming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it continues to be called Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offering downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is payable when purchased, not after months.
And that is exactly what I expect will happen in the case of FonPeek, it is the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like that of Peek already established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the point of view of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on the computer.
The color that Michelle loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to become president of the United States, she chose dress and coat in this color, and she chose the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment in his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow green with glittering effects-, in both cases it was a three-piece ensemble - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturias princesses and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which clothing is made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of joining Michelle's position, she used great lace, in Oslo velvet printed.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium high sole, now similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears various hairstyles: this time a bun, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternal problems.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among women of younger years who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Floorship and career of Spanish women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years and results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities due to motherhood.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in the opinion of the number of children according to whether they work or not and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have stable jobs, start living with a partner earlier, sooner give birth to the first child, and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner cohabitation and motherhood, postpone and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years of age with stable employment have the first child on average 3.7 years from the start of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted more of their lives to achieving stable employment and have therefore had to postpone their partnership cohabitation as well as the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the time of starting cohabitation with a partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who is involved in research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting women’s age at the time of marriage and birth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
The differences are also among women of the same generation.
For example, between 35 and 49 years of age, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25,1 or 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education get married and give birth to the first child before they find a stable job, while women with medium or high education go the other way around prefer to get a stable job, before they marry and the birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of the various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm Worth it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant international actresses, thus joins other famous personalities L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penelope Cruz.
Before her entered this selected club actress Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionary of the hut').
The male part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by important personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Prizes
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, former and current - met at the annual award ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicent Poker
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of writers he has encountered in his literary life (and in some cases even in everyday life) in 'Ess Poker' (Alfaguara, an illustration of Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent does not spare fear or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even during repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, like what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of adversity, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote by his own nature, not intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humour, without sense, as if it were a blade of knife that nearly killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been averse to his passion for this woman for 13 years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven in the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey published in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often collapse."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
About himself, he said he was the heir of a landowner from the county, sometimes he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, they were great dreams."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge this man's crazy cry from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the XXth century in his literary form, running from himself and calling out for the future and speaking violently to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'God my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After the effort comes a dream,/ after the storm a calm port,/after the war rest,/after a full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage, he also carried his depression.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was following her among the azaleans or that the birds were singing Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent goes hand in hand with foolishness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else was it about Martin Santos, other than targeting Joyce at Baroja?
What else did Benet want but to have Baroja executed by Faulkner's weapon?
What else did Cela care about but making himself famous at the expense of that man's glory?"
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my 70 - year - old mother passed through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrad County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by and our dog, a hybrid rescued from a pound - weight shelter, kicked twice without saying a word and hurt him badly.
Our indignation is all the more so that we see nothing amusing in such aggression toward a small and defenseless animal, which was also on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she met these individuals on her walk, she began to fear for her own safety, because such a demon-obsessed man who attacked an animal is able to do the same to a woman, child, old man, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint with the nearest police station, but we doubt that it was useful, and, in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly killers were Spanish nationalities.
Indignation moved us to declare this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to young people today when they are having fun tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We don't understand where the right manners went, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both of these operators have informed them today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using the helmet as it is the only means to prevent head injuries or deaths in the event of a motorcycle accident.
According to Michelin, this campaign forms part of their transport safety obligations, which "means more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of the helmet while riding a motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', is the first phase where the signs will be placed in more than 500 repaired motorcycles to get the public's awareness.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety "is a permanent problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is starting to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and what's more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to figures of the patronage organization of producers Anfac and dealers Ganvam.
However, it is better to quarantine a favourable figure, since November 2008 is a very bad period for comparisons and has resulted in a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/cars.
And neither the glooms that damage demand the most, even though private people bought them, were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation must be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the 2000E purchase support did not help much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention persons who are engaged in small and medium-sized businesses' trade licence, who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (kamony and buses).
The sales association assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, it will be with ESP stability control, handbrake auxiliary systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the others have a deadline for eliminating the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, which can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system will detect when the driver steps down.
But he can't always hold this pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car parts, a third of the drivers who had an accident did not hit the brake before the crash and half of them did not take full advantage of the brake strength.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the other hand, this assistance requires maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatal pedestrian-related accidents per year could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more significant-according to calculations would prevent one of the four accidents affecting persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that (by radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, he will be helped to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably 8 April- as Javier Ortega reported, the American manufacturer points out that it will need more time to fulfil the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Evropa, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of each country in which the production facilities are located, may be issued with a delay at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken these days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American producers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wishes to win a Volvo, but is considering the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper operating under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement can be reached with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab is still valid at the end of the year if it fails to be sold.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, thus the weight is only 1.275 kg.
On the basis, first of all, the automatic pull-back roof is in a linen version with manual control, which reduced weight by 21 kg; additional aluminium doors such as GT3 were used, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a weight reduction of another 7 kg; after installing the sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to the lightweight 19-inch wheel another five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with the textile handles means another kilogram.
It is also available with two-component gearbox PDK, one vehicle with a hand-ordered six-stage speed box, mainly on 2nd-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many curves.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
The reduction in mass does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed to asphalt.
On the contrary, we have not tested such a small and light model in a long time, which would also transfer such safety when moving in a curve, even at high speeds.
He's a small athlete able to warm the muscles while driving for a short time until we order him to sprint, brake, and restore the use of the engine...
Whatever we want, driving that's as communicative as accurate, whatever we signal with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound as per will
The sound of a V6 boxer, about 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be increased by the option of a 'sport' and by means of a system that modifies the sound of an engine that was previously used by Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether in suction or recuperation.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
Asphalt of the roads we drive through with Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; yet in some corners we hit the icing and gravel even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the most fun on the market, as it is a little more than simply modifying Boxster S.
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010 for the price of EUR70.831.
'Bag Girl'
Girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, Coco Coco Cocoon icon and occasional 'starlette' at the show 'firma', the singer performs her face as vehemently as Chanel's handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia gave her victory in Israel
The work treasure gained a brilliant victory in 82-91 while hosting on Maccabi Electra’s complicated playground, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus reached the head of her group after a big performance by Mirzy Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29 ratings).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micah with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although they had to suffer to the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great accuracy of the 16-point circuit was much involved in the final triumph.
The match began with a front for the blue team, who have been on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, which indicated that they had attacked the Israeli cooperative very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team decided for the internal game Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by whistling and applause when returning to its original assignment to increase the advantage before the beginning of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to prove himself to be the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' in Splitter's assessment indicated that it would not be the best night for Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the least and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that everyone on their field did not win, and 'the hand of Elias' they could win.
Eidson and Pini certainly contributed to the 'yellow' return to the spotlight (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, injured, but not dead at all, needed several precise games to take their breath, and then appeared a machine gun Mirza Teletovic, which three triple almost consecutively and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a soothing number (54-67), which they achieved local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs have cut their skins off in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not let anyone deprive them of their well-deserved results for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter voted out for foul seIvanovic did not hastily and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
The injuries make it impossible to fight Unicaja
Unicaja lost significantly to Olympiacos in Greece and left him the lead of Group B in Eurolize in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga's team has not been intimidated by the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or rival, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The first quarter of the game allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillet Rubia, lit the course with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity ofUnicaja , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourousis , Vujcic and Schortsanitis , turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the fight between US supportBeverley and Williams meant the elimination of both players.
The Greek cooperative began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to Joel Freeland’s injury and three personal mistakes by Carlos Jiménez burdened Unicaja
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, a minute 19.
An Impossible Rematch
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, which, despite losing by 19, proved superior and even managed to balance the difference of the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, a minute 27, which shook the leadership in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to the leadership and triple points Cook and Lewis's contribution left a certain hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to its strength and supremacy in centimetres in its zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja faded and handed over the lead Olympiacos.

Brazil sets the date for Zelaya’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in Honduran's capital, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21st.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge".
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian Government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the election of November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum which he was trying to impose on him by the government "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation has represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment where people take decisions about the future that is uncertain in itself.
The medicine used by central banks for stabilising the market was the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could purchase the assets for deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the gears, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in the return of a reduction in risk yields.
Stock exchange mobility and bond differences have regained points, although they are still very distant from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk, which once again affected public debt.
Once again, it is pushing for quality, and the US, Japan, and Germany have become a haven for elected investors, which has expanded the differentiation of euro area countries against Germany.
Spain was almost not affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduced qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useful for muzzling moral-risk advocates who have tried to re-burden the conscience of those responsible for the world's economic policy because of the dampening of the devastating consequences of cutting down on employment credit when, in fact, a new Thanksgiving day would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emir to restore power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, the elections, and a new government is taking over.
Prodi did this in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member countries to fail to fulfil their commitments.
But what makes sense is that Ecofin forces the Greek Government to be transparent and commit its own citizens to joint responsibility when emergency measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the period of normalisation of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in the supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we need not be concerned.
If European differences are reduced and ours continue to expand, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their rise scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not hold much hope for the Spanish economy to live through this warning.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "carefully, friend driver".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first yesterday to intervene before the House of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy is being discussed in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by the appearance of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made several comments to the press on the proposal that he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and an additional 60,000 million from that date to 2030 if nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections
Since 2020, the issue has changed and we will need to increase performance.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, he believes that there is a need for new 18,000 MW, but with other "supportive energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft law on the sustainable economy, which has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line that the company demanded, did not want to run through the veins as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate change policy.
In his view, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "accurate" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start to be adopted now, because their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for airport land services, Swiss company Swiss, will play the role of preferential partner of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
An agreement that has not yet resulted in economic terms has been valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol to create a Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures yesterday
The association envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is Ferrovial.
Research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports will be one of the tasks of the Centre.
Acciona strives for its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the motorway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The construction involved is an estimated tunnel of $1,700 million in Australian dollars (about EUR 1.047 million).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
A tunnel of 5 kilometers long in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for Acciona to settle in that country as a construction and concession highway.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to initials in English) for further development of the project in the business plan covered by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of tolls.
Tenders are expected to be submitted in May and the envisaged investment will reach $1,700 million (EUR 1.047 million) and at the last stage, three companies with significant presence in European constructions compete.
The group called Transcity is led by Accion, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second is one of the largest European specialists in underground constructions.
Against the Acciona Group, the Northern Direct Group is in play with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French Bouygues Building Group.
The third and last company, which passed through the sieve, has the name LBRJV and includes the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented by ACS), also the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and an important company specialized in civil constructions Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatisations, but it entails a clear difficulty in entering in a way other than the meditative acquisition of the local construction company.
Besides Asian references, the strategy followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted company Leighton.
Million-dollar assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities of the energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria runs a group of companies that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and operate infrastructures.
The underground road subject to toll, whose promoter is the Brisbane Infrastructure Office, called Northern Link (north coupling), is to connect the western motorway from Toowong with the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the biggest event to reduce the traffic congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to enter summer 2010 and start work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would have opened in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel started to design in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide $500 million of Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this order to Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit, since yesterday it announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
ACS shares the infrastructure of the national wide-band network with fibre optic cable.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the construction project of the King George Tower on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction works were just about to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC was assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpine file, the FCC received an allocation of EUR 64.5 million for the €2.1 km long tunnel for the motorway in Slovenia.
The company obtained the contract a few days after the completion of works to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Shit. Rushmore got a commercial in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services over the last two years to Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros per year, informed the railway company.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sr. Rushmore has been selected among 16 agencies, which were presented in the audition of Renfe, of which four have advanced to the finals, among them TBWA , which has been responsible for creating advertising over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of designing and producing campaigns.
Fine 63 million for France Télécom for braking competition
The competition regulator in France fined lFrance Télécom EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes with consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this sanctions, the former French monopoly and the state company still bought more than EUR 560 million of fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to their competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was in fact increased because the Authority, which oversees the competition, considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that, therefore, there has been a recurrence.
Application shop
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened up an online app shop in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought from the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Barçe
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made $476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
Manchester United leads the bill.
Manchester United leads the bill.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
Up to the point that the competition divided EUR 5,362,5 million between 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) that participated in this event since the tournament started in 1992/1993, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money it won for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won three times the main prize.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the defunct Europe Cup in 1992 is the fifth in the classification.
The list is run by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two teams, which, moreover, charged the most money to participate in the previous Champions League.
Even though she lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has won the most money through Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by the complex process of distributing the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to make $1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (among others Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have achieved participation received 3.8 million for their presence only, in addition to an additional EUR 550,000 for each match they participate in.
There is also a bonus for winning ($800,000) and a draw ($400,000 for each team). Eight-finalists get three million each; eight quarter-finalists get 3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion makes $9 million, while the second finalist makes 5.2 million.
This way, the club will earn at least 7.1 million on fixed payments and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided by the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the principals and has four assigned seats.
The champion of last year will receive 40% of allotted money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group published yesterday details of the offer of the purchase of shares, with which it wants to acquire a peak between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not oblige the public bid to be made for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share that would be paid in ten years and would pay interest for this deferral of 1% per year.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended in trading at EUR 1.85; therefore, Nueva Rumasa's offer assesses the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The tender shall be subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would be 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible offers to buy and settle court fluctuations of his former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazars, the election of María Luisa Jorda as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes it the first woman to occupy a high office in a food business.
It's a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the enterprise continues to be immersed in the legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos to the Salazar brothers.
In fact, it is impossible to shred the possibility that Sos will reveal new transfers of funds in the coming months
As far as Salazar credit is concerned, the former members of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega Council (CCM and Unicaja) testified yesterday at the National Court and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the option to exclude Paternina participating in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised the exclusion of Inversora Mer against Federico Paternino on October 9.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorised this operation because it understands that its conditions correspond to the standards in force and considers that the "sufficient" content of the explanatory brochure submitted following the adjustments introduced on 2 December is sufficient.
CNMV stated that the offer was aimed at acquiring EUR 7.65 for Federica Paternina’s 550.08 shares per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, which consists of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5.592.778 million shares were immobilised, which would not be able to be transferred in any way until a tender was concluded, specifying that the price was fixed by Federice Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New instruments for car valuation
These days, storms and accidents don't just earn car service.
Each day thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are towed to a service where the expert has to estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of the workforce can be long and difficult work.
Calculate manually the cost of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the connoisseurs use this kind of system.
Service suppliers and solutions for the estimation of insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audatax, from the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is performed with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, sales director of Audatax, 63 producers and importers work in Spain and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing has been increasing as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been listed in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is a very feverish work, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing" is performed for each model, where it is possible to "pull" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to the minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatax has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about are Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini, for example.
They're over 99% on the fleet.
Audatax has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) to document and develop databases, each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work together with three computer screens.
Audatax invests EUR 90 million a year in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but by country there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide to inform about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatax doesn't offer them in our country, but it does in the United States.
With regard to the products offered by Audatax, it is easy to get the support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, a standard solution for the valuation of insurance events intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the paint shop.
This tool is valid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it little, up to 10 times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatax.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow full identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to disable vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying the trend, carrying out geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a certain brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many serious insurance events have suffered over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of instrument.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solution of damage assessment, accidents or car maintenance
Gt Guía Valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and accounted for EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year began the process of internationalization of office installations in Paris.
Audatax was established in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the resources of the company 62% of her brother is established in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The World Invoicing Group Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1,000 million on the stock market, and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation envisaged the subscription of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively provided to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, sales of spare parts and professional dealers who must register before the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily advertisements, and on the Spanish market, about 100 new advertisements are added every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been disabled cannot be put back into service but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Wagons with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been discarded, after the preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user will receive the budget in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for a replacement part, creation of the budget and generation of the budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of professionals of older age who are more or less restrained when using new management techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, of which tourist 666, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with Internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphic display of the model appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, surcharge or discounts, and then print and pass on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an instrument for valuation as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is oriented towards service and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatax is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics welcome, because it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it around to show the inside.
