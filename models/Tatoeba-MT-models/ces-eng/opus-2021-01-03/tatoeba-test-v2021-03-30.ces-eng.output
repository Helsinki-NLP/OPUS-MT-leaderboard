Tom turned right, and Mary went the other way.
There's one left.
He started explaining what happened.

Mother didn't know what to do with her son.
He knows the wine.

Where have you been all afternoon?
You found yourself a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high tip on the table.
Nothing like a glass of beer after a day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm happy with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
I'd ask him if I were you.
Leave them for us.
Here's my map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting when I got invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were probably dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
The dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight ahead and then to the right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?

Remember what she was like?
My belt's too tight.
Playing the bassoon isn't easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly dying out these days.
Tom's still busy.
You'd better leave now.
Tom's childless.
I like to read.
We cut off the rope.
I'm sorry to bother you, I just came by to apologize.
Tom can't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.

I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.

Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you buy me a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I'm not surprised when that happens.
He's single.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a flea when she got the record deal.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you helped us.

I'm perfectly happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your dad's name?

Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about divorcing her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else reading it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own two feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we had a laugh.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better dead than red to live.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It'd be great if you did that for me.

The horse is giggling.
I loaned Tom a comb.
