Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco.
The 28 - year - old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says that he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding: “Finally, he has begun to prosper. ”
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, reports the medical examiner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC KGO station in San Francisco that Frank, who was a former line cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
The spokesman at Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close family. We will miss them very much," the spokesperson said.
In these difficult times, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first stayed in the dorms, but that he had recently “become successful. ”
"He found an apartment, dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any argument.
He was a brother who took things for what they were.
"Even if everything else in the world were wrong, he was an uncut diamond that irradiated every day," he said.

České dráhy invested over 31 billion in modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernisation of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually falling.
In the last six years, ČD has invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernisation of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was placed by the carrier in regional transport, which was about 60 percent of the money, and 40 percent was invested in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of ČD's propulsion vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger wagons are slightly older, whose average age is 23 years when they are set up for modernisation.
If only the age from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
However, in recent years, classic train sets consisting of wagons and towed locomotives have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotives fell from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic wagons fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in mid-year.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles scrapped.
From the investments that ČD plans to make in the car park in the near future, it is possible to include, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or the framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic express trains.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 motor units and 20 electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online daily Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where it is not only a touristic walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads all over the country.
According to officials, there's a flimsy law to blame, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complicated bureaucratic circle is needed first.
In the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or you just have to move the ad a few yards, and the official process has to start over.
The Roads and Motorways Directorate admitted a quarter ago: at the main turn from České Budějovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard stands black on our property near the state road.
Three months, however, were not enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares that they're standing right next to the road in a 50-metre protection zone where nothing can happen for safety.
Road managers say they can't easily deal with a billboard because of a leaky law.
Maybe load him up and take him away.
"We must not afford that," says Nina Ledvinová, spokesperson for Road and Motorway Directorate, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to follow the online daily Aktuálně.cz in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot effectively and quickly solve.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to the road or near it.
Similarly, there are other regions.
"We are having trouble getting the company to remove the banners," says Jiří Klása, head of the Transport Department of the České Budějovice Regional Office, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klása, there is a leaky law that binds officials.
First, he has to address the billboard owner in a difficult way to put away the ad.
But the leaders of the companies are often underachieving or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz described in the past, when he became more interested in the issue: just move the mobile stand with advertising a few meters and the officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertising into the trash.
That's because the Bureau has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we must address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
A new law could bring about change, which will ban billboards by motorways from September next year and will limit them even on the I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertisements will remain the same as they have been.
And the authorities won't be relieved.
Companies can thus continue to make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year in renting illegal areas and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard that attracts Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the České Budějovice Magistrate is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with it for blackboarded billboards.
The company is facing a 300,000 fine in each proceeding.
These are more advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of the 1st class road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the České Budějovice Magistrate.
The advertisement that Aktuálně.cz is interested in, although it is not yet working among these cases, but it will most likely be added to them soon.
According to spokesperson Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will reach the regional and then probably the municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
She did not take over the post office and cancelled the official residence in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind her.
In the past, the company's post office went to South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of Czech Hyundai brand representation.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents and offers space from Comerz Billboard to advertisers, has refused any connection in the past.
This spring, when ŘSD started to take an interest in advertising for Lipno, Fischer sent a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his boarding house, where the company is allegedly newly established.
Even from this address, no one has heard from highway managers.
It's a futile fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes in residences are not uncommon.
Some years ago, we gradually fined one company for two million crowns.
But she changed her name and ID, and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor returned the case, the commercials kept going, maybe in other places.
We're pretty powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admitting anonymity to one of the officials.
No one has yet dealt with the amendment to the law in this regard.
Currently.cz has spoken to several Members who have taken an interest in the problem.
But so far, they haven't developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the term for the preservation of billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national but also regional and municipal policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't stand for the rather established impression that when something doesn't work, there's a need to change the law.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rape and poppy seed are estimated by statisticians.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the grain harvest will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
Yet this year’s crop has exceeded the average for the last five or ten years.
On the other hand, the rapeseed harvest (3.9 percent) and poppy seed (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Cereal harvest will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
Farmers reap 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth drop against last year.
But last year's grain harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average for the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, this year’s harvest of rape and poppy will be higher.
The beet growers will reap 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1,256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decline in cereal production is due to both a reduction in hectare yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the rotational area.
This year, farmers have assed three percent less fields.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to reap 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers planted it in more fields.
However, a lower yield per hectare will be signed on the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Roughly a one-fifth drop in statistics is assumed by spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
A reduction of 15.2 percent of the crop yield, as well as a lower hectare yield, is behind the crop reduction.
On the other hand, winter barley will yield 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also grow.
The production of rapeseed is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than that against last year.
The enclosures have expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectar yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s rape crop exceeds the 10 year average by 13.3 percent, sown on an area a third more extensive than it was ten years ago.
The fields of poppy seed have also increased over the past four years.
This year, farmers planted it on 35.543 hectares.
The year 2008 when poppy seed in the Czech Republic was grown on record 70,000 hectares, but there are half fields.
This year's harvest of poppy seed will be richer thanks to the expansion of the rotational areas.
It will rise by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons against last year.
But the hectar yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
The senior police charged two men with knife and machete assault, the court sent them into custody.
Police charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the victim tried to escape, they caused him a cutting and cutting injury, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," said police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
Both apparent perpetrators were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a court order to take them into custody and the court approved him on Friday.
Both men are facing three to ten years in prison.
The police charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him severe and cut injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which took place on Tuesday at noon at the Freedom Class, reported by the police.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed Olomouc police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
A mass skirmish between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked with a knife and a machete of a 35 - year - old man.
Even though the assaulted man tried to escape, they caused him a cutting and cutting injury, which required hospital treatment and further treatment, the police spokesperson said.
In a brawl that attracted great attention in the city centre, and for which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the spot, there were family disputes.
Criminalists accused a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc of attempted serious bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a court motion to take them into custody, and the court approved him on Friday, adding a spokesman.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass fight also five years ago, it happened only a few tens of meters away, before the disco Varna in Riegrove Street.
The police then stated that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company who were standing outside the entrance.
Police say they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking foreigners with conditional punishment.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk by them every day.
One of the loudest examples of an untapped and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné náměstí.
It should have been a hotel by now.
But still nothing.
That you need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings, which, despite their location, size and often even monument protection, are only desolate and are empty.
We have selected properties in the centre using the project Emptydomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

The Clinton husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year.
They donated over a million dollars to Clinton for charity.
Most of the Clinton income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
American Democrats’ candidates for Hillary Clinton’s presidential office released their tax returns on Friday, increasing the pressure on their Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP agency.
Most of the Clinton income - over six million dollars - is behind their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that last year, Clinton’s husbands paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent, followed by a government and local income tax of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump, however, has a problem with a similar step, has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There's a possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after she released her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrets surrounding Trump’s income, including to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is as rich as she claims to be, said AP.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower profit would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Caine, who is running for Vice President in tandem with the former First Lady, has published today a report on his tax contributions for the last ten years.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their charity earnings and paid 25.6 percent of their taxes last year.
In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented consistent vaccinations and killed doctors.
Cases of polio have reappeared in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared an emergency vaccination because two children infected with this disease were paralyzed.
Vaccines brought in helicopters.
Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended vaccinations and even killed doctors, worked in the affected area.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, an emergency polio vaccination will begin because two children were paralyzed by this disease.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be inoculated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
On Friday, according to the AP agency, Nigeria’s military helicopters quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the virus had been circulating undetected in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach the areas where polio children were found.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the eradication of polio Michel Zaffran told BBC station that vaccination in Nigeria will start next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long worked in the state of Borno.
The area was only made available to international organisations and to the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to significantly weaken this part of the country.
Nigeria’s health minister Isaac Adewole admitted that new cases of polio are a great disappointment to the country because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated.
WHO pointed out that although the disease did not appear for two years, it was spreading among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all polio cases in the world were in Nigeria.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the emotional stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from the pimp gang thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their hard life stories and urged them to look forward with confidence.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking by this meeting and call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes in Rome, who were freed by the police from the power of the pimp gang.
For over an hour, the head of the Catholic Church listened to the emotional stories of the fallen women and then invited them to look into the future with confidence, stating the Vatican’s spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes that Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one from Tunisia, Italy, and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to violent physical violence during forced prostitution.
By visiting, František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for an increase in the fight against it, said the Pope's spokesman.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican this April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will strike at Jihadist factories.
But it will not work without the help of the Muslims.
Muslims themselves are supposed to help France fight radical Islamism.
Moreover, Prime Minister Manuel Valls’ government is preparing major changes in the functioning of the mosques and the education of the clergy.
Since last December, we closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms.
And others will follow, announced by the Home Secretary.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state to fight those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this religion of freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams who educated in France preach in mosques and mosques.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, most of them from Morocco, Algeria, and the Gulf countries.
Because of this, preachers who can sow radicalism in France also enter the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam, founded by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, now operates in the country.
Already then, the Foundation should have contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon hit by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It is a total failure," Valls recently said.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate about the new institution that will replace the dysfunctional foundation was on fire on the French political scene.
Other terrorist attacks in France, which radicalized Islamists carried out in the name of the Islamic State, has accelerated everything.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently let himself know that the new foundation will be established this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centres.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal foods.
In practice, salesmen would pay halal meals to provide certification.
Part of this money would then go to the foundation's register.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them go to a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should operate in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is consistent with democracy.
Let's close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is campaigning against radicals.
And others will follow, announced recently by the Home Secretary.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
About 2500 mosques and mosques are estimated to be operating in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams and consider it for several other tens.
But not everyone thinks that government action can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Dr. Kelemen lost a sprint to the star of Baugem in the first round.
The Czech race cyclist must fight for the advance to the eight-finals in correcting rides.
At the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, Dráho cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost a race with French giant Grégory Baugé in the 1st round following the sprint qualification procedure in the 18th round, defending silver from previous games in London.
The advance to the eight-finals must be fought in correcting rides.
27 riders were put on the start of the royal discipline on the track, and the best Czech runner of the day added the fourteenth best time.
He made the 200 with a quick start in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase he was expected in qualification fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Kelemen, however, at the end of the day, was harassing an experienced Frenchman, but he kept an eye on the procedure.
The gold defender Jason Kenny flashed with a great performance.
Eighty-five-year-old Britt made the third fastest 200 history and won his qualification in the Olympic record of 9.551.
As expected, he also dealt with the last successor, the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4 km fighter race and advanced to the finals.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which belonged to the British for four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Push: Want a fresh wind in the field
Representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over the new treaty.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire board for support for other field events from early September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issues regarding the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58 % of its members participating in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "still silent" on the questions, which was very much to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the executive authority of the JDC decided, by voting on the proposed new treaty, to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to ask for new formal negotiations on all matters."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board formally asked for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve the running programme of exacerbated trade events from early September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to announce until six strikes, including the first general strikes in the history of NHS.
The director of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
He told the BMA members at the pre-vote meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would put a burden on the medical staff in England.
Russia and Turkey: the alliance of the "uninstructable"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of the eight months-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the luxurious palace hall in St. Petersburg, I was under the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile and barely radiate warmth, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “dear friend” to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted like nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was fierce.
Putin was beating around him and accused Ankara of putting a knife in Moscow's back.
The scandal was all the greater that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media has been running a massive campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious were accusations from top state officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But there was an official message in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared what a victory you also had.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during a failed coup last month, and therefore he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have obviously shaken it too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions had a hard impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey each year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly rest here when flights are renewed.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the report in the newspaper Leadstoy.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what she thinks is a lame reaction to an attempt at a coup.
Moreover, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about EU accession and Putin's accession - which is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after attempting a coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it's a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described to me as “a union of incompatible”: how two countries join forces that feel rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite publicly showing reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently put itself in the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of opening talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a complete disaster, when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders are talking to each other again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be suppressed in the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of them, it was eased when it nearly died eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was worth millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Winbledom Champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not start new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding, will be changed to NatWest.
Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that get more to the fore - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our trips to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
The BBC Scotland station said: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and brand for which our employees work, because we are now much more a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts aimed at the home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something quite different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship, it has prepared a profile of individual brands of sport sponsorship.
"The time has come for us to move on to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we said we were going to become a great customer bank and introduce those brands.
But along with how we focused on customers' needs, and not our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind you of these signs, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket riding Predilection led to the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was reached by his second victory of the evening on his local track - riding Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden.
Forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
A three-time champion, Dettori, who had previously won on the horse Ghayyar, said: “It’s strange.”
I'm very touched because my family's here too.
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I docked 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when after the win brings Predilection
Two jockeys reached this milestone in the obstacle course - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time pension champion Sir Anthony McCoy, which during his career breaking records led to the finish of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 career winners
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of the modern age, and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical fiddle that separates him from the other riders in the dragonfly.
He's a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't been driving only on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie drove a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's got a lively nature, which is good for British racing sports, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous fleeting jump
From a fleeting finish to a fleeting jump - Frankie Dettori was the messenger of the British plane racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
He survived a plane crash and was banned for drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated when he returned after a six-month ban, but showed incredible inner strength and all the doubters despite returning in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has already said that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released the president's office of Sergei Ivanov
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from his post as president of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest associates for many years.
63-year-old Ivanov was appointed a special representative for ecology and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “freed Ivanov from his service as head of the Russian presidential office,” but there was no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno used to be a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (Russian) states that he later became head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State in terms of draft laws and control of the extent to which your instructions are followed.
On Friday, Putin told the Russian television station that Ivanov had asked to relieve him of his post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Convince smiles?
This step has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest associates and, like Putin, he worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast by state television, both men declared that he was leaving the presidency at his own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once thought of as a possible president yearned to lead Russia’s environmental policy suddenly met with great mistrust.
The Kremlin’s website quotes Putin’s remarks: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very challenging post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was president of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as its representative.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could become Putin’s successor to the state after his second term, because the third period would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin’s, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Thoughts of the Criminal, was released after he hit the director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his firing.
There have been creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in the statement.
According to the statements from ABC and CBS TV stations, the details of how Gibson's character disappears from a series that follows the stories of an FBI team of agents a little later.
Fifty-four-year-old actor, who has been famous for the main roles in the Dharma and Greg sitcom, has performed in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the ideas of the criminal, and over the last 12 years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in his statement, which he issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it till the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, to the great fans that this show could ever have hoped for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28th.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed fish in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish can be sand eels left behind by a waterstorm.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his discovery on the Periscope channel, thinking that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects to Fife.
So it is the first of the four caps between the "platform fans", which are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all see how construction engineers in an impressive way used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In its place is now a total of 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now poured out in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first lock on each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of the building industry.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expansion platform North Tower, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be dragged up about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being flushed by water from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station announced an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. on British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men were trying to swim to safety while their boat continued unbridled.
"We saw their boat circling near them and we thought the worst of it," said the pilot of the lifeboat Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happily, the strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man 60 years old was found without a life jacket exhausted holding a buoy.
They've all been taken aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and unharmed.
The engine of the ship had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when it was rolled over.
Someone upstairs held a protective hand over those boys.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of Fat Man's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the prosecution, were to receive from Prime Minister Nečas and his then cabinet chief Jana Nagyová a political newsstand, a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Snajdr, Fuksa and Fat Man allowed him to resign with their resignations.
Then they showed up at influential positions in state companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were wrongly compensated for almost 2 million crowns.
A deaf man now performs as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Yet, Judge Helena King wants to be cautious and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another Prague court district.
The King's acquitted Jana Nečas, formerly Nagy, twice.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
The Fat Man didn't work in this case.
According to Jaroslav Ortman's lawyer, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think impartiality cannot be interpreted as such to rule out a court if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge at all, he wrote for the journal.
"It seems crazy to me," he said.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged with the case of political news.
According to his lawyer, Petr Toman, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 discussed the indictment of former chief of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagy (today Nečasová) and others in the case of abuse of Military intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová and her husband are coming to trial.
Fatty was supposed to deal with Peroutka's statements.
For example, the wife of the exposé was to judge President Miloš Zeman’s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She and her two same old girlfriends flew to Syria last February from London Gatwick Airport.
The British Interior Ministry did not comment on her death.
According to police, young Londoners who escaped from home were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana, according to the media, headed to their other former classmate from the London school of Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year, the case caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred thousand bucks.
A well-paid job you don't even need college for.
That's what the I.T. guy looks like at first glance.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only for Czech conditions of extremely high pay (in Prague you earn up to CZK 180 000 in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the staff agency Grafton, programmers, developers, networking engineers and application specialists are among the most wanted.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Thus, not competing candidates for a job position, but job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College isn't a necessity.
College education is not a necessity for IT students.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and education, but it often has little in common with knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which will not be replaced by a university, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
It is the most profitable in Prague.
I.T. payrolls move high above the Republic average everywhere.
The most money will come to them in Prague and Brno, it is no longer such a hit parade in the regions.
"Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubaèka confirms.
Technical Directors will be able to make the highest profit.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80 000.
IT project managers are also requested.
They can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZK on arrival.
The fight is for alumni.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not true of the IT team.
In fact, if companies are to drag over and overpay an expert from another company, they will be happy to reach for a graduate.
Because they can raise him their own way.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but it is necessary for IT students to have at least decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking especially for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
For example, if a support worker has more foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, added by the director Kubačka.
Yeah, in Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly envious Czech workers can Google employees.
Of course for them is flexible working time, possibility of working from home or various abbreviated jobs, not only for mothers.
"The company provides new dads with four extra weeks of vacation after the birth of the child," says Martina Joneková, Google Spokeswoman.
The pampering also involves health care for employees and family, catering, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Who wants to learn, has the green light, and no matter what new he wants to learn.
But that does not end the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator free of charge is definitely not to be discarded.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microcuisines in all the offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And in order for nothing to have to be thrown away, what it doesn't eat is put in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these on Czech conditions of incredible advantages?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions," says the spokesperson.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
On Thursday, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The Bulgarian Government's official strategy "instigates serious concern about Bulgaria's non-compliance with international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures express public support for criminal armed fighting, which are brazenly holding pursuits of refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross the Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested in an irregular manner," Zeid emphasized.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned for a year or longer if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone under international law has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21 000.
Pokémon Go - a quest for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time over screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off couches and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally reduced to television, later to video games, and most recently to smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a matter of days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players on the smartphone go out looking for Pokémon who are tracking through GPS, and when they find them, they can “photograph” (via screenshot on the phone) or “capture” them.
Mania seized a generation that played the game when they were younger, lifting it out of the seats, and driving out looking for the Pokémon.
Thanks to this game in the US, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps a "average" person takes every day.
The Apple Smart Watch Cardiogram, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported to Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people who practiced every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go is playing - they only see rough data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns to "find 30", "get off the couch", and "have been active every day" fell on barren soil, because most messages aimed at public health are boring and designed for people who do not look good.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot present here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some even make new friends chasing pokémon.
As it happens, of course, there are those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can come through the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps, like Fitbit, could track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do anything like this game.
The news is looking at it, and interest in it will begin to fade at some point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, other games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles has won gold in the multi-fight of women gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic jump.
No effort on the beam.
In the plains, they were all speechless.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
Nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday to the title in the multi-fight and beat the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlights.
Overall result 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over the silver medalist and member of the team “final fives” Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafinová.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during the performance on the beam in the finals of the individual multi-fight in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row who won the multi-fight, and fifth overall when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey until now ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of unique athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, won 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold medals. Her stunning routines are a mixture of ambition and precision and Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Retton called her the "best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between her and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be seen as disappointing.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hugs after winning the gold and silver medal in the female multi-fight final of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was like an exclamation point at Martha Karolyi's outgoing national team coordinator.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her routine in simple rooms - the one that contains a typical triple flip for her with a double twist - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, in the streets off the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and where she gained strength.
The multi-fight has not lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a sequence of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina took the lead for a short time with two turns, it was an illusion.
The hammer and the simple - where Biles advocates the World Championship - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points for the beam - and she finished with 15,933 points in the plain.
Raisman hugged her gently, waiting for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white and blue shadows, the Biles appeared tears when the wishes she had once written in her diary came true.
Raisman's performance was kind of payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafina, but then she eats bronze for the sum of the three best sets.
This time, 22-year-old team captain, who Americans call "grandmother", was way ahead of us.
After her simples, she sent air kisses to the crowd, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where she became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl 12 years old died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix, being shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities have announced that Angela Rochelle Linger, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead in a car parked in the driveway on June 12.
The report states that the armed man was on the passenger side and fired eight shots from the handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
Police say it's not worth a triple homicide robbery because the attacker didn't take his wallets, or the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had on her.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were checking to see if the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
A total of nine attacks took place in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods within four months, with seven people killed and two others injured.
"This is happening in the residential area in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO branch of CBS.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late '90s, a black BMW from the late '90s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died on the scene.
The Witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was targeted by an empty van just half an hour before the triple homicide, and the police believe that the serial killer was the source of the shooting.
Investigators found shell casings and bullet residue in the seat and put a bullet under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephalia: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and of course also his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephalia, a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I first thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are prepared for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund may never know them and that he may not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do that anymore," Picciutová explains.
Edmund's walking with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
But some milestones are already slowly filling.
He's been walking around with his bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is doing a sign language with which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciutová for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciutová recalls the emotional tax that the uncertain future takes.
I keep asking, “What happens next? ”
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me.
Picciutová, however, has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and southern Mississippi would spill from their shores and face widespread floods.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they were getting applications for vehicles to ride in the water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only Tangipah's district asked for 10,000 sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service stated in the statement that it could rain more than 8 to 13 centimetres over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on alert on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of Mobile.
According to the forecast, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are supposed to curl up this weekend.
Meteorologist Alec Krautmann said that both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that floods downstream in the Ascension district were a danger, when these flowing flows would only slowly be poured into Lake Maureenpas.
The Tickfaw River, a little further south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached local time at the highest recorded levels on Friday at 9 a.m.
Paramedics are still picking up people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among the saved at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said his other stepson, who lives nearby, alerted him.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it all the way to my waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced on a river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all of his family are disabled, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to the Gloster fire station, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, the floods are spreading rapidly, and the authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that between midnight and Friday morning, 35 centimeters of rainfall fell.
Krautmann said the soil has been soaking heavily since Wednesday.
The authorities stated that heavy rain and paid trips required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
According to the Tangipahoo Elder, 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals trapped by high water.
In Amite and Hammond, shelters were established for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to fall," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipaho district of Hammond because of the flood, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last major floods here in March," said the manager of Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in Harrison, Mississippi, said that persistent rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said a couple of houses had been reported to be flooded on Thursday, but none of them showed up on the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot to death", survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it's the second shooting at a child aged 6 in the city.
The baby's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahai Brown.
Grandparents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms, and abdomen, but was conscious during transport to the hospital.
"He took so much, his little body was shot to death," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, to the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and underwent several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was supposed to be in primary school first class.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men 29 years of age is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia there are two other victims in stable condition.
According to the station report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia reported that there was probably a firefight between several armed men.
On the scene, shell casings were found from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault-type weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," said the station captain of the Philadelphia Police Anthony Ginaldi.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No one's been arrested, and the police are supposedly looking at video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a stray bullet on Tuesday outside the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I picture the women's gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And two, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also consolidated the presence of blacks and Latino women at the peak of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second rungs last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became an Olympic champion, and America rejoiced.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who demonstrated unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who won gold in the female multi-fight of individuals.
And a member of Aly Raisman's team got the silver.
We're witnessing a sports peak, but in gymnastics class in the country, it doesn't look like it.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnast team for the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnast clubs that keep parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travels, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, both trained athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or at low cost in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (particularly black and Hispanic) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, achievements at school and at work.
It's the inspiration this team will send to us thousands of young girls who want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving "girl strength" and winning the Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the young doctors are ready to enter the next strike.
The ministers hoped that after concluding the revised agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be an end to disagreements about changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract in July, with NHS being in "no one's country" and further delays having a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend working procedures in order to improve care in non-social hours.
In a statement last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Young Doctors, stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and therefore fair treatment of all doctors. ”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new treaty, progress is needed and time is running out.
The efforts of the BMA to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with a reluctance to engage Dr and often with deafening silence from the government.
In spite of Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement and resolve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after concluding the revised agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be disagreements about changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Chairman of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “Only a little or nothing will be achieved by evolved action, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and fears, exhaustion and disruptions for patients, caring staff and their families will rise."
Over the past two months, we have been dealing with the advice of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health, and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as utilization, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay differences - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Health Ministry took the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A 60-kron-a-day cure can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs about 60 crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend that more patients take it for a longer period of time.
The blood clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of relapse in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after having had a heart attack in order to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that people be given the medicine for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the build-up of fat that forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is severed, a blood clot may occur, block blood access to the heart, and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain, and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another seizure.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE Directive, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE health technology assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences. ”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased to be able to extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will benefit from it in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, the proposed treatment beyond this time is not recommended.
With computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim regions
Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was suspended from office last year for corruption, which was linked to the government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, as stated today in the government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises police, electoral inspectors, and city hall for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former secretary of the community, now ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters based on their religion was so bad that the police should put cordons in front of the polls and protect the ostracized voters.
He recommended that voters take along an identity card and prove who they are at the election.
At the moment, voters just need to state their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes applying indelible ink on the fingers of persons when giving their voice in order to prevent anyone voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press be given greater access to documents from meetings and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not just about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from a wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an electoral scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically intervened” in the religious sense of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, “led his campaign so that it was a religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him. ”
Up to 300 votes have been called into question or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives himself up to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the frauds in the correspondence vote - which it is claimed that the older members of the Muslim community, during which he put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, on the photo, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: “Provided evidence has been provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
"There was a concern that... state institutions closed their eyes to such behavior because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondent votes and thus preventing “the extraction of votes.”
The report, now evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present an identity document before the vote.
Using indelible ink on the fingers of people in the vote to avoid anyone voting twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Disable political agitators and activists from manipulating surrendered correspondents and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the polling rooms.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute those who exert illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Law.
Disable taking photos in the polls.
Require only English (except Wales) to work in the polling rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral trial expelled Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For many reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of a crime.
He also criticises the failure of "checking checkboxes" in the voters' registration departments at the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s judgment of the court in the Tower Hamlets case was awakened.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection are threatened by some institutions.
Infatuation by bicycle duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of famous personalities at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Olympic Games in Rio have gone crazy for the French bicyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-seeking athlete this year, who can boast her own double from the ranks of famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities currently appearing on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As hunted game: A member of the American archer team Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCaprio from a young age
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of a star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from a team of U.S. archers Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures came up, with a striking resemblance to a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity with Leo since he was a kid.
"He sees no great resemblance to himself, except perhaps the beard," said Brady for the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between the British jumper to the distance of Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for several years to the star of Gell Matthew Morrison.
And for a change: The user thinks Nathan is an "athletic version" of the actor from "Inception"
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russia's silver swimmer, Yulia Efimov, is not only proud of the same brown skin and blond hair as Annalynne McCord, and Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say he looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Skillful women: Hope Sol’s star football (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter’s (right) have a similar face and eyes shape
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarity
On Waves Theory: According to this user there may be a reason for a similar view of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the website that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical. ”
The football star Hope Sol and the actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or gold medal holder for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which seems to be copying Gabrielle Union's smile, the stars of Bravo, girls!
The CBC Olympic broadcaster apologizes for saying that she "exploded" about a Chinese swimmer.
On Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games at CBC, the performance analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhanová was outraged by commentator Byron MacDonald.
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer pulled like a stink during the race and "exploded."
NARRATOR Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the women's 4x200 meter relay final, he began to spew his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a “revival ” to the CBC commentators, said: “That little 14 - year - old from China gave up, you fool. ”
Too excited, dragged like a stink, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in time 1:57.79 - i.e. 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to catch up to China.
Spectators in Canada began to speak quickly online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted on Twitter: “Did the reporter at the CBC say that a 14 - year - old swimmer from China “exploded?”????
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the finals of the women's relay race at 4x200 meters freestyle was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism came on Twitter from all sides, and many called for his appeal.
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC, apologized for MacDonald’s live commentary and said: “We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped the broadcast. ”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commenter Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and put their apology into the answer for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments by commentator MacDonald
The station also apologized quickly and published a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken. She shouldn't have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments concerned the performance of a swimmer, not a swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his comment by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said in the broadcast from the Olympics at CBC Station.
"I meant the performance of a swimmer and not a person of a swimmer as such."
"There is no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect and I am very sorry."
Customers in Primark outraged by a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman took off her clothes to try on her panties on the sales surface in the middle of Primark, they were not sure which direction to look in.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, took off her panties and put them back in the shelf.
She continued to browse and finally tried four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokestone.
Primark shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that a mysterious woman, after trying on her underwear, “put on her clothes again and left the store without buying anything. ”
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, cheeky as a monkey."
"Everyone just stared at her taking off her panties again, and apparently she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching - nor did she think of the person who might have bought the panties she was trying on."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else was wearing and no one cleaned them.
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that I apparently tried to pull away from the sale - the only thing that was right. ”
"I would be terrified to think that I would bring home new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, took them off and that they were not washed."
Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident at our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9. ”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend yourself against the attack of weapons using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but with this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation, based in New York, to see how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly overtake the rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If they approach you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around and see your attacker and "have a clear shot."
Then you grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows into the groin, and while the attacker writhes in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face, and you start retreating, holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body off the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the scoundrel can't shoot.
At the same time, give force to the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip and start retreating while still aiming at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video, where you will see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of a robbery - unless you're the Grand Master of Krav Maga - is to hand out all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to severe test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and author of travel books Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, to show the strength of his immune system he liked the euro banknote with his tongue, the railing on Piccadilly Circus, the flush button in the toilet on the train and the Russian public phone.
He used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flusher button on the train, which thousands of other people used, may seem utterly repulsive, but perhaps there are many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright, throughout his journey across Europe, talked to doctors and health specialists about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked left him with anything worse in his mouth than an aftertaste.
Ian Wright became famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on travel around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public railings to flushing stations
In a film about it, he says: “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a child, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to worm eating and muddy water. ”
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
All he refused were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made an traveling film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
In the film, he said: “This is almost the ugliest thing I have ever felt in a toilet. ”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the passion and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They say that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I asked him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the movie. ”
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we licked some of that dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health and 58 percent of respondents said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid.
The family of socially needed before eviction destroyed the municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of socially needed people left £50,000 of damage to their community home after being charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from home, the apartment cooperative officials were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, floor coverings were torn, garbage was lying all over the floor, and the walls were scribbled.
The family has already moved and is believed to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, head of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about whether she was going to save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property is likely to become known as the "not so nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple had three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and the police said that the terror that the family had been working included street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, distribution of drugs, and loud screams, quarrels and swears.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease contract, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, stinking garbage was found.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, the floor coverings were torn out
Neighbors say they were seen fighting on the street, and people called the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after receiving an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said: “They didn’t care about anyone at all. ”
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times have we seen the police here, you can't count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor in Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood, said that the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, police were regularly summoned to the house
Garbage and old toys lay around in an overgrown part of the village house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant was unable to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for her family’s behavior. eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complex case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors, and at the same time it will convey the message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenants' sons who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
A polluted mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
The workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that have been dumped around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth after eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they're going to try to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease agreements.
Angela Crowe of Denov and Cornwall Police said that eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after a low flight of a military jet plane over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Portuguese Aveir were terrified to death
The aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew incredibly low
The military air force said it was a training flight, and insisted that there was no safety threat.
The moment a low-flying jet descended over a crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic shots show how a military plane reaches almost a touch of the suns on a sandy beach near Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The tourists began to rise after they were disturbed by the noise of jet aircraft engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers, who posted video recordings of a dramatic overflight on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice really low, and at one point it seemed to crash. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed, and I really thought a plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force today declared that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight in order to identify a fishing ship off the coast and had to endure low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the air force insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four lives on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boat as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half the funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, the funeral services most often do not inform the survivors of their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
ČOI imposed 41 fines for this total of 73,000 crowns.
Jiří Fröhlich informed her spokesperson about this today.
Inspectors found fault with 47 out of 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This was about urns, candles and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"Since there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the audit action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl, who joined IS, was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Prosecutor Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned about her death in the Syrian Raccaa a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that it was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Raka, which is a bastion group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You want to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that it will discourage people from ever making a decision," said Akunjee.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then boarded a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she married an IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she was widowed.
Reid says if Clinton gets elected, she'll leave Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
The Senate leader for the Democratic Party Harry Reid says she believes that the candidate for the presidential election for the Democrats Hillary Clinton nominates Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the late Supreme Court judge will be elected future president.
Reid declared during a conference call on Thursday that she thought Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid’s spokesman later stated that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was merely speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "turn the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is president of the federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that Republicans who block Garland's appointment are "counselers" and "counsel" Republican candidate for Donald Trump's presidency.
He said Trump wasn't good for office.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars are for "women and men"
The magazine Treats works closely with photographer David Bellemer for the 2017 calendar, inspired by the calendar Pirelli from the 1970s.
But instead of exposing well-known personalities, NU Muses is trying to find the next generation of top models for its 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old-school Playboy, because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We must return to depicting timeless and classic nudity, when women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of a woman's body," Shaw said in a press release for the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who actually buys gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by middle-aged lonely men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comment section with perky notes under the pseudonym Not All Lonely MenIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, so many discussed resurrections of gramophone records are linked not to the boom of milliennials who want to enjoy the originality of ownership of a physical object, but to middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about massaging an enthusiastic fan - it all has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog had been broadcast as a TV story, I would have been watched by a camera heading out to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesticulating widely. Then I would have stopped, pulled out my hands and said something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look.
While Soho's charm and charm slowly fades from the heart - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, outfits and office supplies - several fantastic specialized shops with record records still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), a native from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and is looking at shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got, like, 3,000 or 4,000 recordings.
All those tapes line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he e-mailed me the picture, I didn't follow it home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also due to the fact that they can afford it: they can now buy gramophone records that they couldn't afford when they were originally released, and they buy again what they sold when they were young and they didn't have a penny.
"Many of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small and couldn't get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are likely introverts who like the company of themselves, adding: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new tide of people affected by the media wave, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old record records back.
According to my interviews, most of the people were getting rid of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record records and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy their record records back," he says.
This could explain the boom of record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone records?
It will not take more than a few seconds for you to find out in a store like Phonica that you will find a pleasant association of people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the system of contactless payments.
In the digital world, some gramophone enthusiasts may feel overwhelmed and have decided on the familiar environment of record album wrappers, things that bring back memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling in the gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, I'm a collector, and I think a lot of people are, too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers!” says a coworker from a pile of record records.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of the interviewed gramophones are never used, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records do not have gramophones.
At this point in the story, he probably seemed really concerned about going through a pile of compilatory bossa nova.
The aspect of "trophies" and the revival of interest is something Jonny noticed (42) who works at the Sounds of the Universe.
"Somebody recently came in and said, "I don't have a record yet, but I want to buy it on the Radiohead board so we can display it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of such ones is not large, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than the music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are younger people, not the older ones, the grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost one whole floor is currently reserved for record records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There's a couple of 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops before - instead of pulling jazz, the latest Wild Beasts pop, full of synthesizers and sex, is good to see different customers.
None of them seem to be particularly lonely, but you can't tell a pervasive mental trauma if you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) passes for a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various record records on sale.
She's one of those people who's more interested in looking at the windows than spending a lot of money.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so there's no way she collects record records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone records have their charms...
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that allegedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and I watch a group of teenage girls gathered around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
On the left is the staircase, whose wall is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's gramophone records: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of record records.
No one is looking at them - perhaps precisely because they are only for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's a purely "vinyl trick".
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area where there is more likely time and money than in other areas is also the one where it spends the most on the most luxurious goods that vinyl is.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov appear to be accurate - at least in record stores, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and lovers of vinyl who actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he's not spending Thursday morning wandering around the record store on Berwick Street, going through recordings and avoiding the strange, 30-year-old fake TV host who hides behind the back of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video reportage
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and is five metres long
The court in France refused to tear down shops in the jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea at temporary restaurants for 50 cents or basic meals for several euros.
The Prefect’s Office in Calais argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-supported associations and other groups do not provide food supplements for increasing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Controversial makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal basis to prevent people from doing 72 makeshift business, but that the objections of Prefect Calais were ‘understanding’.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than simply serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the camp café, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a nonprofit organization, offering 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people signed a petition to protect the "child" café.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of them only 8 years old. ”
On Friday, the charitable organizations Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the numbers of refugees in the camp increased to over 9,000 during the summer - which is the most in the whole time.
He thought he was dead.
Ulch raises himself and Volleyball Ústí.
"Since March I could train normally," he reported for the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then a heart condition.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when the weather's working or changing.
But nothing that would limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
Last year at the Summer Tournament in Woodens, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move anymore.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was a completely different story, and I was completely wiped out for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden House, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How'd you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some blood issues, I have to watch myself more when I go somewhere.
But there's everything you can do about it.
Only when I wanted to return to the Příbrami preparation last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock, physically, I'm better off than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I look forward to it, the crew looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about two more strangers coming.
I hope we sit down humanely so we can fit together.
Will you pick up the mouth?
It had a reputation for beating, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now it's second.
There's a new team in Ústí, only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extra league, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
Once we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see who gets beat up after the first rounds, we won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's experienced and he's been through a lot, he'll think of a better place than last.
But my coming here wasn't related to him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one and it was agreed that he would work here.
I'm not gonna say a name.
In the end, Mr Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to play, and I like to get an opportunity on a not-so-high team.
I've been in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's already training Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And we've had a few conversations there, sometimes we've been sitting together in the evenings after the games, so we've known each other friendly.
We beat them at 3:1, I immediately gave it to him at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He's got a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are still arriving.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting with an American, he seems like a nice guy, Brazilian, who knows how he'll speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm the tape recorder, that's who makes it, so I should be communicating with everyone.
I immediately found out who the players were, I looked up on the Internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the guy jumps, he's tall.
We posted a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'd fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to being the number one record player?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm 24 years old and I don't have the personality to take turns.
I'd rather be at the center of things, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play any more if I were to be the second record player and do it in full time. When something doesn't get done, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Six months in Pribram, when Kust couldn't do it as captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, whose offspring I was, I changed the number one and the number two.
An excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had many offers and just chose Příbram.
That's where Budejovice wanted me, and I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short location box remains the Phelps domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," laughed Phelps, while his eyes were full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother once again exulted in the audience, son Boomer slept peacefully this time with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming competitively, and in a few hours, it'll all be over, he said touched.
In the finale behind Phelps, nearly two seconds later, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long positioning range.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete who mastered the same discipline on four games in a row.
For most of the race, another American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira were led by Phelps.
While the defender of the gold in the final Kraulařská 50 put on a crushing finish, they fell off the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the positioning position, he advanced to the finals of the race to 100 meters of butterfly.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the signing double - after 100 won both in Rio and twice the track.
In the final, he left behind 37 hundredths of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, and the third was the Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy only has a fifth place in the 200th World Cup last year, he became signmaster king in Rio.
Larkin was removed from the imaginary throne, with the same double at last year's World Championship.
But he only won a medal at the Olympics now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiaka and American Simone Manuel shared the gold on the 100th crawfish.
For 16-year-old Oleksiac, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuel's second silver medal from the relay.
She won swimming gold at OH as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, said touched Manuel.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-meter butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from a 250-pound crayon.
Until sixth, the world record woman, Australian Cate Campbell, finished.
Japanese female Rie Kanet won the 200 breast trade, for whom it is the first Olympic medal in 27 years.
It has no valuable metal or from the World Cup, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia by Julija Jefimov, who, despite her doping history, is struggling with the hostility of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should answer those questions all the time.
I'm so tired of it, she said Russian swimmer.
The right to launch in Rio was acquired only at the special panel of sport arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them turn to the arbitration court, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was less than an hour before the match that they learned who they were going to fight.
They must have mastered tactical training.
And then, in an unusual time, the game started on small court number one.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the lead of the opponents, but in the condition of 19:19 they did not manage the end.
In the second they were clearly better and straightened out, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
Above all, a number of botched services meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russian," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the game?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start, before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, I lost my income, which I had gotten used to before.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
In the next set we boarded them with an overview on the field, a different defense and pushed on the service.
There's been a terrible mess in the tie break, and that's where we went down this side.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
It's too bad we missed the start of the first set.
We were able to download it, but we were missing the spikes.
The second set was great, and in the third, he decided to serve.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about the five that we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in small yard number one?
Sluková: Similar to China in the secondary courtyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one hour at night, total silence, music was not playing, nothing.
That was different from downtown.
We wouldn't have chosen such conditions, but we can't choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the contestants an hour before the match?
- She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like the other teams.
But Simon (Team Nausch) prepared a tactic for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of papers prepared with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
- I don't think so.
We played at 10:30, but not 12.
The Russian Birlov block in the pre-round playoffs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug at the pre-round playoffs at the OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in a group of ten, we had the mode shifted earlier.
That was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to perform their best at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've prepared ourselves as best we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not really typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process from the group was our goal, so on the one hand it's okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I will sleep it off and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother's here, here comes the first peeping SIM.
You can't escape it.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase SIM from one of the local operators when staying in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or marry there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunication Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The sales plan for SIM intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The authorities intend to implement new measures to enable their location to be monitored within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security that will enable foreigners to deal with criminal activity.
The so-called tourist SIM is also intended to help detect persons who exceed the permitted length of stay.
Special SIMs for foreigners should appear at the side of the SIM intended exclusively for Thais within six months.
The difference will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently switched on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function is not for Thais, because we can always follow them easily," added Tantasith.
It must be added that in Thailand prepaids are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller shall require an identity document.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators handed out free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
They were so completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also considered by ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not require foreigners to purchase a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can of course use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
After crossing the border, that is to say, after signing up to their network, the operators of that country know only relevant network information.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference between roaming prices and the rates of local operators is so vast that most tourists start looking for local SIM during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand have legally received immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in connection with privacy protection, compares the forthcoming system to the requirement of providing a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, if necessary, the police will need a court order to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be subject to an unspecified penalty.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a particular number will not be recycled until after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not log on to the network, the number could be renewed after 15 days in case of leaving Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property will be taken care of by the manager.
The condition was enough parking space and elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking floors, high energy intensity and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visitors can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga studio.
Why did you approach them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if it designs the apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to match the interior accordingly based on the client's wishes.
We already cooperated with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-residential space with adequate facilities for a four-member family conceived as a modern but not cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of the execution had to be monitored.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final appearance of the interior?
We approved all designs including technical drawings and material samples, however, the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from design and showed some interior elements that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think our collection of mostly Czech authors including Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund helped the architect to navigate our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the architect's idea, as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art etc.We then verified whether everything is in tune together using visualizations.
Were there any complications in the implementation of which you had to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, agree to a new one?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was possible to ascend to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we had planned were actually shielding the surrounding buildings.
That's when we literally changed the layout overnight.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the paneling of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, such as the upholstery of the dining and bar chairs of the Arper Standard.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes, or is there something you'd like to have differently today?
I believe it is a modern air interior, which primarily serves its purpose.
We are not planning changes, most of the modifications after moving took place in the plane of shading and settling terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, where the walnut wood appears to be too delicate for a house with a dog.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, the author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, therefore it was possible to make completely new layout and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior is an important element of placing sun tunnels in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight in the darker spaces of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the rooftop terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you're not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are native to Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've been moving around a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon, and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which helped me to get a job in a magazine.
Then why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel suffocated in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was so negative.
The people of France are negatively tuned in general, but it's gotten worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
In fact, some people evaluate the Czech nature in this way.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France, because they do not feel that way as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big issue.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I was Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job, basically, anywhere else, and I ran into an opening at Air France here in Prague.
I'll admit I didn't know Prague at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what happened in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or abuses, but I feel like people are more free.
That I could do anything, dress in any way, and no one would judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable with people looking at you, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
I don't think the Prague people care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
After that, my friend and I set up a website where people are offering and looking for shared housing.
So far, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half Czechs, and two other friends of Czechs.
I must say that the other specificity of Czechs is that at first they keep more distance.
They won't let anyone near their body.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on their cheeks.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You said you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is easy enough in Prague because everyone here speaks English.
Even in curfews or food.
I'd like to learn English, but I don't have that kind of time.
And because everyone can communicate in English at least a little bit, I don't need to learn the language that quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Pretty much not.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
I can think of one experience.
My manager, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone would have a problem with me being Muslim, that's never happened to me before.
Even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown and be called names.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the present situation affect you?
Are you afraid, for example, that something similar to that in Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I could not imagine something like this happening in France.
And it's not just about the Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognise violence at all.
To me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill, because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists covering for yourself with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow those reports of violence, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met in the square of Jiří from Podebrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims together with Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But the way I see it, these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my coworkers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, they learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with a woman's subordinate position.
How do you feel about that?
There's no way I'm being subordinate.
It's more the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear a head covering.
Like a hijab?
And the way I was brought up is the most important thing about it.
For example, my mother is a true Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is purely personal.
It all depends on how she interprets it.
When a person reads the Koran, he should make his own opinion of those things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran saying that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves require it, I will take it.
Do you plan to stay in Prague?
For now, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own kids here.
I think Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims together with Christians demonstrated against violence.
Sailor Kozelska Fencl's wind in Rio hit the forward rungs.
Friday's trips at sea in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were published by the Czech sailor Veronika Kozelské Fenclová.
In Laser Radial class she moved to 10th place before the final two races.
This would ensure that the Czechs participate in the final race.
You collect the packages like pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea to use already planned routes for shipments is based on television director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea of inhaling life three applications with different geographical range.
The national app I'm transferring started in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities in it, and we're going to expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, before we focus more on foreign countries, says in an interview for iDNES.cz 41-year-old manager.
How do I move the app works and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and details of how much package you can transport and how much you want.
Maybe someone's asking for a transfer on that day.
When the route and time of delivery are in order, it is paired together and they both get mutual notification.
That's when the cabin opens, where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find their courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't guess how many registered and how many routes it takes to cover the optimal and each offer paired with demand.
It's already working on the main moves, and it's logically easier than on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
So far, people are building trust and finding that no one can escape with a package.
You haven't had to solve a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have after two months of launch?
At the moment, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people who make the roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that more will be being packed.
Is there any chance that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be a competition for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing the same day and at a fraction of the price.
You'll pay several thousand for delivery to a large company within two hours.
You'll pay a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing it.
Should traditional carriers be afraid of the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, there are huge multinational carriers feeding here, as well as trade chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually discovered that quality is not what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox with a note to pick up the package at the office, first the day after 7:00.
By then, I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't piss anyone off and send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
None of them have ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as manager of the music club, Matěj Liška as television director.
In 2014, they started to prepare the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned travel between world metropolises, especially aircraft, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The application Transport started to develop in December last year and released this May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to do all these applications, which one day will merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Don't you worry about working in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the border of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, but it's a different product.
It's clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we'll be another thorn in the eye through the gray economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to bypass the tax authorities and tax controls.
Each user, whether on the one hand or on the other, will be encouraged to tax his or her income if he or she makes it his or her income.
What makes you think the ministry has so much potential?
The shipper saves and the ferryman earns or reduces the cost of the trip.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In a time of social networking that divides people, we would like to see this one converge.
There may be nice stories, people are happy to help and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have been lacking a personal approach for some time now, and we say that this app is a service to people.
Then how do you guarantee that the courier doesn't escape with the package?
Each application user, together with the registration, scans the identity card and gives a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give both service and man credibility.
The couriers also collect stars on the basis of the sender's evaluation.
We offer insurance, we match the details.
A courier is liable for an uninsured shipment in the event of loss or damage, but he does not assume responsibility for content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hash in a sealed package in his trunk, the criminal liability will be charged to the sender.
Is there a risk of abuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, a traceable administrative body, which will be the only one to have a look at it, nor are we ourselves able to see them, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender shall be charged several percent extra for facilitating contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push on volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plato of eggs, and big as a bass of beer.
After that, there is no further restriction, and if anyone has room in the car, they can transport the fridge.
Plus, the sender has the opportunity to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what's required of him.
You don't even have to pack if you don't want to hide the contents.
You stick a forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, when I didn't pay much attention.
Then he showed me a demo app with transnational reach, which mainly targets passengers by plane.
At that moment, I told him I wouldn't look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year it took us to develop before we founded Shippansee LTD in London because of the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to get the app done, because it had birth pains and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback and we are not dealing with the foreign market so much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we're not in a hurry, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were sort of upgrades.
I'll transfer it when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application Mesíkem is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address and to the other side of the world.
It works for the sender as well as I'll transfer, but the difference is that as a courier, you see the shipments in the form of the points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your phone.
An application for couriers who want to do this for a living, we called Mesek Profi.
So someone can make a real profit by picking up packages all over town?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to earn their way to work.
Now that everyone's messing around with the pokémon, they can pick this up exactly the same way.
One can see where there are contracts around the city, come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and transported.
It's set cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be crucial for mailing companies to fill in data about them on the website, thus creating points on the map.
We are then able to invoice their use of the service every month.
Do you now devote yourself to the project full-time?
It's exhausting, but it's normal for us to work so that we can support and develop the project.
There is not a strong multinational investor hiding behind us, we are two boys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other suggestions and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage with us not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story section of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten diversity.
This will fix the second episode and the solo game in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of the network struggle in the first part.
Therefore, it is possible to look forward to freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using a combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused precisely on the skillful movement.
They'll look like platformers and include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, running on walls and rope slides are essential to overcome them.
In addition, it will sometimes be necessary to eliminate enemies.
Not even maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts will be missing.
In one case, it will be possible to lift up platforms and close massive doors.
You will adjust the form of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between fierce action and calmer moments to explore an unknown planet.
We're gonna play for Jack Cooper's pawn, dreaming about his career as a pilot.
Cooper, at the start of the campaign, along with Captain Lastimos, will be shipwrecked on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilderness will not be lenient to him either.
In addition, Lastimosa will suffer fatal wounds in the crash, which is why Cooper will be tasked with putting the captain's titan into operation.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's calls to the titan will also be significant.
It will serve players as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time robot depersonalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium is dry, it lists all the injuries that Cooper is facing in the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 came from the Polygon server.
In addition, it will be possible to judge the result in two months' time and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions of the network game after Gamesco.
Titanfall 2 comes out on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ label in 2013, she acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
Nordic, for example, issued Darksiders 2 Death Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 other games are created for the label and 13 of them have not yet been discovered by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a 20 - year - old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she used to date guys like that before me.
She's totally into him.
On those first days, her voice even changed, she had this girl's, love's voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching the whole thing.
He was a regular at 3:30 at the time, so she always went shopping at 3.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined I'd catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, make that decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife was controlling me mentally.
I think she soon found out that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted me to do.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a pussy.
At the time, my neighbors told me that they knew about it.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all popped up, it'd be bad.
The only thing in the family who knew about it was the daughter.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to see if there was anything I needed help with at the laundry.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got an anonymous call, that he was seeing my wife, and that everything was indicative of it.
I asked him what he'd say.
He was standing there, shrug his shoulders, looking down, and he didn't say a word.
Then, too, at that time, I met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never been anywhere much, who's having trouble meeting someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I wasn't even thinking about getting a divorce.
I was still counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this, and life would go on.
That's not what happened.
And I've basically never dealt with it all.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her a lot, but in the end, I gave it up for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
She's just more of a housewife than my wife.
At home, she always did everything - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's hardworking.
I always thought she was trying to keep me from complaining.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to pet her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that he still loves him. He's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
Even when it started and I was carrying it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live, and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree to it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it, and then she said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who undermine public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where the preachers often come with jihadic shots with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already then, it should have contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, internal contradictions struck her, and it never worked properly.
"It is a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation will probably be headed by former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a proponent of the secular state.
In France there are about 2500 mosques and mosques, some 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clergymen from the country and are considering this step for several other tens.
This week, the German police also intervened against jihadist clergymen.
The Imam allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate about a new institution was on fire in France to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will receive funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal foods, namely meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid in practice by sellers of halal meals for granting a permit.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Each year, about 30,000 of them leave France for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have been through educational programs at their universities should operate in French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have closed twenty since December and more will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at a shopping mall in Zaragoza, Spain, writes the Independent daily.
The shooting occurred after the wife and daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an unharmed daughter, an ambulance had to come for the men in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11.00 in the central part of the capital of the autonomous area of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, Independent writes that the motive was probably the unsolved recent divorce of both partners.
Asparagus rolls, wakame algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes light, well-eaten meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our appetites and our heads.
And so the summer gardens smell like grilled necks, briskets, pork pegs.
Nothing very healthy, nothing very light, sometimes with the exception of salad or toasted vegetables.
True, barbecue is economical for time and dishes, plus it's a social thing and no one has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to making good delicacies, which special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to boil, bake, fry or choke anything.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-adapted griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and food a real exotic delicacy.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
In fact, the time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is falling away.
The paper can only be softened into water for a moment and then it depends only on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
It's not an eyelash like an eyelash.
The advantage of many Asian dishes today is that raw materials are usually available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, which mixes several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
It is sufficient to buy a bag of appropriate size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, which promotes digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used especially in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within various festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America, as well as as as a "tool" for preparing various baked, cooked and fried foods that are packed in them in a similar way to the foil.
The banana leaf will then pass on a specific flavor to the food.
They can be bought in our shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, select only leaves richly green and thus healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, the preparation of wakame, sesame, and sesame oil salad is easy.
You can buy that one back frozen.
He who often eats or prepares sushi will probably know especially the nori algae.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves – that is, plates designed for making sushi.
Wakame – a dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaido – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as nori algae.
By the way, if you didn't know miso wakame soup, Asian women reportedly used it from the very beginning to recover after birth.
And at all, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
Cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents gray hair and is literally charged with minerals.
Dried and broken wakame also serves as spices, for example, to season rice.
Fresh algae are first let to leach in the water, then flushed, placed in boiling water and cooked for half a minute.
After that, it cools down in ice water, cuts out the middle rib and further adjusts, like a favorite salad.
Of course, buying it already finished, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all that's left is to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bomb of longevity.
If you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, easy and summery.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g cucumber, 60 g wakame algae and 60 g sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of Sriracha chili sauce, 20 g mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little bit of pine nuts.
Let's get the rolls ready first.
We'll dip rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to get soft.
In the meantime, in hot water, we'll cook asparagus sprouts briefly, put them in ice water quickly after about three minutes, so they don't lose color.
We put vegetable filling on the paper and pack it.
We prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and paste on rice paper.
Place asparagus sprouts on the banana leaf, add rolls and finish the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, mango slice, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven rugby, Fiji's choice takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in a seven-year rugby ended with a devastating lead on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated the British in the final game on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at 43:7.
The Fijians showed a masterful lesson in processing, landfill, evasiveness, support game, line run and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unspoken consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - the third for Britain on a given day - and the British could have been proud of their achievements in the 7th Rugby inauguration tournament, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard-earned win over the South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals the same day, may have made them sick in the finals.
But Fiji, in its form, would defeat a 15-man team in full health.
It may not be comforting for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, the Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
They've lost one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, British penetrations reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates it was like running behind a series of buses in motion and world cup champions led 5:0 when Oseo Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The clock showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakaraw and stop him from scoring for the third time, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added more after returning and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated the tedious Brits and came to the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29:0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for Rugby 7s while the British were still learning how to pass.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes after halftime, and the Fijians stopped... for four full minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interlude of Fiji Josua Tuisova passed on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise an 36:7. But the match had long since been won by the people of the Pacific Islands and their fans at the halls sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyous attitude of the Fijians.
At the final moments, Mata Viliam sweetened another attempt to win the Fijians.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely down.
Before that same day Fiji beat Japan 20:5 in the semifinals and the United Kingdom conquered South Africa in the close semifinals - by the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the lead at the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke the line of defense and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, Brother Anthony of the fifteenth team of England, secured a victory - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race inspired the fight of a coach with cancer
You won't find any more emotional gold on these Games, and that's something to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punishing exhales into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning at their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although two were sitting in the boat, there were three voices in the boat. When the boat shriveled on the surface to meet the second Olympic gold behind it in the race of the female pair, there was still a voice in the boat of Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying down the water surface with the elegance of the swan - does not reflect the nature of victory entirely.
Behind each gold rowing medal is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which piece by piece means the difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I had a bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I had this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's gonna change your perspective.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
The luck for the whole trio was that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, and thus reduce the blackout to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get myself together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory were their first thoughts of Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own unrest.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who had completed a mission in Afghanistan, said: “This week I was at the bottom with emotions, maybe it’s a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it emphasizes how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so did Robin.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better man for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose a single race in five years.
The couple set off a staggering rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused at the moment, at the most.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something amazing.
We weren't looking forward to fireworks today, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to decide what's next.
Glover's getting married next week, her bride-to-be is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months for them to know that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling about this," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let him drive people for free, says the hunter of taximafie Rubeš to a breaking charge.
Six taxi drivers and a former official of the City Hall in Prague are, as CT said, defendants.
You've made a series of reports in which you've uncovered fraudulent practices and those that are supposed to be in a group that's going to be court-martialed.
You've been facing some unpleasant clashes with exposed actors about this.
How much is it to you that the report on the prosecution of members of the organized group is a turning point?
I thought there might be a trial.
I'm curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by carrying all people for free.
That's a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not see any punishment effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one is a pingle, another is a pizza delivery, and one is completely out of it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a prison problem.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
People like that should bring back the companies that took her.
For a quarter of a century, they did what they did to destroy our country’s name and to steal from its people.
Well, let's get them doing a good business card and delivering people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to pick up garbage, they get a car, and they take people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get probation eventually, and they're not gonna care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
They belong to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the website in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, he is now preparing the Prague Guide, which is primarily intended for foreign viewers.
Rubeš advises in the form of short reports which services he prefers to avoid in Prague and which he recommends to use without fear.
Previously filmed series with titles How to do it, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the prosecution, they're referred to as organized groups.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent cabbies be described as mobsters?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Godfather.
They're more like mobsters - juniors, but they're definitely organized.
All they do is watch each other's relays.
Prague is completely fragmented.
I observed that, for example, the main station does not like Parisian, Parisian does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlsbad (disco club)
Everyone's just keeping an eye on their little place, and every group is organized somehow.
It's probably a complicated network.
The defendants are, however, only seven people, six cabbies, and one former Magistrate officer who warned the driver about checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon did not disappear from the streets.
So, what percentage of Prague's taxi frauds are your estimates?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryyáček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - in his car he drives a telescopic baton, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and drives people.
Last time I drove with him, he asked me for $700 a mile.
For some reason, his police did not detain him.
Only a few people from the whole big group have been selected.
The same situation is also in other locations of Prague.
The indictment of seven people therefore makes it difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague badness, which is probably much larger in size.
Of course, it's no use.
It'll help, but all evil can't be eradicated, that's true.
Are taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists still performing in the same places you showed in the reports, that is, at Charles Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and break the decrees every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
It's not a cat anymore, it's a total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, though only a part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I thought of it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it's gonna be a little better, I'm gonna keep doing it.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get rid of him.
You can't settle for that.
But it's not like that, of course, there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test drives, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometers, although then he claimed that it was an amount of CZK 56 (used a decimal trick).
He had a receipt for it, the cops arrived, and this cab driver was so cutely rude, he was still seeing those cops, and he asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the meter taped the decimal point and robbed the tourists by 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the insolence of fraudulent cabbies did not give way even after you showed the faces of those who charged senseless sums for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
What happened to the cab driver reaching out to 56 crowns?
Cops sent him away, saying he couldn't be discussed with him on the spot because he put out a receipt.
And that's going to be a problem in that court, too (six cabbies and one ex-officer).
There'll be a cab driver on one side with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
But according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the Magistrate is not allowed to use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in a court of law.
When I was filming parts about their scams, the cabbies themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I'm the only one who's ever wanted to use the footage for the story.
Are you afraid that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope every judge understands that no cab driver could drive for six or ten kroner per kilometre, because he wouldn't make a living doing it.
You were talking about a decimal trick that underwater taxi drivers are moving in front of foreign clients.
Is this still up-to-date, or are they concerned about using this trick after publishing your reports?
I think we've popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was driving with a cab driver the other day, bragging about him being the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard glued from the side of the meter.
When I asked him what he had in there, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If the cabbies-chefs didn't work too well, can they be affected by a court of law with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You talk about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And they're fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
In my experience, I must say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague, fortunately, prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their service?
They have a taste, but they miss um.
He's not very good at it, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for a full-scale restriction coming from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they weren't protesting against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
Turns out they just blocked Prague, and it just turned out to be the best ad for Uber.
How do you evaluate the approach of the Prague Magistrate in solving the problem of overcharging fares?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The Magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole who was leaking information, which means that the taxi department had been doing its job for years for nothing.
I hope they charge the clerk with all the controls he's been scrambling to realize what he's done.
That's what's the worst about it.
I've even been with him on one of the checkpoints, which I only found out from their schedule.
It's been months since the last series was published.
What's the response?
I mean especially for foreign viewers than the series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them those videos.
And then when we walk down Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people that are seen in the footage are really standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
Seriously, though.
I'd put a rug around them so people would look at them.
The Communism Museum, right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need to?
Right.
I ride with services that I don't have to pay in cash, but by credit card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there's no chance of fraud.
But there are a lot of distractions that are fair.
I only took a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Wow, you've got some balls."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were mentioned in 2005.
In the same year, former Mayor Pavel Bém went on a control ride in disguise as an Italian tourist, and immediately at the first attempt, the driver cheated him out by 200.
But editor Rubeš had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for driving from Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which is about CZK 195 per kilometre, as the authors calculated the reports.
The Prague Magistrate set the maximum price at 28 CZK per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the film: for example, a two-mile journey from Pařížská to Truhlářská Street cost a tourist CZK 400.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
They also charge 600 crowns for the ride to Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers long.
Marble washes mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer the better.
The uncleanness is good, although sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be pulled out of the folds.
It's not easy, and it's not fast, the restorer Vanessa Trostová from Oldřichov in Hájy approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the tombstone is lined with scaffolding, on which you need to climb countless times and climb again.
"The restaurator should be careful, patient and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
In Frýdlant, this is far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the rear wing of Frýdlant Town Hall were restored, the statues of St. Mary Magdalena in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlant Okružní Street, Marian column in Frýdlant and atlanta in the façade of the spa in Nový Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of the headstone Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the deposits of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against the fall and shift; either they will anchor into the wall or to each other.
They are also expected to treat and preserve the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then the inscriptions on the marble plates will be gilded with fine slices of gold," said Věra Sobotová, State Monumental Care Officer at the City Authority in Frýdlant.
There's no history of a tombstone being repaired.
At a closer glance, the openings, drilled in marble columns, will take hold of the openings.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're remains of the tombstone decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish raid during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
They literally brushed the tombstone, remarked Saturday.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, restorers with a mild exaggeration are at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that were found under water, to restore the baptizer, wall paintings in the tomb, and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to set out in the future for the vitrage," said Saturday.
The church is in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128,000.
They will be paid out of subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the recovery.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the circuit round of the Historical City of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, specified the Mayor of Frýdlantu Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the winnings for the restoration of the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments on selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a one-month and a half-year horizon.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who'd have thought that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% correction in February, is now at a new historical maximum and has already credited 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
The iron rule is thus reaffirmed that traders should never, in the long run, oppose the interest of central banks, which have so far always achieved their goals.
In a situation where US shares are at a historical high, the volatility that is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown happily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the US central bank, and when, like today, the VIX has remained stable below the 12 percent threshold.
And so he wouldn't.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy £70 billion in bonds in the coming six months, has also taken a hand.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes already so low yields even lower and contributes to an almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is, of course, a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, and the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the commodity market situation and China is stabilizing and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US shares continue to survive in a similar quiet regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician to do this difficult job, said European Commission chief Juncker, when the French politician (really experienced, because he appointed the European Commission's chief negotiator with the conditions of leaving the EU of Great Britain.
Juncker's selection has blown away signs of hope that it is in the serious interest of the EU to seek out forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media have accepted the name Barnier as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As a Euro Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He took it as only he could have taken it: the stubborn enemy of Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The supporter of multilateral regulations was co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and he has been hating everything that comes from the London City Financial Center, pushing through legislation of excessively hard regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, tough, and probably a ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How not to remember in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which so much contributed the balance sheet, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
That is why today Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this way -.
It would be good for everyone!
An earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin's ruler released his loved Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from his post as president of the presidential office on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
She informed the Russian media about this with an appeal to the Kremlin's press service.
Putin hinted that Ivanova was being released at his own request.
At a meeting that was carried by Rossija 24, the president said he was following Ivanov's wishes when he took office, that he wanted to be president of the presidential office for no more than four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the President's administration, now led by Ivanov's current representative Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is referred to as one of Putin’s closest associates.
In the past, for example, this former KGB officer held positions as Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the seat of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, however, stated in his meeting with Putin that he was actually a recordkeeper at the top of the administration.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced.
Even uncle and shafara won't play the finals.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches has been able to turn into a final turnout.
Petra Kvitová, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig, lost her first fight after the 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6 sets.
After a while, Kvitová was followed by Czech deblists Šafářiová and Uncle.
While the Williams sisters’ slayers were reaching for the win in the first set, they lost two sets of sets, and the Russians eventually captured the set in the short game.
The second set then lost a ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: Skifare Ondřej Synek won his semifinals with an overview, when he beat the second Damir Martin from Croatia by almost a second in the end.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, he said.
It was his opponents, unlike him, who had to fight for progress.
So they've lost some strength, which could make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the oar of Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in Snyko's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower took the fourth position in today's semifinals, and on Saturday she will have a start in B finals and a fight for 7th to 12th place.
The gold from London won't defend it that way.
I didn't make it to the finals at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I ran a good race, and I put everything I could into it.
The contestants were just better, Topink Knapka bowed before them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would make it to her fourth games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could make it out of that field.
I was surprised the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the finals through Austrian.
Unfortunately, there was a life race today, said the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio was the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed to get out of the qualification for the second time, this time the small marks in the lie.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
Qualification was best done by the Russians.
From the first rung advanced Sergei Kamensky with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628,9).
Nepocholy's attack was worth 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes also spoke to the program in Rio, including Czech seven-bodies Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová belongs eleventh place after the second Olympic competition, Czech recordwoman Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
Leads British Katarina Johnson-Thomson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both took care of historically the best height performance within the seven-gauge.
They were still trying to jump 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of such questions: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In the 20th century, dictators occurred in both great Eurosian nations, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism, as reported by the Black Paper of Communism, whether they were daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent war leadership, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanely wiped out about 6 million Jews, and the total sacrifice of World War II is estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, atrocities were carried out by Germans and Soviets.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were to blame, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes actively, passively or merely by cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specificities of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the immediately ending of the war came denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you do that!
This brought true reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, German elites have mainly cared about the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to reconnect Alsace-Lotrinia or anyone - to attack the revanš - in a military way - everyone will recognize that.
After losing the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often a criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Russia's putinovian policy is to revansh, conquer lost territories, humiliate the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of your own people are no value to a veracity.
Fight your battles, and strangers will fear.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from growing tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimean region has deteriorated.
Who benefit from the growth of tension?
After a longer period of relative calm, the relations between Ukraine and Russia have again deteriorated.
The pretext of the Ukrainian party became the peninsula of Crimea, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both hostile parties contradict each other and it is difficult to verify them independently, so we can only think about the old familiar question who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian party, which Ukraine, of course, rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
A well-known response to the arrest of Ukrainian special forces in Russia has already come from the case of pilot Savchenko that they were reportedly abducted in Russia.
If we agreed to the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further acknowledgment of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, in the wake of the immigration crisis in Europe, attention has been drawn away from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s leadership has already lost credit to its citizens, with current support for President Poroshenko around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have been bankrupt long ago if it had not been for generous financial injections by the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime once again urgently needs to draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to show up again as strong men who are not afraid to face the great Russia.
All we can hope for is that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but all the ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria showed inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the journeys of these consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7 %), transport (1.8 %), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3 %).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2 %), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5 %), health (0.1 %).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The U.S. Secret Service reportedly watched the hacker attacks of the Russians for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks was made public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the party headquarters servers.
But no official report mentions Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied the part of the attack.
The report of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because it would reveal that American secret services are monitoring the attack and could be exposed as well as the way they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Council
The material on tracking the Russian footprint was encrypted, and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight Congressional leaders, called the US gang of eight, were informed of public officials.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, chairmen of the Democrats in both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congressional Defence and Security Committees.
On Thursday, the acting head of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile announced that she was setting up an advisory board for cyber security to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Alberto.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer's initiative on health problems after eating food Salmon smoked - pieces 100 g, consumption date 22.11.2016 Prague health care professional carried out a check at stores Albert on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that the lot L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for man - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and man-ingested live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Sticha.
Our customers are very sorry for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the lot from sale and for preventive reasons we withdrew all other lots of this item.
Mistakes took place on the side of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, told the New Speakers of Albert Barbora Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the stores of the chain and get the money back.
The larvae destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vráta.
The health authorities informed the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration of the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to the server safety of the food.cz people after ingestion of the parasite can become ill by anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, says ČTK.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after consumption of poorly heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of larvae disease, they usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either under sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or during freezing.
Veteriners have currently checked the salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expeded, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, was a 919 package to date.
Currently, the unsold stock is being withdrawn from stores, said spokesperson Petr Pejchal on Friday of the Czech News Agency.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman tried to flee from Rakka, probably killed by a Russian air raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage with the jihadist, who was soon killed, sobered up.
The expected paradise of caliphate turned for British girls into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She made repeated calls to Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They've been ordered to shoot without thinking about it, quoting The Telegraph as the lawyer of the deceased girl's family Tasnim Akunjee.
The last trace led to Rakka, where the girl made the last call.
Then there was only a report of her death, which could not be verified.
Her family was communicating with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they hoped to meet their former student again.
However, Kadiza was likely killed before she could escape because the house in which she stayed leveled the air strike in May reported the British ITV News.
Television added that the bomb apparently dropped a Russian plane that attacked the IS bastion in Syria.
You'd put up with blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, family lawyer.
In the week when she (Kadiza) was thinking about fleeing the territory of the Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape, and according to the information available, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she took it as a warning and decided not to take risks, according to the BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, together with 15-year-old friends from Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set out on the road on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to the territory controlled by IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadiz back.
You'd put up with blue from heaven just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, strained their strength to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing he thinks is that Kadiza's fate can serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, they realized how things were going there, they understood how far that differed from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they also paused, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the regional center and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held at the town hall and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts resided were pitiful and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
That's why city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it has not been in operation for a long time; it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as smaller repair facilities were costly for operation and did not pay much.
The stories of the convicts and the ghost hunt.
The prison opened up to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new building to see for themselves how different conditions existed in them.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment have been applied to criminals, whether it is to break fingers or burn marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be confined to one of the cells, mostly for a photograph in memory, or to develop a feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish locations where it is said to be haunted.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have gone out there, and to this day, the museum allows people to come hunting ghosts.
But such a night will cost 300 pounds, which is approximately 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of ways bordering on absurdity.
You can make yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that seems to come out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake shall be made public immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism of the accusation that the application promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered the users a filter this week that gave them sloping eyes, twisted teeth and puffy faces, some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated issues did not point to a greater problem for society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it and the news and indignation spread quickly and Snapchat said the next day that he cancelled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended to show accounts to the characters of animé, not as a caricature of Asians.
But the filter reminded the observers who witnessed racism of painful stereotypes in action.
The others flatly rejected comparisons with the cartoons.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in her e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is hard to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellow face, but that the yellow face is drawn to a disdainful extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural limits.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the meeting halls in the corporations to Holywood and the facilities that we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user,” said 25 - year - old Katie Zhuová on Thursday in an interview, “it is very difficult to go unnoticed today, as it was before.”
Katie Zhu, product manager and designer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and invited others to do the same.
In her article for Medium and on the phone, she said that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment of Snapchat workers.
Katie Zhu criticized the vast white, completely male leadership of society and the article ended with hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that they have no diversity and color people among employees at the moment when these matters are decided," said Zhuová, who has a Chinese-American origin, "or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak."
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees, with private company status.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on the underrepresented population and internal control of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: "I wonder if they really need other such users who can say that it is not okay," with their account being cancelled.
Army officers misrepresented intelligence about IS, says the parliamentary committee
In a report issued on Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee stated that officers from the central headquarters of the United States changed intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events of the country did.
According to the preliminary report of the working group drawn up by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on the Armed Forces, the Committee on the Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Defence, a “extensive dissatisfaction” was found among the analysts of the Central Intelligence, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the US efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report states: “The press releases approved by Centcom superior officers usually offered a more positive image of US counterterrorism efforts than confirmed by the facts on earth, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a misanalysis is presented to senior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, congressman and Republican from California.
The failure in Centcom's leadership goes to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing US efforts in training the Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decisive evidence is offered that the Obama administration’s leaders ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts felt that they were under pressure from the leaders of Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the Central Staff, statements and statements from the Congress were significantly more positive than what events were in reality," the report states.
For example, Centcom’s representative has publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said MP Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party from Kansas.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the top-ranking intelligence staff of the Central Staff of the USA manipulated the outputs of the intelligence services of the staff in order to bagate the danger of IS in Iraq.
Republicans set up a working group after learning about analysts’ concerns about the manipulation of intelligence information concerning the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by a more detailed examination.
There is yet another investigation conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence in Centcom's intelligence services.
Democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very narrow process for drawing up the evaluation of information about IS and the Iranian security forces," said representative Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the Committee and representative of Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “has led to a distortion of intelligence output,” he has damaged morality among analysts and has “inadequately taken into account dissenting opinions.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House is attempting to press Centcom's analysts to adjust their conclusions according to "the draft or the political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an ongoing investigation into the Pentagon's Inspector General, which was initiated after Centcom's analysts' complaints.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, Pentagon spokesman, said in his statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the parliamentary report because the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
However, he stated that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental questions of national security.”
The investigation has consequences beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now declaring a growing number of defense representatives).
However, last year's accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis locations.
The criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, when an intelligence analyst at Centcom, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements of the contrary, air strikes against the refineries of the Islamic State did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not transmitted outside the Central Staff.
Centcom's commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized for the past year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony to be too positive for the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The U.S. won field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be a decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam scored three goals in a match against Japan, which ended with a 6:1 victory, and just a day later, she scored the first two goals of the game for the American women's field hockey team, in which America beat India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a success worth remembering, but Bamová (27) said that she was not sure if she had ever succeeded in doing this.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who write down their goals.
But this is what he knows: Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4-0 and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will end up in the first and second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, the Americans have caused a commotion with their surprise ride here, four years after finishing between 12 teams at the London games.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey hockey stick for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older sisters twins played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make it to the final roster.
Then came 2012 when neither she nor members of her team were doing very well.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bamová said.
In London, we did not have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night Bam started in the first half by shooting the goal bekendem from nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team turned out surprisingly hard and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then clicked into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the americans in the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Zen trampolines in the middle of an Olympic rampage
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make it felt persistent, indescribable, and interested in the rotation of competition and effort.
It's like an Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay stake passed from a gunman to a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlon player.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or resentment between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming sweetheart of women with dimples in their faces, is in the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names will ring in the homes in prime time between advertising and sponsor spots if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
Olympic fire doesn't shine on all competitions the same way.
Away from the center, a bit in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting of air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always be successful in the classic swimming style, and he'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my special favorite, allow me to point out the inconspicuous charm of trampolines.
Although the jumps on the trampoline have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced to the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many of the people I asked about did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US has never won a medal in the trampoline jumps, and none of the athletes made it to the finals until 2012.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be embraced by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the jumps on the trampoline are still unlucky, partly because the ear of the uninitiated will seem more suitable for the clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a country-watching enthusiast.
It has a comical potential - comical vibrations of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampoline", meaning "jumpboard."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform assemblies with several elements (salta, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to the design, difficulty and “times in the air”.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual orbital trajectory is ahead.
Warriors for gold medals must go on, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They try to catch up not only with the finish tape or the starting wall, but, as TV news reports, with another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to lead the audience to tears.
But I think it's also rather exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
The jumps on the trampoline in this regard bring relief.
The athlete's track on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she is reflected, as if they were in a weightless state as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is not possible, but during the duration of the assembly there is no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no measuring distance, but only perfect, delicious time and gravity.
This is the closest thing to the Olympics and zen ever come close.
Qualification and final of women takes place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern time, male competitions then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC Station will broadcast the finals within the afternoon block, which starts both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook through the other battles.
And if attention is to be achieved only by male athletes being the subject of love views and materialization - as the US gymnasts recently suggested in Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to gasp.
"Protesting Generations" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have come across violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses claim that many protesters were shot during the clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government unrest has taken over the country, which has spread to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses claim that police officers have been shot and killed by an army of unarmed protesters.
Passing video recordings of protests, probably from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, capture security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, project leader Horn of Africa for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the region, particularly in Somalia, and a few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train running in the capital city of Addis Abeba.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights constantly talks about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
"If you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breach," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
There are many complaints, and they concern everything from land disputes to absolute control over the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, pressure is increasing on the border with Eritrea. A conflict along this inaccurately marked, the disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Allitarians fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oroma Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, now after years of smouldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have rekindled.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for up to the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become widely available and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as it normally does during protests, many people can still communicate via online proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered in protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between the Oromas and the Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhars are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, have excelled in politics and trade and exploited the Oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to a united leadership," said Mulat Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests occurred in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigrai ethnic group, which account for around 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to undisclosed diseases.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterful at exposing the initial signals of discontent and using ambassadors to process and win the opponents to his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled from relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigra region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be more blood spilling.
Last time Ethiopia experienced such riots in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts called elections that the government screwed up and then stole.
There was a hard hit, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in the past months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month protesters in the city of Gondar, Amhar, attacked business companies owned by Tigers, and resentment against the Tigers on social networks is becoming increasingly common.
Analysts say that protests put the US and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, although it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to bagate the latest controversy on Friday, flooding his campaign, saying that he didn't mean it when several times this week he insisted that Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his advocates in an awkward position, who have fought hard to defend him in a stormy time, and he must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
After this proposal at the meeting on Wednesday night Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the talks that he really did not intend to say that the President and H. Clinton created IS.
But in his Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of the claim of only one day old, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to ease Trump's remark by reminding him that Obama was trying to destroy IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at the moment that Trump attempted to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his preferences in election polls are falling.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel in Michigan this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
Again, on Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax increases, and he said that her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm to defend himself earlier.
At the end of July, when he reaped a wave of criticism, when he spoke with the suggestion that the Russians should penetrate Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comment by saying, "Of course, I am sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to temper them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some reports have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction he then “proclaimed an explanation,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that he is skillful in his statements, and he knows that they are vague enough to explain them differently.
As the results of the election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has in recent days chosen an even more lenient tone, rather than tempering things for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Tump was far away from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very closely behind her in Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid apologizing for provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But, along with Trump’s increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes put his loyal followers in an awkward position, who must stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when asked about Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a novice, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most common Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton was acting as Secretary of State, has allowed IS to flourish and not be able to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday’s gatherings in Pennsylvania Trump continued to rain fire on Twitter to the media for bridging and biasing his every word.
He laughed at “poor, pathetic” TV scholars who tried to understand him and said,“ They can’t do that! ”
Several democrats sneered at Trump's apology, saying it was just more proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
The café has been pushed out of the market by prices. Now it returns in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe café was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was pushed from the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the shop that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is ransacked, and Verb is now a soap shop. ”
But if New York is a change, then it's also re-discovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
New Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Also coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café, who is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the transfer to a new place, he said he'd be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even used the old Verbu lighting again.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
There are ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings, such as capers and fried onions.
You will also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original regulars.
"The line of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices," he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
It even occurred when the café moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbo," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day instead of her usual iced coffee she had mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been devoted to Verb since 2003.
You go before work and you order the same thing.
"I come here every day at quarter and eight, like clockwork, and they're already preparing my bagel with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he puts bacon, eggs and ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an additive.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also received the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it up soon to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the café to spread to the neighboring building.
Many customers are satisfied to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopened, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the times of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the presidency in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
The gourmet President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as the goose liver pâté and the Maryland Turtle Soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: eggs for the devilish way in tomato sauce, potato puree and for dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans to eat. ”
A couple who lives in Brooklyn Heights is devoted to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book "97 Orchard", tells the story of a living house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, A Square Meal, published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their own cooking solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, steep buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had a turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which according to the couple was excellent for talking about food during the crisis.
“The meatballs were very popular,” said Ms. Ziegelman.
It sold peanut, liver and bean burgers.
They were made from the ingredient and other cheap foods that the ingredient had set.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe smirked.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet, what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" watched the ways in which the nation was coping with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally feared: Mysterious food spread, such as meatballs and casserole dishes, casseroles as “a wonderful way to take advantage of the leftovers,” said Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unesthetic ingredients under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the central point of American food - has become a cost-effectively allocated luxury.
Strange blends that were supposed to serve as caloric and nutritional fillings had priority over flavor or even common sense in cooking.
During her book research, which contains recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period meal of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: “It was surreal. ”
Peanut butter and roasted onions don't mix.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the Shere of the Federal Bureau of Domestic Economy between 1923 and 1943 - controlled the eating habits of the country.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the reins of the budget, and slops, such as cream spaghetti and carrots, transformed into tasty foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, desserts were created in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose, "I'll have a pie."
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farming cuisine of his childhood, he was dining as the selected millionaire he had become.
"He likes to eat continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him set an example with his own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, which led to the fact that the White House was “not only served the most poutiest meal in all of Washington, but also in the most disgruntled way prepared.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis resolved as soon as the country was back on its feet.
The legacy remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
A couple say that while writing a book, they understood Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits better - like why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman remarked: “People were sick of it. ”
There's been an accident with wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It is called plum cream," said Ziegelman, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly put a spoon in thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as a proper householder, he said to his wife: “A little bit of meatloaf would be good for him. ”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who are rolling into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what shows would look like if we did them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
Using photoshops, they create collages that funnyly show what it would look like if famous TV shows and movies were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of expenses for legal representation in the case of a patent against hepatitis C against Merck Group
The district court judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal fees incurred by it in the process of patenting against hepatitis C against the manufacturer of medicines by Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment under which Gilead was to pay 200 million for damages due to the breach of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge had found out repeatedly against the law of Merck, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead was entitled to waive the charges incurred in connection with the case representation.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the next generation drug market against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of Gilead drugs.
American-supported military forces claim to have gained full control of Manbij
The US-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic State fled the city, said the group spokesperson on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the rest of the radical group that have been hiding in the city has left.
The troops liberated over 2,000 civilians who were detained by the radicals, told Reuters Sharfan Darwish from the SDF alliance and the Military Council of Manbijah.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it", said Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for democrats and her husband had an income of $10.75 million in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million in fees for lectures to the joint register, and the former Secretary of State admitted $3 million in income from Simon & Schuster for his book on his work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's co-candidacy, U.S. Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has published tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine remain a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
On this Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and receding from his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary that candidates for the President of the United States publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the US Treasury Department's audit as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's aide on Twitter and followed up on the democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, special advisor to Trump, told CNN on Thursday that he wouldn't allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audits were complete.
According to Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is making a strong appearance on the issue, and on Friday she released a video that reminds us of how high-ranking Republicans urge Trump to publish her tax returns.
On Thursday, they will mention the question in their speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said.
Politico said that Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim that this may be the case at the present time.
The federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton advocates a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett to ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet called Trump to meet and exchange tax returns at a Clinton convention in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway resides.
Buffett said that he also passed an IRS audit and that Trump was not "fearing" of the Financial Authority, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign released tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, their incomes are just $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
The conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
This process proved to be successful, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and train volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to protect their homes and crops in four steps without harming animals.
Many of them used a spear to defend themselves earlier.
Friday is the world elephant day dedicated to protecting these animals.
“Since they developed this... set of tools, we have noticed a change of behavior in these communities. People believe that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said the CEO of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light the light on the passing elephant and run the horn.
If it doesn't discourage him, he'll be throwing away the so-called "chile cloud".
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with a firecracker in a condom, its end is wrapped so that only the wick can see from it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder spreads into the air.
Usually just one whiff and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which triggers a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel on the "application" of Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after he found out that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have a code for calling Israel, according to the employee's word on the basis of the "demand" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of a documentary about the “Shoah” Holocaust, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of codes for calling at the hotel.
However, the state was not mentioned among countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, Germany’s capital, in 2016?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling Israel through its own call center.
The director looked for an explanation and with a problem he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, “shocked.”
The hotel employee replied that the measure was “decided after consideration of the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this move made the director even more angry.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's call code be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the staff in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the ambassador of Israel in Germany called Yakov Hadas-Handelsman the case “a great shame.”
We were appalled and shocked by the events.
It's a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong online reaction, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel is simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"A shame to you," says another post, which points out that the hotel, located on the noble street of Kurfurstendamm, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dropped any accusations by calling the event "overlooking" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
“Never a direct order has been issued” not to include Israel in the call code list, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung, a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash of students and police took place in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problem escalated when government order services tried to disperse the students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the governor of the state of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin in order to save money is also the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spraying signs against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the protestors took a mass drive to the streets to support the deposed President Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate in the country decided to prosecute her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryana, after the abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, sales turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year comparison.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were abolished, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same 2015 period and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $158 million.
The leap increase in trade ensured the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iran’s citizens.
In addition, Iran has for the first time reached the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians, and the ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner rushes home after the British win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in a male team sprint on a velodrome in Rio, when the VB trio defended the London 2012 title.
A 23 - year - old native from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man delighted the legend when he came to the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of a favored New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of a modest sixth at the world championship in track cycling in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for Jamie Staff's specialized opening racer.
So Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoy left, there was also a vacancy that he tried to fill in Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was a champion with Hoy four years ago - and with Skinner he achieved an Olympic record in qualifying, but the leotard took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his bike, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, when Hindes went on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his BBC commentator position, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes got on stage, he didn't take his eyes off them.
A 23 - year - old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best of myself and to honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals, and we beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
Later, he withdrew the note and Britain’s opponents had no opportunity to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “With all the British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London. ”
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we have five days of success on the velodrome.
With the form Kenny performed, it is unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
That would then for Kenny - who is exactly on a day 12 years younger than Hoy, also has the birthday of 23 March (this date seems sacred to the British sport, this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
Just like how much Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will be taking part in a sprint that starts today and lasts another three days.
A 28 - year - old Bolton native said: “Now I enjoy this one.
The team race is always the best.
You're winning along with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood title. ”
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain had more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in a four-kilometre fighter race.
They ended up with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) take place on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will definitely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when he was called on by the referees to measure height.
In a similar race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavie achieved a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on their strong team of track cycling and dominated the middle season of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations decreased during the preparations for Rio.
In the background, dramatic events unfolded, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the ending of a career of great men such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the Velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of a melting plant in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum melting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the melting plant to terminate the contract of supply of electricity.
This step is taking place after the government of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the granting of subsidies that keep the company running.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
There may be 2000 jobs at risk in Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closed.
And since the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other avalanches.
Alcoa closed Point Henry in 2014, which led to the closure of Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa plant in Portland is a waste and is in danger of being shut down.
This step follows years of speculation about the company’s future, initially in response to a strong Australian dollar, and recently due to plant production prices.
The AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, stated that it expected that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Aluminium, small business shares are held by Chinese company CITIC and Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue," she said.
In addition, the Commission notes that, in the absence of any comments from the Commission, the Commission considers that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017’, declared the power plant.
In addition, any possible impact on AGL’s profits since the fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of the contracts according to its books of $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract ‘has no impact on its ... ability to operate a melting plant or to secure the supply of electricity to a melting plant.’
The American company stated that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was to start to apply from November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
The head of operations of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would result in a substantial decrease in demand on the market [electrical energy].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real estate TV show - now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, mother-manager, appeared on the front page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the ambassador of Estee Lauder, who performed at a fashion week in Milan, Paris, and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page," Kendall wrote.
The cover-up was followed by bizarre (or simply continuation of the humoresque by Kardashian?) staged video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitly and along with them all favorite uncle from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sister's cover so that the scene could end in a classic turn: they're throwing a secret party.
It's an overplayed storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the show at 8:00 a.m.), but somehow Kris needed to make sure that the other girls could make a living in this publicity.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue, we've certainly entered the new Kardashian era.
The older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is another league.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist reckoned that of 832 pages in last year's edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
Uncovering the star that appears on the front page is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more "celebrits that make models" on the front page than "models that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and Ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the headline in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Laga Gaga.
But although it is highly unlikely that Kendall - described as a "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, nor to the stars of the real estate show, or to children today who know how to make a well-cut video (even if Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "whores of the moment".
These feelings have rekindled with news of Jenner appearing on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not appropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's showing off for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's make-up.
She and all her sisters are selling you self-images on their own paywalls.
She's selling photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare moments, he performs on a reality show, maybe just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid in community centres every year, and they are preparing for impacts in the sector itself that will have further restrictions on funds for already extremely busy services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already rejected when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to burst, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
According to the latest summary report from the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, James Farrell said that 5,000 people are being rejected every year.
Mr. Farrell said that without lifting the federal government's decision, things would get worse.
"The Community Legal Centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families who are separated, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, resulting in thousands of threatened people from Queensland having to find their way into complex legal problems without help.
We call on the state's attorney and senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to prevent this cutback immediately, so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Over the past year, the government of the state has fulfilled its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the community of their clients, and Palaszczuk's government must invest in this important work.
Action for Donald Trump's campaign after a member of staff allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was prosecuted for alleged inactivity after being informed that the director of operations in North Carolina in February pointed a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file handed over by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state, at Charlotte State Court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that for months he had been waiting for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that it would not.
Director Earl Phillip “marked a gun with his fingers, put a right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's kneecap,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the file, Bordini, following a complaint from local and regional campaign management, found that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
"The guns don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate has caused a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that they could intervene owners and arms holders (which is regulated in the US in the Second Amendment of the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and can appoint her judges.
Trump's campaign says the media ripped his words out of context and that Trump didn't advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini is asking for compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and Phillip for endangering personal security, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokesperson, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to a comment request.
The attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news office in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded in a short time to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of restoration and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is in a huge way attractive, just as London 2012 was, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games have produced huge benefits for both Startford and East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching posts, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be mocked on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, economic growth by 211 billion pounds, to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the vicinity of the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow that, in terms of time and budget, introduced an infrastructure investment program for £11 billion, starting with the T5 terminal - which was elected by the world's best terminal five years in a row, after Terminal T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London Games in 2012 were a huge success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It is time for us to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure our business for the future, and leave behind the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in cat and mouse game in ad blocking
Attempts to bypass advertising-blocking programs have turned online marketing into a game of cat and mouse. At least so says one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook stated on Tuesday that its desktop website would change coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims they've bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the community of open source blocking ads and those who try to bypass them has been going on since the blocking of ads was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another fix of its own.
The fact that the company that owns the largest social network in the world has been involved in the war shows just how much of a problem blocking advertisements for industry has become.
According to the study, last year, Pagefair performed a tissue, and Adobe uses around 200 million people worldwide’s advertising filters – almost four times as much as it did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the profits from Facebook ads, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker said that the company is going against advertising filters on desktops, because mobile filters of advertising for mobile applications for social network and Instagram are not working.
Advertising on desktops still represents a profit high enough that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it will update the tool for "ad preferences" to give people the opportunity to better control how ads are displayed.
On Thursday Facebook said that the new filters of Adblock are disturbing them, because they could also block content that is not related to advertising on the site.
"It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," said Facebook spokesperson in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, which is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences, which will give people control.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an event in which on Thursday morning several cars were run over by a woman who probably tried to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in Vaud Canton shortly after midnight in Thursday.
In a statement in Vaud, the police stated that the actor of the "desperate act" lay in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It's clear that the victim, a woman of 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to the police, they have still not been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said to Le Tribune de Geneve attorney Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent an impact?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out," said Hofstetter.
On the basis of two similar cases of the past five years, drivers do not appear to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking along the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was removed from charges for negligent manslaughter after she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in August 2014.
In court, it was said that the victim at the age of 22 had been drinking alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the distress call - had gone in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was “a very special and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about a Thursday incident involving Morges should log in to the police at the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination of LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday it was communicated by the Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings life closer to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations in the LGBT community for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by organizers, foreign visitors spend CZK 3100 a day per person on average.
Gay tourists are available to support their travels special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price relations with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is held this year as part of the festival programme.
It is lectured by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14th.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be a traditional parade on Saturday with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
This year, the parade, attended by thousands of people in recent years, will honor a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat have been celebrating 40 years.
The indisputable handymen Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained both small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš was premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries in the world, were cartoons by artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who designed for a magazine with two DIYs by Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to cooperate and together created the film Kuťáci.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red trick and a ball and radio were given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak television began to be created in the Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were given to the handymen in 1985, this time they were made directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were attended by Beneš' son Mark.
Today there are over 90 episodes with the stories of these handymen, which are all falling apart, but they are never angry at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and Kutilian enthusiasm and finally they are satisfied with their work, which will prove by the famous gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatres and characters or other toys depicting Pat and Mat are the hits of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the signs of fairy tales, we have chosen one sporty one for you and one of life.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend, and she's happy with her.
And what are the things people spend most on at airports?
That's a Friday review from the world's web site.
First medal from the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The Ragby selection of this archipelago defeated the UK team in the finals of the seven-year rugby tournament.
This is the first medal Fiji has ever won for itself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the first precious metal to win took 60 years from sending out the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji takes great credit for success.
But it's ironic that Brit Ben Ryan is.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals as a British citizen, unlike his compatriots, he could be satisfied.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the finals.
In the end, Fiji overtook him, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report came from the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs since 11 months, has had a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother revealed to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, and doctors only gave it a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and never gives up.
He's got perspective.
I saw her introduce herself to the other kids with the words "Hi, I'm Harmonie and I don't have hands, my mother delivered.
Look at the joy the doll has brought.
What are we spending most on at the airport?
CNN's findings show that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel essential store chain has published data for the last year, summarizing the 10 products that customers buy most in their shops at airports.
The water was definitely the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was filled with a large pack of coconut-flavored M&M candy.
And can you guess who's closing the first ten?
You can't eat as the only one of the above things.
CNN says it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win. Murray and Bond were laughing.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have reigned sovereignly in the category of two without a helmsman for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.
At first glance, a disparate couple moved to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, they scored 69th prize in a row in Thursday's final.
How are we different from the others?
We're just prettier, Murray joked already during the Olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the New Zealand couple's dominance.
To be honest, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We're just practicing really hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray more seriously.
Their supremacy is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-metre and a hundred-pound chaser, and the academically-looking Bond is five centimeters shorter and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has had, for example, a charity boxing match.
That's why they don't spend much time together outside rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
Let's just go win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, admits Bond, who also demonstrated at the press conference that Murray is the dominant in the crew.
He was the one who always answered first, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, it destroys its opponents with calm force.
They are moving at their pace, and although they are often not in the lead in the middle of the track, the opponents have not yet found the recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile to the top.
We're just trying to keep the pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 34-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Cup.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to switch to two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, the greatest defeat of their careers seems to have been atoned for, and the dominance has been confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and we didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure that we were mentally good at it, said Murray.
We know they're all trying to overthrow us.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA’s climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Space Study Institute of Goddard developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could prevail.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus seemed to be proud of the earth -like sparse atmosphere, turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the former topography of Venus.
The planet was likely drier than it was on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the sun, which was 30 percent more subdued.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during slow rotation, he exposes his daily side to the sun for almost two months at once," explained a scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats up the surface and creates rain, creating a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and shield the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution that had been hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over a few billion years -- she was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen has escaped and there is only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that is Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as team coach for Colorado Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from his position as coach and vice president of the team’s Colorado Avalanche hockey operations, as the reason he stated the impossibility of participating in the team’s decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have been the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
I spent a long and intense summer wondering how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and the vice president of hockey operations are consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013 thanked him for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to earn 112 points and the first place in Central Division. But Colorado was struggling with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and over the last two years, the games didn't always work out after the season.
The Avalanche team reached a score of 39:39:4 in 2015/2016 and missed five points to win the second wild card in the Western conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
The North Sea oil rig workers are renewing their talks and interrupting the strike.
The leaders of the parties said that wage strikes for oil rig workers in the North Sea were interrupted while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the company of services for the Wood Group oil fields sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current disagreements," the statement states.
Starting next week, we will have a series of day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group reduced rates this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10 % reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell crossed thousands of people off his payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernise its processes - immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
A member of the Scottish parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disagreements of the generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the region’s economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said.
To compare, in 2016 nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in Pleiades
The most recent mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the speed-turning stars from the Pleiades Cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how turning times are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebulllová, researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have been created for over 125 million years.
Now it's turning the fastest.
At the maximum speed of rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of starwind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the age of the star, its speed of rotation is slowing.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on turning speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the bigger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" Pleiades, we see that slower spinning stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebullová said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"The pools provide us with anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, both younger and older stars," Rebullová said.
There's still a lot we want to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their speed of rotation, so to speak, "hanging their dancing shoes on a nail".
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of Pleiades in three studies soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I hadn't volunteered, then wouldn't the qualifying agreement have been concluded and after a few months I could have gone to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without enrolling in specialization education after graduation?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now only a job available in a somewhat distant hospital, but in about six months' time, there could be a vacancy in another place where I would like to work.
So I do not know how to deal with the situation about that six months ago, the question continues.
Matches Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the return on costs incurred in connection with increasing or deepening the qualification of an employee.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being put on not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of workers at work, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialised competence for the pursuit of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly true that participation in specialization education is considered to be an extension of qualification (not as an increase in it).
This means that the Qualification Agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least 75,000 CZK.
No legislation nor does it provide for the obligation to apply for specialization education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is already entitled to pursue the profession of doctor by completing the necessary university studies, although under statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation in which professional experience in another field of specialisation may be included in the specialization education of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
In theory, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questionable situation.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (the Department of Science and Medical Professions), since the Ministry of Health provides a legal advisory and consulting service related to the inclusion in specialization education and its course.
The Czech Medical Chamber, of which each doctor must be a member, also provides the advisory service free of charge.
Syrian Halab doctors are requesting U.S. intervention.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (insurgent parts of the city by government troops), and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, quotes AFP from a letter addressed to the White House.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over East Halab to stop attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
The Russian forces supporting the army, loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop every day for three hours in the Halab region to allow for safe passage through humanitarian convoys.
