Petr Čech: Last minute transfer?
Anything's possible.
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance won't come until winter.
Petr Čech, currently the alternate goaltender Chelsea, is not sitting over the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talks to Czech journalists and prepares for a Czech presentation for a game rehearsal with the Americans and then also for a sharp start qualification about the Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea’s new Premier League season, Thibaut Courtois takes precedence, Czech for the first time in ten years at the London club as an understudy.
Some time ago, there was speculation that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
At the beginning of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in battles with Atlétik and he couldn't even make it to the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He took out two wins and two draws to the French League season, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance in the league, and he broke up with Lille at 1-1 this weekend.
News came out on the tabloid English websites today that they might want Bohemia in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookies, but Czech leaving Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet put a four-to-one course on him.
Peter, is it possible you're still changing your jersey for the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100% in football.
Maybe during the day there'll be an offer that won't be refused.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet what the offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
It would have to be agreed between all parties First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position as to whether or not the club would deal with any offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new assignment?
I wasn't thinking about that.
But there's a lot of players in this situation today, they're all at representative meetings somewhere, and I'm sure there's a lot of transfers to close today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
And you're not pushing to leave, are you?
The situation where I did not catch a new season in the first three games is a new one for me after 15 years of my career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack up and go anywhere.
I want to continue to participate in the Chelsea goaltender fight, and it's up to the coach who he chooses to make the decisions over the next few weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision making?
I'm taking all the factors into account.
Of course, sport is important to me, but I am also looking at it from a personal point of view, which of course belongs to the needs of the family.
Is it possible you'd be fishing for another club in England?
That's a question I never thought would concern me.
But anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect union organizations as civil law.
"As the unions work, middle-class jobs work," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, co-chairing the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud to present, along with the role model of occasional rights by John Lewis, a law strengthening the position of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers equal legal opportunities to prevent discrimination in trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-branch forces
Adapting the Labour Relations Act to allow all workers who face discrimination if they want to join the trade unions, sue in a civil court - and sue compensation or compensation - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other lawmakers are proposing is to retrace the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country, with one breath, promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, including the language, and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to gather, to negotiate collectively and to act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to form a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Realizing that employees in the new nation would need to organize and promote themselves, the Germans included a clause that openly says: “The right to create societies that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Arrangements to restrict or seek damage to this right will be lifted. Measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the promoters and Roosevelt included in it a guarantee that “everyone has the right to create and enter trade unions in the protection of his interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When countries advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in a position of equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is certainly necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organise and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that unions have not reduced the power of the nation, but have expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living for millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who challenge unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights so as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that have raised America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could have shut down all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
On Sunday, the federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which, according to lawyers, would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
A decree enacted by the signature of Louisiana’s Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s order means that doctors may temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and in the meantime they must obtain this authorisation.
"The proposing party will be able to perform its activities legally and in the meantime obtain a permit," states Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent order concerning the law.
Activists for abortion rights welcomed the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision assures the women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the treacherous law to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three out of five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerned doctors from two clinics who were not among the plaintiffs and also asked for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the 11 states that have passed similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Warriors for women's rights to abortion, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this authorisation imposes medical requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion opposed the fact that measures aimed at protecting women’s health and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed due to measures.
The Reproductive Rights Center said that in Louisiana, only one abortion doctor is allowed.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, the group said that the doctor would also stop doing the surgery out of fear for his safety.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said that they would not punish abortion doctors while waiting for the application to be processed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor treatment availability, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video with tribute to their deceased mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In women in Australian rural areas, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIRM Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines can slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers watched women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in elderly women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors can be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynekooncologists who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of distance medical services to overcome the barrier of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of their geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and prevention programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mother Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline of homeowners under 35 could lead to the loss of up to ten million pounds a year when today’s young generation of consumers reaches “the main age group of gardeners. ”
According to the report, on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own homes will be spent on their own gardens.
As other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as parking areas and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of houses owned has fallen from 61% to 43% over six years, one household has the lowest spending on gardening products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society have stated that housing in sublease or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the head gardener’s advisor to RHS, said: “In tenants, plant growing in pots is very popular - when they move, they can take the plants with them. ”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales for this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin at the reunion of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of all of all of Hitler's Youths, had captured atomic weapons and basically showed everyone that he didn't care about their views, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia is showing many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both tense nationalism and the fact that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialistic appetites.
Time seems to pass in the east rather than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war over Europe was long gone, in the east, they thought they had been overlooked for a long time and needed to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930’s, just before the Nazi’s grasp of power, followed by an outburst of nationalism unlike the current situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, beating journalists, destroying uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that's certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians probably miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled in front of them.
Western politicians may have done this to themselves, maybe they didn't pat Vladimir on the shoulder enough, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go and maybe they started underestimating him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He'd clean up at home, pretend he didn't even want to go anywhere and grind knives at home.
Now he's decided to take back the lost position.
Starts slowly, has time.
The leader is probably a life sentence, so where would he be in a hurry?
He trampled the Caucasus, now he trampled the Ukrainians, then it's the dwarfs of the Baltic.
They've been pinching a Russian bear's fur long enough.
I'm sure even China will notice that by now, which is getting a little too high and is definitely looking for the Far East.
And those Germans are also pretty pissed off at Vladimir, how well they're doing, and we gave them that at 45, like, on their ass.
Let's make one new Novorosija in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base, and there's plenty of ours, and as they're being oppressed, they're already trying to tear down some of them.
Our veterans will remember how they were doing in Czechoslovakia.
Well, that Prime Minister of Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, he can be peeled like onions and eat the whole EU of them.
That would be so much to play the great Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And as detonators, we'll use our tribe members who live on their territory.
There's a lot of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed there, they're just being oppressed there, and we're not gonna let that happen, we're gonna protect them.
And once again, the Russian will rule, for what else is he born to do?
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition for which Ivan is proud to dance a Cossack.
Turkey has summoned an American diplomat for a spy report.
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that American charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept said that, according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has bagated the importance of the report and declared that all major states are watching each other.
The older report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, caused a more indignant reaction to the Turkish government.
The Game of Thrones series introduced other tricks of the fourth row
The creators of the Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they bragged about how the tricks of the fourth row were created.
The most visible are computer modifications of the series environment and mass scenes, when a group of soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magalufu Police Director Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the municipality of Calvia to the Mallorian State Prosecutor.
The police director in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after the accusations brought by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magalufu.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after being charged with corruption by several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballen, the street where most bars and night businesses in Magalufu are located.
According to the internet daily Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants presented to the Prosecutor of the Mallorca Anti-corruption Office evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the municipality of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for connection to the corruption charge and will be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC quoted disgruntled night-time business owners, according to which favouring public officials has serious implications for their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," one of the entrepreneurs said in court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got to the main pages of magazines all over the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist on YouTube that gave oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to supervise drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday parties at Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, Playhouse, where there was an event with oral sex, was forced to close for a year and pay a fine of EUR 55,000 ($ 73,000) along with the organisers of the Carnage Bar Tour.
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the fashion wave known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at the airport in Adelaide
JARO brought an ice surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rain and severe winds that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm rainfall is to fall in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm rainfall is due during the night on Sunday.
The last rain presented itself together with a few short showers connected with the storm and gusts of wind, which began before eight o'clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm rainfall.
After a few early doses of spring arrived after the winter last week, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to only 15.8 °C.
Storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land shortly after 7:30, but at short distances hit by a change of speed or direction of wind and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop from the second landing and finally landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently caused delays in further flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to the forecast, the temperature in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israel’s Children Return to School After the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near Gaza returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while during the 50 - day war between Israel and Hamas, missiles and mortars attacked their homes.
The beginning of the school brought joy and excitement to the communities in the south of Israel, but signs of struggle are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the employees of the kindergarten, which was hit by the rocket, removed the remains of the shrapnel from the wall, and slowly await the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bartová, a kibuca Saad resident and an English teacher at a local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their routine.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart revealed that “it’s a little strange” to go back to school at once.
"We've had some hard times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the end of the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and went to safer areas further from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, in which a missile from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, hesitates to return.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families have still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding: “We will provide you with education and security. ”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited rate last Tuesday.
While stopping the fire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key problems as a requirement for Hamas to end the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and reopening airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers fallen in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of the killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired during the battles on Israeli cities mainly in the south of the country 4 591 missiles and mortar missiles.
In turn, the Israeli army has carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 have been hidden in a hundred United Nations schools that have turned into provisional shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of the ongoing struggles, the school officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in the largest city of Gaza.
I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu's temperature is bothering
The Czech football team met today before noon in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent initial match of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the 23 - member cadre, the Spartan attacker David Lafata, has problems with his temperature.
David isn't here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David probably still has a little problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," said coach Pavel Vrba to the press.
"If it's two or three days, or tomorrow it'll be fit, we'll see about his health, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some pain, but it's not like they can't train or take part in a match Wednesday with the USA," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba was called as the last player of Spartan backup Luke Vách.
He admitted that this was not an easy decision to make, and other middle - schoolers were also involved.
I made a decision based on the fact that Luke is a promising player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand by it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latato.
It is not impossible that the nomination could still change in the event of health problems.
On the weekend with great performance flashed for example Liberec Josef Šural, who gave a hat trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata's doing.
In the event that it cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot dominate any of the players who took an interest in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a representation of training in Strahov, on Tuesday a classic pre-game training before a duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by an autographing session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday at 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for the premiere victory under the willow.
In the previous three prep games, he played two draws and once lost.
The qualification contest with the Netherlands is then scheduled for September 9th at 8:45 p.m.
Pešice goes to Italy on the Dutch
The willow is glad to have more time for training than previous meetings.
There is an advantage when you have eight days of players and you can practice certain things with them that we may not have had so much time for before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting ready for the Netherlands as best we can," said Vrba.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will be followed personally by former temporary coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us information that's from the game.
But it won't just be about him, we'll have the game and we'll have the game and we'll talk about it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent World Championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the prices of flats in the winter period have increased most in the last seven years.
According to the housing index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices increased by 1.1% in August, according to the agency on Monday.
The increase resulted in an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9%, more than twice as much in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne run the market.
The RP data show that Sydney’s housing prices rose by 16.1% last year, while Melbourne’s prices rose by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was placed, which was damaged by state-ordered expenditure reductions and where prices increased by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring began, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
"Considering the continuing high level of auction sales, generally high sales speeds and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even more in the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never called me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
He and his father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked in a factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry tries comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "intense" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew so little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were adults - they went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading the papers.
Recently, Henry visited Dudley’s foundry, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he saw what life must have been like for him.
It's a little brighter today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
My dad used to get in the tub and just lay there, and then you could hear him slowly starting to sing for himself because he was washing the foundry off.
When I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
When my mom was sick and dying, we started thinking, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Will you stop "I love you" already?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
French, who he's been married to for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's a good girl.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and started showing symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to take a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiresome.
Nobody wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut chin.
After he received the credit from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theatre.
Followed by Comedy full of mistakes and the Fences of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcoms and comedy that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone, and he wrote about him in the talent show New Faces.
His television career began in the mid - 1970s: “I was the only black impersonator/communist on television for a long time.”
He was studying as he went along.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985, I had to learn how to make functional jokes, be a star and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry and his comedy ended up performing for five years.
My family was nervous about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years of appreciated main product of British television,” but was also“ a grotesque parody of black people.”
In the 1980’s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s, among other things, he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him commercials, documents, TV shows, and roles in the movies, but after his show LennyHenry.tv at the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, it seems like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little out of your way."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 lines for the documentary from Othello's closing statement, and he was already in on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me courage.
“That’s what it’s about. It’s a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was hard, and before that, I read the game for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for trouble, which they didn't.
Soon he began to play in Comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
One minute I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for impounding the audience.
“A voice in my head said to me, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle this for me.
"You play, so stay in the role."
Henry at the Plots in Duchess Theatre
Learning Plot lyrics was a challenge.
Panic's pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like God's sign that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he's saying it in a QUICK voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Henry still remains a comedian's brain - all the time he interrupts our conversation with humorous performances, entering and stepping out of the role of impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having satisfaction in a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I guess.
If you're always looking for something, you can hit a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it like I used to.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps put the outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya began a biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove the government’s non-existent employees from the payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who are not registered in the next two weeks will stop getting paid.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after they have left the service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhura Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars a month ($700,000) on non-existent employees’ salaries and other abuses of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be placed on bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee has left the administration, reported a BBC reporter from Nairobi capital, Wanyam Chebusiri.
All civil servants must report within the next two weeks to the identification centres where their data will be biometrically recorded, as stated in the government statement.
He also says that anyone who does not show up without an apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By determining the actual public service employees, this measure will contribute significantly to its management and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of suspicion of a "conspiracy against the government".
The police department hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking officials were among the detainees.
Some of them were involved in the December corruption investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for the alleged organisation of a criminal gang and telephone wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time the Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the work of Islamic clergyman Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister Arsenij Jacenuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1.
There's peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the combined Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk, attended by Jaceňuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for a tough time.
It carries clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclaves of conservative parties.
She's experienced the front lines herself.
The career began at the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she was executive director of the Financial Times, and she resigned from her post when Pearson's mothership took over her younger colleague.
They say her severance pay was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former BP Director, when Cameron needed a private expertise in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the government.
Her husband's a former city council member.
In May, I described the director's work as a poison chalice.
Not only is the BBC a large and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside to the top layer of the hierarchy of its own BBC leadership, but also out to the public voice in times of restlessness when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly, which calls for thorough reform.
But who would risk coming into a company as complex as a Chinese dynasty, decomposing it, taking his own job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't that hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and its status revised.
With the expansion of the competition and the new technology questioning the old security, the immediate negotiation of licence fees poses a great danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public buys a stake in something that is certainly the largest media business in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each costing only 40 pence a day.
Moreover, the BBC’s popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters compared to 31% ten years ago.
The models of using BBC services have changed: Today, the headlines are displayed on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can look at the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the offensive tweet has not been approved
Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of authority.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was posted in Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet left my account that wasn't authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I withdrew it," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who's actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unflattering, humorous picture of prosecutor Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry rejected the payment for her office, which brought Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet said: “I don’t always drive with three times my blood alcohol levels above the permitted limit... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry for calling me to account for it.”
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry wasn't conducted by Lehmberg's office.
Michael McCrum, Special Prosecutor of San Antonio, was in charge of him, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and he called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked a judge supervising the case to dismiss the charges, because the use of laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut off $7.5 million from the state's Public Interest Fund, which is based in Travis County, and pursues corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection triggered a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active, and sometimes he gets famous.
After finishing fifth place on his party committee in 2012 during his presidential campaign in Iowa, Perry responded to the speculation that he might have ended up tweeting his own picture of him running near the lake and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is going back to normal.
One of London’s most prominent development companies warned that the housing market had “returned” to normal levels of activity in south-eastern England.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble led the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for demanding Berkeley clients, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from its peak point in 2013 to a normal level of transactions."
The London housing market was doing well during the fall, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the data of the cadastral office, prices in the city jumped by 18,5% in the last year alone, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales prices of Berkeley’s private, affordable, and student housing rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, they have not been so attractive to foreign buyers of London in recent months - some of them have also intimidated the introduction of new real estate taxes and the talk of a possible “holiday tax” with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections next May.
Last week, London’s real estate agency Foxtons warned that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, would also slow the pace of market growth for both real estate and price sales during the second half of the year.
The new data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages for July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced home prices to 3% on the basis that home prices have already started to fall.
According to the real estate agency, WA Ellis, meanwhile, in London’s most expensive districts, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, decreased by a quarter each year.
Yet the demand for housing in Berkeley’s capital city was a blessing, because it increased cash for forward sales to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, good - looking housing in a good location remained the same, and this kept forward sales. ”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of April to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits have increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said that it was anticipated that Berkeley’s annual revenues would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley stock stopped at £23.96 this afternoon at the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar Jennifer Lawrence's photos were leaked online because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of new actresses.
The talker of the Stars of Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for a "obvious violation of privacy."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who has stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker originally posted photos on 4chan image sharing server was reported to have gained a gap in the iCloud Internet storage system. According to BuzzFeed, the alleged list of photos of hacked victims includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the movie “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took in the privacy of our home years ago are satisfied with themselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the cable TV series Nicoloodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were genuine. On Twitter, she said: "These supposed naked photos of me are DEBT, people."
It's better to cut it off in the bud.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that the spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs were genuine.
An extraordinary demonstration from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel about love and the letter "J"
They disbanded, it's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposed like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, too complex, too violent, too isolated, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it to himself.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last sacrifice of this ability was a beginning love affair that more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild mane hair and a fickle heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and hospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, who inherited her property in a moist but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the baths, the slugs were lyin' on the windows, as if they thought it belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a house of children's stories, scary and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary nomination list for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat in long grass and held hands, enjoying an unexpected warm spring afternoon, unsuspectingly tuning a public station that supplied the region with comforting music and comforting news, when the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to with his blinds closed.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they didn't play those songs on the radio anymore.
They weren't forbidden -- really, nothing was forbidden -- they just weren't played.
They helped them get into the desuetudo as well as the word desuetudo itself.
People's taste has proved what they could never do by regulations and standing outside the law, and just as people choose memoirs for books, where poor people become rich, cooks and romance novels, ballads are chosen in music.
Kavern got torn down by the day and started playing the imaginary piano and with a rude, comical voice he sang serenade to Ailla's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a popular song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, adding two fingers to his lips automatically.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
Father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth at the beginning of the j word, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny back then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn's never heard one.
Not even jazz, even though it wasn't directly outlawed, they didn't play.
Improvisation went out of style.
There was only room in life for one "if."
When she started playing tunes, people wanted to know exactly where she was going to end up.
Same with humor.
His unforeseeableness got on people's nerves.
And jazz was a humor expressed by a song.
Although he hadn't heard from Sammy Davis Jr. until he was ten, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillen didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when popular singers weren't black.
No laws or pressure, either.
A permissive society is one in which every part of it is grateful - with the gratitude of those who have been happily spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origins with temperament and constitution were suited for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if nature was gifted with electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles left behind were plumbers, Greeks left behind, washing dishes.
Those from the Gulf States and Levant, whose grandparents quickly left the country while what had happened, IF IT HAD HAPPENED - were afraid that they would accuse them of putting them in the fire, in fact, afraid that the fire would spend the next time - they opened a restaurant where they sold labneh and smoked water pipes, not drawing attention to themselves, and inaction slowly consumed them.
To everyone according to their talents.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn hardly understood how the dirty words that Kavern had just sung to her could produce music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," said Kevern.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of security.
From behind the soundproof leaves, not a word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He was going to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said at the end.
She shook her head unbelievably and overshadowed Kevern's view.
In the whole wide world, nothing could be seen but a jumble of her raven hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly feet.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles right now," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Kavern was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and lifted off the deckchair, dropped the radio and spilled the underdrinking wine.
Bezine wine, so it wasn't the drinking.
She seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in a storm in her excitement.
"I'm sickly attracted to you for being a jerk," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes the moment she stood up against him.
Did she think she was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the foundations it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean crisscrossed them.
The same deranged men, then, WHAT HAPPENED, even more touchy and sullen than their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers, were angryly wandering from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who would dare to refuse or mock them.
Jerk?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to cuddle her - to cuddle her became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to the faint ballads about the love that the radio spouted - first to cuddle her, then hit her with one.
In Kevern’s view, over-practice, because cuddling was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him non-verbal to leave.
He got off the couch like an old man.
She felt cranky herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from the upstairs window - a man who was caught up with what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart gripped because of him and all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few had beaten her.
A man turned away from her, shoulders hung, shamed, defeated, all the fighting left him -- why did she feel like she knew that look well, even though she couldn't recall a single moment until today, that she'd seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
Some 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32 - year - old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system of the Public Mood, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate violent acts in the areas of the country where it was reduced or stopped, most expected if enough money and energy had been spent to eliminate it.
"A lot has been done, and a lot still has to be done," she wrote, "to calm down the innate aggression of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the entangled, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of church towers rising over hedges, a hint of human kindness has rarely appeared."
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the impulses.
The inhabitants sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories, and claim to firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, the old brutality is as stubborn as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and aggressive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, roads, and even in sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to be overly lenient," said her supervisor.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme retaliated with her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"I don't ask," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I had something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We're not prejudiced in this workplace.
We serve unbiased societies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is completely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you demonstrated it.
Obviously, you yourself are biased towards the Church - things you call "cruesome" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and energy.
Still dealing with what happened when it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
Behind his head was a pink flashing recommendation on the lightboard, which Ofnow had been sending to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, make a deal, apologize.
Talking is better than keeping quiet, singing the word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she was sure her supervisor had quit, "and I no longer claim that the wound did not heal as we imagined it would.
My first concern is that if we are not aware of this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what had happened when it had happened.
But this time, we won't vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
That was supposed to mean infinite patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when you describe as mistakes the steps they may have taken and perhaps your grandparents have not made.
You also go too far by talking about venting your "rage" and "distrust" on "others."
I shouldn't remind anyone in your position that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we don't talk about "us" and "they."
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
“During which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “no one is blameless.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt that can be blamed on anyone, there are no things that should be fixed, even if the correction is appropriate and possible.
But what's the point of the past other than learning from it -
The past exists so we can forget it.
If there's anything I can say -
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged his fingertips.
"I will take your message into account," he said, releasing her.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk in a way that passersby described as “brutal and furious.”
Coincidences happen.
The army of the Lesoth kingdom claims that there is no coup planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Lesoth kingdom denied organizing a coup for the purpose of overthrowing the government, claiming to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says that the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
After he said he was being threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighboring Republic of South Africa.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, a spokesman for the army, said that it was not really a coup, but an army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were attempting to arm.
"This morning, the leadership of the defense forces of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several reports from the information service that several groups are in the police ranks that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make a mess in the country," he said to the Voice of America.
Spokesman of the South African government Clayson Monyela said that military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power by force, the actions of the Lesothian defense forces seem to bear signs of a coup d'etat," he said.
Military officials of the Lesoth kingdom said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that in his opinion he was the target of the attack because of his efforts to combat corruption in the country.
There has been tension in Lesotho since Thabane suspended the session of Parliament due to internal disputes.
He stated that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his actions to the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month minimum
Production growth, according to a closely survey conducted in August in the euro area, has slowed down to a 13-month minimum.
The final index of euro area purchasing managers (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have decreased and the factories have damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures come from the Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating to 0.3%.
There have been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to that of the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the braking effect of the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist Markit.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 51.4 months.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has again switched from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," said Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to the fire to analysts awaiting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August shopping manager’s production overview is that it shows that the sector is still growing. ”
He added: Producers in the euro area currently have a very difficult life, because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has proven to affect trade - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially the expensive ones.
He stated that as “more likely” it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of Hell survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, thousands of people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
During the three days of suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We returned to Beslan to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
Exactly ten years after the horrifying cast of Beslan school, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the survivors warned of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy has united the East and the West, leading to action and the future in this disastrous disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, southern Russia, to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the school’s atrocities.
We have found wonderful young people who resisted disaster, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will live in them.
What's their greatest wish?
The war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - will be over.
A girl trying to get back into a ruined school gym.
She was captured by Russia's leading photographer Dimitri Beliakov, only trying to climb back into a bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded in her underwear.
Confused Aida desperately sought out her mother Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had recovered fully, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
There's pieces of shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly did not destroy it," she determinedly said.
“It just happened to me, and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, my friends and I try not to talk about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate from the class of JER Gapiev were killed there.
When we were little, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the capture, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are so grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet as I climb through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster, and prevent it from repeating itself.
A boy who escaped with the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school at seven years old) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At that time, a seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run away."
He was afraid she was dead, he ran, and he saw a baby crying on the way, he grabbed the baby by the hand, and they were running with a shower bullet.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me his mother was dead. ”
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in a hospital with a wounded leg and, on the contrary, thought her son had died.
After meeting again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell that memories are fading.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But today I can play computer games that shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I used to play with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember a trip to London well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted at the toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffers because of the war just as he and his friends suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through this horror," says Damir, who took part in last week's volunteer work at the monastery.
I want to help so much.
I want to work with the police one day, and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no children here screaming and running, and the silence took months.
He vividly remembers the trip with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her award-winning foundation and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and helping Damir and me.
I remember Damir's appetite for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think there have been, and a lot of children will be killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice, quiet kid, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to think about it, but he's very close to six classmates, and he goes to the gym from time to time and lights candles.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he threw out all his guns or other toy guns.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and rose to my feet, I looked around and saw this hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember yelling, ‘Damire, run, run!’, but I was convinced that he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her, and he ran away.
So our lives go further than others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy who took the photo after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Comfort: Survivors from Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack on the right Grigory today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was gnawed into his bloody face.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists invaded the yard, so my little boy stayed there alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's getting harder to think about and talk about.
Not a single day goes by without remembering the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Grigory's picture (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I learned he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Grigory crying in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at the picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that this picture of people all over the world is making us feel the pain.
Grigory says today: “It’s important that this doesn’t happen again.
“I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the crash of a booting in Ukraine.
Do we ever find out what the cause was?
This world is going to have something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
To forget a little bit, he needs decades.
It was affecting my health. I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why when September 1 comes, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and began to study medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogori Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregorij Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When the attack was underway, he was caught trapped in a gymnasium sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put behind me.
I'm older now, and they say kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006 I went to a psychologist and felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - this was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in that well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee that I hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But I still couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg because of my health, as I wanted to.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My other hobby is animals, so I got on the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be there.
He's inside, and he's getting worse with his anniversary coming up.
I'll take part in the memorial ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God he gave it back to me, there are tracks everywhere in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he's still carrying on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's over 50% of the fear, but he can't get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and loved.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but it hurts me to lose the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost popped out of my chest when I saw him at the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could pick up all those rebels and throw them away as far away as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took a special commando to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaev carries a Russian special commando (left) to security.
Now she's ten (right) and has no memory of tragedy.
In 2004, the world gasped for air when a Russian police officer carried little Alyon out of the Beslan captivity.
The terrorists released her, but they kept her 30 - year - old mother, a ten - year - old sister, Kristina, and Brother Makhar captive at the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old, escaped, but Alyon’s mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a little girl named Kristina after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the attack, and she has grown to be a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that “they are a big happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better pictures and videos underwater
If you are interested in shooting or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera like GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with several cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Further adjust the camera according to the type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you do that, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof design.
Take a few shots every time - a lot of them don't work out.
Compact cameras have LCD, which will help you with the composition of the photos, but the outdoors don't.
Even if you have LCD, it will be hard to see underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of shots with slightly different exposure variance, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
As the light sinks deeper, it decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the water, swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less color you see.
Get close to the subject.
That's excellent advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the damper light.
This is particularly important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: These devices usually have a firm and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose personality power was able to change things even into such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the sick from pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, treated patients in overwhelmingly interested in something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He struggled with the symptoms of flu and found himself impatient, and his wife, Juliet, was filled with remorse.
He noted: “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later. ”
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
One week before, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-rays came back.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or the lining of the lungs.
In most cancers, it's hard to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoke.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause of exposure to asbestos — a building fibrous material previously referred to as “miraculous, ” but today it is known to be fatally dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry entered into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people, such as isolation treasurers, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers, came into close contact with it.
The toxin used in the industry in another era is now hard to see as cause for concern.
But such complacency is not appropriate.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is at its peak in Britain today.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year from this disease are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths resulting from mesothelioma every year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not just concern veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases it is still present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
Thus, Mesothelioma does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged bastions from London’s department stores to public schools do not represent shelter.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even lay in isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he could partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who later manifested themselves as mesothelioma in the last five years," he remarked in his letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will become sick with the same disease? ”
According to Britain’s leading mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, some 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea he's going to die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
By looking at the files from the archives of the courts, which often turn to and require compensation, it shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted to exposing Asbestos Janice Allen negligently.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised in two stores on the clothing section - one of the places was the flagship of the company, the Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children who are in their 20s.
"Before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, barely knowing anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed he'd have anything to do with me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given thanks to its fibrosus structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Most often it is possible to find chrysotil, commonly known as white asbestos in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
But brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (cropydolit) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of an unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient study claims that “a significant proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by "normal use and ventilation" of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the midst of government may not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms are contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibers could be breached by something as harmless as “a strong stream of air.”
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's Service Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace be given a "priorary medical certificate", it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed for Parliament to be thoroughly examined, the electricity will be modernized and the asbestos removed, and that, after the 2015 elections, Members will be sitting on the Green benches in Westminster in the premises of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Centre.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations. ”
There's no telling if this inconsistency will cost lives.
Everyone can only wait now.
One person who has never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos was shown to be present," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overcome by something like chills.
He was 45, he was in the evening, and he was in the middle of an operation.
All of a sudden, I'm shaking.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't going home in my car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the pleura, the linings around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and put in a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent out of his lungs for analysis.
Still, they didn't diagnose it.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and subsequently was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and was in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray photos with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera probe was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of the lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take too much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't really worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year's: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott started seeing the sisters of the Macmillan charity, and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It has been shown that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
The disease is now beginning to manifest among those exposed to asbestos in these buildings.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have a risk profession.
Asbestos - thermally isolated, the most dangerous pipes in hospitals were located in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, staff members who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement cafeterias (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with toxic substances.
As it now turns out, several decades after the hospital war, they were a place where they could save patients' lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is being removed to this day.
The students built Bunsen's kahan on asbestos mats
And it's not just the hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city hall because of its excellent insulation and non-flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in myriad chemistry classes, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos mat.
A website was created dealing with asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer representing Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s when she broke down a garden house.
So be careful how you tear down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I can't concentrate on what I'm doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things to do was move from doctor to patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I've been told it's been 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I won’t live to see another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - the breathing itself - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers breathe in, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and may cause cell mutation.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibres in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knew and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during their practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles enter the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and “the breath itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
Its nature has been invasive from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, the common treatment options used in other cancers do not work as much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is discussed hotly.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “does not respond very much to chemotherapy, ” which does not “have any effect. ”
"Sometimes there is someone who survives lung cancer," Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after Graham Abbott's own diagnosis, he's still fighting.
After finding the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advisor to the equally disabled.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: “Hello, you have reached the cancer center. ”
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with illness four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last for four months, and would likely only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “has shown things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and they would have to approve his payment.
In order to get to the best treatment available, the question of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments inevitably fail, many patients face further financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898 it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health," Morgan says.
In the 1960 ’ s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And this is where we meet the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't prove definitively that the mesothelioma was the result of an asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After the investigation of the case, however, spokesperson Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminating basement area was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Seducing exposure of lethal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces changed owners or went bankrupt.
The insurance records have gone missing.
And those who now oppose the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been passed this year, making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if it is not possible to track down their former employer.
The law created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve, which is covered by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount that would normally be charged by the court as compensation - approximately £120,000.
300 successfully completed applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks that £350 million is "good work."
"It is an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if it hadn't taken time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to track down former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But both Penning and Morgan admit that due to seven deaths each year, quick action was necessary.
"People are suffering too much and need help now," Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act last December.
Graham Abbott has been in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended the operation, which unlike Tom Treasura thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - triple therapy, in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a survival rate of up to five years in 40% of patients.
Abbott's made it stronger.
"Of course that's not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it with patients all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent an operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Checks showed no signs of disease.
I went to the next check in March [2014].
I had a few stains in my chest.
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It's not life-threatening.
He's into it.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his body.
But it's both physically and emotionally exhausting.
You have to think of practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how an alarm clock works on a boiler.
When you hear the bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not lightened by hope or by a hint of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually also brought Stephen Jay Gould) a gloomy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “the limit does not threaten life. ”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
Despite the growing debates on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the elections in 2017.
It is likely that this move will trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began to organize and prepare just a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows Communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were angry," said the legislator Emily Lau, chair of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Li Fei National People's Congress said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's elections would cause "chaos".
Since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, Britain has promised Beijing that from 2017 onwards, the people will be able to vote for executive power.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decisions as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but it also makes it clear that China’s leaders are holding firmly in the hands of the nomination process of a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of the largest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are behind the Occupy movement of the Centre with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial district if Beijing did not grant them universal voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks it would launch waves of protests.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their Internet statement, organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as the last step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice left.
We must regret to announce that all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted today, and the occupation of the Centre is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing’s announcements for days, strengthening the protection of the government’s headquarters on Sundays, and deploying police officers and barricades.
Inciting unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There is also a growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise the Centre occupation movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - Hong Kong lifeboat.
"The protest they are talking about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We don't want the fear of Hong Kong getting out of control to spread.
Such perceptions could damage investment.
China’s state media has also recently come up with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong portray as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, with 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
Pre-election agit?
The League in Jihlava bears the title according to the political movement
A small football is played in the regional town of Vysočina by approximately 1 600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is newly named Together for the Jihlava League.
The name was given according to a movement going into the October municipal elections.
In addition, Jan Mrák, the chief of small football in Jihlava, is the tenth candidate.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," Mrák said.
Situations around the first league of small footballs have already been dealt with by lawyers of Jihlava City Hall and recommended changing the system of distribution of subsidies.
Last year, according to the city's website, a small football game won about a million crowns.
This year, it's an amount of hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the procedure of a small football is not contrary to the laws or regulations of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to modify the rules for awarding grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulips, spokesperson for the Magistrate.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time to express as a little footballed support in the elections of one political party, I don't think that's possible anymore.
A similar requirement from politicians has not yet come to high-end "big" football.
That would be created by ČSSD regional championship, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and all that stuff?
I wouldn't be in favour.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from among companies to turn to us," said the president of the Regional Football Association Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of small football will not allow another party and the movement into the name of the league
According to players of small football, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own area with six playgrounds, locker rooms and bathroom.
"For example, the course Na Stoupách is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ondřej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Český mlýn.
However, there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a senseless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mrák warned.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymála (ODS) responded that a small football player uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning the modernisation or construction of sports facilities at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been great progress for a little football in recent years," he said.
According to Jan Mrák, other political parties in the names of the league will not appear.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field enters our partnership, we don't put the other one there," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the League, I consider this to be an unfortunate move at least," said Karel Voldán, member of the City Council Committee for Sport.
"But whether the voters evaluate whether Mrák is using the Little Kicked Jihlava association and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jets
We are pleased that we can respond to demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said that the service has a security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to making sure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury with our VIF (very important freshman) variants this year.
The company’s spokesman said that since the services had just started, they had no reservations, but he added: “Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks. ”
The company also stated that although students pay an annual tuition of £9,000, they expect the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF is exactly the right way to do this.
But the national student union criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, commented: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students entering university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as coming to college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists are opposed to racism and police behavior after the Ferguson events
At the beginning of the month, a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
The present waiting for the funeral with their hands up chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri to shoot an unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in online discussions between white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equality of income, white feminists favor gender over race.
With the increasing tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the white woman’s response was concentrated on race in 100%.
Compared to black women's reactions soon after the 9th August shooting, personal articles with titles such as "contemplation of a white woman over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privileges at that level," she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves to what happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis that we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially exclusive that they had to draw attention to it.
According to English professor at Ohio State University, Korith Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-American women face every day and which are not perceived in the cultural sphere as "female questions".
"I can publish funny stories on Facebook about my life with my partner and get 150 likes from people from all over the world," said Mitchell.
When I write something about colored people being trapped in their own country, it's quiet deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who dealt with the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and sex.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: they live every day in this mixed reality.
Although white women today combine the issue of race and sex in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women's questions and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of a white woman.
According to Hattery, the split between white women and black women came when a electoral right fighter like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet cards on the right to vote for women and to focus on the right for black people later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the questions raised in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “catch up” on the questions that black women faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists on these premises [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" said Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career by fighting for reproductive law and access to contraception is now finding out what it means.
Major feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took Michael Brown down by Facebook two weeks after she was shot, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian demanding that white Americans protest more strongly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different, yet similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions on race that differ significantly in opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates inter-sequential feminism, which involves issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
An expert at the American Enterprise Institute, Christina Sommers, author of the book “Who Stole Feminism?”, said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s comments on Ferguson face criticism that she had already provoked.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a little My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it triggered an angry reaction for many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After America's border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied teenagers in the southwestern country this year, the question of reforming immigration laws has come up again - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to raise the question as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them, they find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a response in women's organizations," she said.
A pig's residence in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed a picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig rested on it in the living room.
A one-bedroom self-contained house for sale for £120,000 is on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the sofa pig.
The Connells real estate agency said that the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo was found there by mistake, and therefore it was already removed," the spokesperson said.
In the real estate information, Connells described the former house of prayer as "an isolated one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest in social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million dollars.
There's a search going on for a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, and one lucky guy takes $1.1 million home from the lottery haul on Saturday.
The Harvey trades were lucky for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 was a prize of one million dollars.
But the lucky winner still has to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the whole town in the southwest of Perth was talking about winning.
It's the main topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a win like this was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one win last month, culminating in a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five august millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winnings would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning 85 million dollars in total.
Deutsche Bahn trains won't go tonight.
The engineers want higher wages.
In a press release, GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which he deliberately chose time off the rush hour.
In the chosen time of the strike, the GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend by rail only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people arriving for work during the day," said the trade union on Monday morning in a press release to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should hit mainly freight transport, less passengers," added the GDL.
The DB has not yet published an official response to the announcement of the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions demand an increase in the wage of drivers by five percent and a reduction in working time by two hours a week.
Currently, the average salary of drivers varies depending on the years worked between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
The drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept salary increases when working time is reduced.
They stress that the wage assessment of drivers must develop in the same way as for other railway staff, for which DB does not count as a reduction in the working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn't even think something like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have been temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would have switched it?
If we were to head straight there, yes.
But there were two more stages waiting for us, and we couldn't.
It's got a high temperature, and the risk of the car starting to burn is high.
I can't afford that.
You've passed five speed tests at full speed.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, and I didn't go over the vine.
Everything was caused by the fact that the car was piling for more than six months to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You started it so that you could actually think about winning.
I prepared my car and myself so that we could really win.
Work didn't go to waste.
On the other hand, the result we could think of was not there.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one who stepped out of the first place early.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi also fell out of it.
Are you surprised that so many favorites have resigned?
Yes.
Especially for the audience, it was a shame, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, who you are preparing a car, has been at the top for a long time.
But he got off the track and took on almost a two-minute manko.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the podium.
I mean, he's done his first second time.
But even Mira confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He was going really fast.
You announced the end of your career exactly a year ago, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum Rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular rally participant?
Certainly not at the moment.
Last year, I said Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't keep it.
I've decided to go again.
It was my 19th launch here, and if there's another chance in a year, I think I'll do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Does that please you?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumka?
The team's moving on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't damage much here.
In addition, Jan Sýkora wants to borrow from us for this race.
Mira and I will have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to prepare things for next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsica Rally belonged to the World Cup, you reached your maximum in the series with the fifth place.
Aren't you tempted to try the tracks there again?
It's not tempting.
An oral agreement with an employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not get a doctor to issue a certificate of incapacity for work, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify your employer of your absence.
Consequently, although there was an agreement that the days would be registered as holidays, the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent to the taking of leave confirmed in writing, this practice has proved useful in practice.
If there is only an oral agreement, you have no confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the use of the leave, as in your case, may be considered as long-term unexcused absence, therefore the reason for the immediate termination of the employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a lawsuit about an agreement with your employer, you lack demonstrable proof.
The employment relationship with you has not been cancelled according to Section 53, only you have given the days listed in the credit sheet as an unforgivable absence.
Unforgivable absence in the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (e.g. the impossibility of receiving material security in unemployment), yet this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you see a doctor again and have him confirm in writing that there has actually been an accident, as a result of which you have been unable to work (this is not a so-called "incapacity", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to take up leave.
You will avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on the way back to the track
Back on track, Tony Stewart ended up halfway behind Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence for the second time after his right front tire broke in the 172nd round, and the race ended for him.
Stewart brought the wrecked car to the garage, didn't say anything to the reporters and left.
His team leader Chad Johnston said car team number 14 is disappointed, but he's going to focus on the Richmond race, Virginia, next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we do better there.
Stewart hit the fence for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
"We were hoping for a good ending in today's race," said Johnston, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to catch up on the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident involving the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into the race.
Authorities said it would take at least two more weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion had warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, worked his way up to 10th place at the beginning of the race, and then even 4th place at the beginning of the race.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart's, sending both cars to the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to the 21st place.
Prague has selected a new taxi site manager, earns 12,3 million
Prague has completed tender procedures for the new manager of taxi stations.
For 103 parking spaces, it receives approximately CZK 12.3 million a year.
Until recently, it collected CZK 150,000 a year for the same seats for taxi drivers.
Alderman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09) informed about this.
Back in the day, the city used to draw lots to select administrators.
The winner then obtained a lease for a lump sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently decided.
"The year since the termination of the original lease contracts and the opening of the tender procedures has proved that the new lease system is far more advantageous and fairer in general for Prague," the councillor argues.
The most expensive spot is in Perstine
The highest price was offered to the candidates for a post on Na Perštýn Street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million a year.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million were paid by new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or in Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi stations were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year the original lease contracts were cancelled.
The selection process took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 habitats.
We had to clean the well for the second time this year.
We let it out every time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the cellar always provided plenty of wonderful scented water.
And it wasn't exactly professionally done, Grandpa scooped it out with his own help.
A long time ago.
She's been on three rounds, and she's all peculiar, like everything else in the cabin, but like I said.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, we thought the water didn't smell right.
We were wondering if something fell in.
In the place where the pump went through, it was possible at a bit of bad luck, there was not quite an impenetrable plate, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing was visible in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we've released it again and refined it.
Of course, we've improved the improvised gasket around the pump pipe.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky package on the floor with some cubes on it.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
By the ceiling, in the places where the vents are, Grandpa's invention, there were fish leftovers!
And heavy jet!
Our basement's peculiar, too.
Some would say grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just smothered sand, only the ceiling is undercut.
It's mostly used by boats.
And the wheels.
And deck chairs on the beach.
The doors with wide gaps were usually open as someone walked in there all the time.
At the ceiling of several previously mentioned vents.
Without a net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on beams.
It's useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to deflate, and it did.
Now, of course, not even a luft has helped.
The whole basement stank.
So we cleaned out the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We threw away stuff that was around: planks, heraclit board, that sort of thing.
Our remote cabin was welcoming bystanders with disinfectant odor.
We were wondering who might have pulled the disgusting leftovers in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She'd hardly come to our house to have a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not all right.
Did he put the disgusting things in the vent?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to watch the cellar and the well regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, just for washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water out of a forest well isn't something I'd like to do for a long time.
We once heard our bitch's terrible, anxious bark.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza was jumping over her and whistling like crazy.
Mom scolded her because she thought Réza had dug the garbage hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partially twisted into a ball and partially straightened out.
A hissing hit the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
A snake, over a metre long and thick as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Réza was defending her.
It wasn't clear whether she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the odds of our entire family, she probably thought we should eat it when we were so hungry, and sleek gracefully into the basement.
We followed her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind a well.
By the way, we picked up another stinking package on her board.
Smells like a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a grift.
And we locked the basement during the day.
That's...
We went out, and there we all fell to one vent.
We didn't wait long.
The well was a mess.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then a whole snake went up on the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to conquer inside.
Fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
After he was released, he bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He was able to spend the money he received before the police were detained.
Within a short time, the man bought a total of 16 computers in 12 cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After the takeover, he took the notebooks to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," said Rostislav Brückner, Chief Commissioner of the Šumper police.
The motive of fraud was revenge on the employer for his release and also profit of money.
"In interrogation, he told us that he had used the money to pay off the loans," Brückner said.
Police have also found out that the fraud is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated in psychiatry.
The money could also have ended up in winning machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money on him," said the Commissioner.
An impostor who has been punished once for theft is now facing a prison term of one to five years.
So far, the police have not reported whether there is a threat of punishment to the bazaars that bought and sold laptops below the price.
"It is true that they were taking over brand new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route that brought the target to the navigator instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race along with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to greet our readers personally at the stand where we took pictures together and made videos.
In order to achieve perfection from the other side, I accepted the role of personal conductor.
My friend Katya and I were obediently ranked at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who walked by us in the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of warm-ups, turn on the sportssters, countdown and start!
Shouts of exultation, but instead of a quick start followed by a brittle to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, turn on the measurements and start at a pace of ten.
We intertwine with the yellow snake runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost to a cheesy breath.
The pulsing flesh stretching along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
Traditionally, on the embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it begins to show who has the strength.
A light hill on Palacky Square forces many runners to slow down or cross into walking.
Just before crossing the Theatre, I see a police escort flying right behind him Vítek Pavlišta at an incredible pace to the finish line.
I hear other runners sighing admirably.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, encouraging him, about to high-five me, but just before that, my leg will sprain and our hands will just disappear.
The Divadelní street cycle gives you a chance to relax and breathe for a short time.
It's necessary, there are places in front of us where the views will blow my mind.
The turn on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my feet carry me almost alone.
There's a moment of truth behind the first refreshment.
During the crossing of the road Kaťa švartne by the curb and performs the jump floaty.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm starting a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues through Kozí street, it is one of the narrowest places of the track, at this stage of the race there is no longer such rush, but it is still necessary to keep an eye on the surroundings.
I don't know yet that the term narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to clap with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise Katya, because ten claps with fans are like half an energy bar.
It really works, we're speeding up again, and even though we've fallen through quite significantly, now the fighter ride has begun.
We outrun dozens of runners, when I miss someone particularly tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
After the last refreshment, no one's getting ahead of us, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but you really need to work hard.
The sun has set and the end of the day is symbolically slowly ending the race.
Last run to the bridge, turn and just a straight to the finish line.
The pace we're running, I'm amazed at where it comes from in that girl.
"Come on, we're going under 13, we're working!" I'm calling.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
An hour of 13 and six seconds.
Well, what can we do?
Coach put in an hour-twenty limit.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the target, Kata's legs break, I help her to the railing where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from well done performance.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of target space.
Euphoria doesn't make us think about pushing through the dressing rooms.
You can see that Goat Lane wasn't the narrowest place.
That's the goal of a navigator that's under attack of nearly 10,000 runners crammed to burst.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's no place for them.
Even after a while, I lose my mind and wonder if the beautiful views and the more interesting route was worth what was going on at the finish line.
I know from experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If 10,000 people add to this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transportation, this is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
Excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Spa has moved between the runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and random viewers escalated it on every metro line.
Unfortunately, during the urban run of the historic centre, obstacles that cannot be eliminated must be reckoned with, but the aim of the mass race in a place bordered on the wall and on the other side by the river is not the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I think it's a very good one.
I was a little worried about the health of those involved, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write us into the discussion whether you also liked the route and what you say about the situation at the finish line.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest rally before the Justice Ministry in the capital of Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their request to reintroduce the original working conditions that have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The guards symbolically protested the new working hours for a month and demanded a return to the original 24 - hour shifts.
Although prison guards’ unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) informed.
"The negotiations are still ongoing," said BNR Head of the General Directorate of Rosen Zhelyazkov Prison Service.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Workers' Unions at the Ministry of the Interior will also join the protests of the employees of the prison service.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them?
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green, Columbia University, was hit black in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the caterpillar of the problems that many theoretical physicists today deal with - an attempt to unite two perfectly functioning but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
Undoubtedly, one of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
The physics fundamental problem between two key theories (at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) solved and solved so imaginatively that it was worth retelling to the laymen.
Moreover, Greene dealt with the complex material so fresh and appealing that he cannot be blamed for how much interesting it did not include in his book.
Moreover, he mostly corrected his "mistake" in two other books: the structure of the universe and the hidden reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object if his book were to age faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential to what an informed layman with ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that it will be a little more lively in this area in the coming years (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter Greene's non-violently open door in the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Yet it is specific and totally acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes from the universe as a whole to something more thready, specifically a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine pulling the 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scene from a half-mile distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance, you can easily record the length in the horizontal direction of a stretched hose, but if you are not suffering from sharp vision, you hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its large distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at that moment, you only answer it with one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a half mile away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle of a rotating hose.
In this enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimensional in/contrast direction of movement of clock hands", i.e. around the circular section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you have to enter two numbers: how far is it from the end of the hose and where there is a rotating hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note experts notice that this chapter focuses purely on the faulty string theory.
He discusses non-disturbing aspects in chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimensions along the hose are long and easily visible.
The size of the retracting hose circuit is short, "wound" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
That they're split into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, convoluted, and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not just prejudge ourselves to reveal the "convoluted" dimension of the threading hose thickness.
All you had to do was take a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we'd only discover the convoluted dimension with great effort.
In 1919 the Kaluza sent Einstein his article in which he came forward with a staggering idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of our known dimensions.
Kaluza's radical claim was justified by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be vetoed into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately, the question of how this Kaluz observation goes along with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and specified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and convoluted dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions that we realize at any moment.
But analogous to the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, firmly rolled into a space so tiny that they have remained hidden from our most sophisticated experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer picture of the nature of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stick to the hose for a little while longer.
Imagine drawing a relatively dense line of circles on the hose circumference in black.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now thanks to the drawing, we will discover the convoluted dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, so four spatial dimensions combined.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, note the illustration of Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we increase the view of the geometry of the space as we increased the surface of the hose.
Each of the following levels represents a huge enlargement of the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of magnification) if they are rolled into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not seen them directly.
The square network represents the commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle represents a new, tiny and convoluted dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - just because of visuality we only plot them into intersections in a square network.
The background of Figure 4 illustrates the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common standards as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a square network.
On each of the following pictures, we will focus on a small area of the image before; we will enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, when we move on to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3, we see a new circle shaped like a coiled dimension, similar to the loops of the threads in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions similarly as the hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we only plotted the circular dimension in some regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 summarises Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also record important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far spreading spatial dimensions (of which we only drew two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
The more important difference is that we're talking about spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular coiled dimension is extremely miniature, it is much harder to recognize - like the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe apparent, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed beyond the powers of our most modern enlargement tools.
But most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a round bump within normal dimensions, as two-dimensional illustrations falsely suggest.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of three normal large dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of the top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions and we would need four figures to determine its position, except for the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for an e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, we find that, although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz's and Klein's thinking shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional convoluted dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a metre.
We can barely see the smaller condensed dimensions.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas of just-beginning quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be approximately one Planck length, that is, the size far beyond the distinctiveness of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzo-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: part 5
The whole point of "twelves" lies in a twelve-stroke harmonic form, which you can repeat freely.
He who gropes in musical theory finds its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating a puppeteer and a puppeteer whose Facebook profile can be traced here, he has been living as a graphic artist since graduation 20 years ago.
She is a guitarist of the Wohnout band, which is said to be impossible to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, just like Brother Matěj, leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythm model is only for you, you can invent anything, then you can apply it to the harmonic model 12," advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza do what she can do with the twelve-string harmony on two strings and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you put on the third string, you can already flirt with the tune of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for the tuning change, Honza alerts in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonica and you'll try to fix her up with just the 12.
So train her honestly.
As best as possible, you can read it in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, he recognizes Hradecký Dvořák
We'll take the point, and we're happy for him.
The first half was more likely for us, the second home," said the attacker, who scored this time from the penalty kick.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't particularly notice it, although on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You settled the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal out of the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the beginning, we were passive, it came from a corner, and then a penalty.
After that, you got up, and the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the goal we played well until the break.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep up the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is also probably true that the landlords said something about their game during the break, they probably weren't very happy with it.
You only scored on the pitch for the first time, while you may not have even scored a goal at home.
Why is it so different?
I don't think it's that different, but it's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was wrong of us, Plzeň, that is another category.
Four games you were waiting for a goal, weren't you worried that it might be similar after the last game?
Perhaps not, but of course we are glad that since last game we do not have to listen to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which is not yet for the big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a mile away crater.
The lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries the scientists the most...
The situation remains constant for now.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still leaves the crack of approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous flare from 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
Scientists, however, fear that the lava tunnel might open even in places under the ice.
If this were to happen, with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökulsá a Fjöllum and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur around the eruption, and clouds of steam and gases are rising from the crack.
This is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also many more gases," says Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, and in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
The trail of the sandstorm was washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations, the orange grade (second highest) applies to Bárðarbunga and the yellow stage (third) for Askja.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
Walked on the wings
It's an air day in Cheb.
The aircraft acrobat Peggy Walentin was introduced on the Boeing Stearman PT-17, which in flight climbed from the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There is only depended on the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb took place for the fifth time this year and the organizers managed again to prepare some interesting flying pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking on wings" performed by the German acrobat Peggy Walentinová, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his shining cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the USA.
After World War I, many former war pilots were thus trying to push through.
But because of a large number of fatal injuries, he was banned.
Today, however, it slowly returns to the flight days program.
Peggy climbs from the cockpit to the upper wing after takeoff.
That's where he performs all kinds of exercises.
At the end of the performance, she moves into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," said Luděk Matějíček of the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the surface with the Grippenny Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so called the numbers).
Air fans in the Czech Republic could see such a lineup for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone breathtaking acrobatics with aircraft from 1945.
It was made during the war, but it was probably never there.
He was listed in military reserves.
Since 1963 he worked in the civil sphere.
Even as a raceplane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiště.
In the same place is also another pearl of Cheb air day, a two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the massive machine was not missed.
Its polished aluminum cover shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colors of the French air force was also admired.
A small transport plane jumped behind the abandoned Turbolet and from the German Hof brought a part of the German delegation on the air day.
German neighbors demonstrated themselves in Cheb with reconstructed aircraft How 18T or three-member formation of biplanes Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: A dramatic return to the camera!
Lucie Borhya traded her parents' concerns for at least this evening for the work.
Stress or nervousness - blonde host obviously doesn't know any of this.
The TV news moderator was doing well as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months at all!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended on a six-week period in which women experience the most stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not regularly show up in the main TV Nova news session.
Regular return is expected according to information Blesk.cz not for a month.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her now more than TV viewers.
Lucie Borhy went back on the TV screen, and it was a hit in the black.
Exhibition for a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, planning the Jagr bachelor party.
It would be dignified if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union will stand up to it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which a stunning nagan team met again.
Even the players who participated in the gold hattrick.
Players would like that, wouldn't they?
Absolutely.
It would simply be good to say good-bye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they can be found during the tournament for one or two days, when it is completely free and where you could mix such a match.
We'll tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Buda Šcherban (the organiser of the Jihlav struggle) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
Well, if I'm gonna fly in...
You don't want to play in the representation.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow alter your decision?
The representations and the exhibition matches are two different things and the performances are decisive in the representation.
It's one thing people would like to see me there, but performance is crucial, especially for the World Cup.
There should be players who can do it and not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed in any way.
How did you enjoy the Nagan reunion?
Just the meeting with the players was great.
You liven up stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to remind us of the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Do you still remember your first representational game?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, joined in one three.
It was the first representative start for everyone.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, we couldn't say that.
Dominik Hasek caught in Jihlava after a long time.
What did you think of his performance?
I'll never be surprised by Hashan on the ice.
I wanted to pay him back with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagra for the reasons why he decided to end up in the representation).
Even Rotten's a great show.
He was with me one night training, and there was a leak.
And now he's been doing great.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, the footballers begin their qualification
On Monday morning, prominent guests were coming to the NH Hotel in Smíchov.
People could see the goaltender Petr Čech from Chelsea, the representative coach of Pavel Vrbu...
And over there, the character in the black hat, that's Tomas Rosický!
Arsenal's retainer and the captain of the representation arrived at the meeting around 11:30 between the last.
We're going to have a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" he said, when already in the representation kit he appeared in front of the journalists.
Programme of Czech Representation
Monday 1st September: beginning of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Letná) Autogramiade (20:00)
Wednesday 3rd September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of meeting
Rosický and spol. can support fans before Wednesday's match against the US (20:15).
The representation opened Tuesday training for them, which begins at 6:30 p.m. at Letná.
And he will be followed by an autographing, which neither Rosický nor Czech will be missing.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be calmer.
Which is commended by coach Vrba, who complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now let's focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage to have a player together for eight days.
We will have time to rehearse things that have not been there so far," said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has had three games under the willow, all prepared.
She tied 2:2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
It's just now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could manage the rehearsal against the US.
The first six months were for us to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
David Lafata is the only player of a 23-man nomination with health problems.
It's the temperature that's bothering him.
If he hadn't recovered by Wednesday's game against the U.S., Coach Vrba would have called in one more attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how, after misdiagnosed for many years, she thought she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her growing up thinking she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK charity said that bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
In the United Kingdom, CMT is believed to be suffering from approximately 23 000 people, which may manifest motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking, and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in the affected patients, this condition is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her 18th birthday, she'd be tied to a wheelchair and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as the others.
I fell every day, and everything took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was 13 and was after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought by the time I turned 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I'm 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my powers.
I was on my own, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk was not as bad as she expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up and hugged her and said: “Honey, I don’t think you have the disease, otherwise you’d be in a wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something far less life-threatening."
After several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The CMT UK charity has launched a month of information on CMT to draw attention to this disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington region: Taxes are being raised with the economy’s turnover
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local corporate taxation in a country with accelerated economic recovery increased slightly last year, and Washington companies were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia put together $27.6 billion into state and local cash registers for the fiscal year 2013, which is 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - state and local - rose by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third growth year in succession after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to a study carried out by Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 4.3% faster than local levies by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, shows the least tax revenue from business proportionally.
Researchers claim that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which has increased by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years with growth of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York, and Texas, the situation seems to be the same in Washington.
Last year, companies in D.C., Maryland, and Inrigina paid over ten billion dollars for both state and local property taxes, which, compared to 9.6 billion in 2012, represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not drive up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the real estate tax represents less than a fifth of the company tax.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., real estate tax accounts for almost half of state and local taxation.
"In Maryland, there are a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organizations that don't pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, CEO of Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to data, business income also appears to be increasing.
Companies in this region have published a corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, most of all in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing at the same rate in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the level of the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the increase in taxation was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has 6 % of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation) of the company’s lowest income tax.
The rate of taxation of companies in Maryland is 8,25 %, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, at 9,975 %.
A similar study carried out this year by the US Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the State continues to meet the income targets in the coming year, the statutory income taxation rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, so they pay higher government and local taxes.
Trade tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - the cost-raising structure by increasing prices, according to which most companies are organised - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20% to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and national increase in trade tax will likely continue next year, with total sales income for state and local governments increasing to 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may be lagging behind others, because the reduction in state spending is taking its toll on the labour market.
What did you miss: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the southeast of Ukraine, where government forces have been clashing with pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support given to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is, according to him, contrary to democratic values.
In his view, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukraine crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has earned the right to disagree with part of the
The European Commission, together with its diplomats, is to propose within a week the form of further acknowledgment of anti-Russian sanctions, decided on the EU summit tonight.
The permanent chairman of the meetings of the Member States, Herman Van Rompuy, told journalists.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for shifting the form of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU President.
Van Rompuye will be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU President, who manages the summits of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years he will replace Herman Van Rompuy.
At the head of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian woman, who will become Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament in her capacity.
Assisted death is reality in the Czech Republic, just not to be talked about
Helping an incurable and long-term patient with a life-saving experience?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Yet, the statements of the doctors who addressed the LN indicate that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter in neurology, says the doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of approximately 300 people, 21 patients undergo experimental treatment with stem cells in Motole in Prague.
We definitely don't know if it's going to be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
There's a CIA manuscript in it, they needed a war, Huml's writing about the shooting down of flight MH17.
The MEP for ČSSD Stanislav Huml knows who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "hard sanctions, which were declared with respect to the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead, were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislator, it also makes it possible to know the CIA's handwriting.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are coming and the parties are offering the impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and cable car above Prague.
It is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Now, too, with the forthcoming municipal elections, politicians are overcoming who will be more pleased with voters.

70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkerque.
A severe siege began
It was on 30 August 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Fox has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
Finally, the British Party complied with this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.

How to Survive a Vacation Return?
Take your time and get some sleep
The last days of vacation are ahead of us.
Getting used to coming back from a sunny beach or cottage to a normal working pace can be a challenge for many.
Even depression can accompany him.
Fortunately, there are good tips on how to cope with the changed situation: not hurrying and enjoying a good night's sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "We keep our fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today she's not losing hope of recovering an 85-year-old comedian.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
Fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services, according to which she suffered cardiac arrest on the Yorkwill endoscopy on the Upper East Side, as the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious.”
The reactions did not take long to wait, including incredible online support from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted subtitle
That the media twists reality with their headlines is not (unfortunately) news.
I know the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's the fact that I've been having a lot of trouble lately, and the more accurate is the word that pisses me off.
This concerns, in particular, articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel Attacked Gaza" are quite common.
It is only in the text that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to fired missiles from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the announced truce.
That's when the headline "both sides have broken the truce" comes up.
Does the journalistic community realize that this process directly contributes to the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not just there)?
Not even 60 years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish swine" and similar oppressiveness, it became hard on me.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, the Slavs were destined to be destroyed?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as "the watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to destroy the Czech nation and delete the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live on the territory of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go among their own, like Gaza, answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security, and top health care (I saw myself in the top private hospital Hadassa, which is funded by sponsoring gifts of Jews from all over the world, often even Arabs go and are naturally treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled area, is to rid Hamas of it and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Inform about Hamas's practices, its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform that in nine years' time, the Gazan government could have flourished with humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which the administrators of Gaza do not pay and even get upset that at this time sometimes the power supplies are cut off.
Had Hamas not invested money in building underground tunnels so that suicide bombers could penetrate Israel’s territory, but perhaps building housing, hospitals, and schools, his Arab brothers in Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon buys for $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed the claim of Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement caused a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google seemed certain for a billion dollars, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago by Justin.tv, was on the verge of becoming a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online games to it - in the words of Business Insider “YouTube for live broadcast gaming”.
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube are already popular videos "Let's Play", a kind where the wise men (mostly older) give the games the processing of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes to a lot when you describeTwitche, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch didn't get anyone too excited, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is the statement by CEO Twitch Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our society, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us achieve it faster.”
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who claim that they prefer to do sports rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about playing instead of actually playing just watching.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder play Resident Evil at 3:00 in the morning, and it's another thing to watch a stranger get 20 hits in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games, in which Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time complete the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone isn't a master of acting or humor, his Twitch channel probably won't be very interesting.
But what do they know about this skeptic like me?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth on top of Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to use this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that any company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As director Twitche Shear, Amazon, and Twitch said, "believes in the future of games," and the media does not seem reluctant, even as a swallow, to viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on "Holy Scriptures are God's word."
Attached to the original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things contrary to their religion, they often put us before the question: Who will you trust?
The supposed word of God or the word of man?
It's as if human exploration were completely inconsequential in comparison to the authority they imagine has their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to the word of God, they refer to the myths of God written down by people.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator with a purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be he who supplied the other series of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And it was people who wrote all those lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really were one true god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture.
It would be known anywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure themselves with such a work.
And people might not blindly trust her because she would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to share a common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, and they are all constantly falling apart into increasingly separate denominations, searching for contentious truths, and each one somehow claims divine guidance, regardless of the ongoing divergence and separation in every direction.
Jewish Torah, Christian Gospels, Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'llah's Kitab-i-Akdás, Zarathushtrovy Avesta, Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabharatska Bhagavad-Gita, Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true God" and the believers of each of them say that the others are in error.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is in a certain degree of error.
None of the above books have any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence support, and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historical accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apology (defensives) because they contain irregularities, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it can't be said that they're evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies - with the fact that each can also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written with human hands and thus are the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and discrepancies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more of a mutual comment.
We must point out once again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author and certainly not an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish between four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five "Moses" books and Moses do not attribute the authorship to any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several interrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
The other documents have been filtered through at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
There is no way the Bible is as old as its believers think.
Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by docéti and ebionics, and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups like the luciferians were disbanded and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these arrangements refers to King Ugarita, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Moses religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock and Ba'al Zebula, "the Lord of the Mount" turned Beelzebub into "the Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently changed for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commissary decisions at the Nikai Assembly.
The four Gospels were accepted, and 16 others were rejected by simply raising their hands as if the reality of a matter could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of that time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter at the Jerusalem Church?
What about in the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found themselves approaching the same evangelical stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the point of view of the primordial church.
So the council simply accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
However, they knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they reported books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items, we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved in this way if God was the real author of this random mix of legends, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by humans and certainly not by much enlightenment, rather the opposite!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, no matter what it is from beginning to end.
We talk about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, bewitched objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to put blood on someone, it would cure them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants, and bats are birds, and whales are fish, and pi is a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they'd give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen of truly superior beings and was intended to be a literal history, then it would not contain anything that it contains at all.
As a moral guide, it completely fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or promoted cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, violence against children, abortion, pillaging, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creationists are still ignoring all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is contrary to the Bible, then reality must be ignored!
Why?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't even have God.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "worshiping creation instead of creator."
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow disproves God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are HIS word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposedly "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited and often deliberately altered and twisted by mere erratic people.

An attacker in a Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of whom died.
A man named Chen, according to the agency, New China violently broke into the primary school building this morning and attacked around half past ten local times.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen then killed himself by jumping from a height, said New China with reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in line with government policy.

Over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, estimated by the Ministry of Education.
The new art director of News News is David Fiala
David Fiala became the new art director of news and publicism of TV Nova since 1 September.
He will replace Alan Záruba, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova group since 1 June.

David Fiala controls very well the synergy of communication between editorial, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the work of art director of news.
He has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the path we want to go further in News News," says creative director Novy Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, naked celebrity images made public
Screenshot with extract of leaked files
So far, an anonymous user on server 4chan publishes both naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, alerted the American server Mashable.com.
Allegedly, he obtained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where the affected users uploaded them via automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't said anything about the problem yet.
Some celebrities reject the images as falsified, but have already admitted several of the images concerned.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played in the Die Hards 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
The footage was reported to have shown interest in American magazines, but according to news server 4chan, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it's probably really a weakness in iCloud security.
In fact, a tool appeared on GitHub two days ago, allowing passwords to be accessed through gross force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool worked demonstrably, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the publication of this tool.
For preventive reasons, iCloud users should change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
Evasive naked photos of celebrities consider it a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt files before upload first.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic photo backup from your phone so that it only takes place on Wi-Fi and when connected to the charger.
So you will be able to move the sensitive images to safety in time, and above all, you will have space to delete the wrong images, so they will not unnecessarily occupy space in the online repository.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet to readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
Smart way to save on college scripts
Since the cost of university scripts for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the second year’s upcoming student came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He invented a system of lending books from senior classmates offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“I won a book of calculations that normally costs $180 for the semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19 who studies at Covenant College, Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different ways of coping with these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is to become online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the book for a semester, often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 bookstores in campuses, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in response shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Shops, less than half of the teaching texts are purchased at university bookstores.
Here's 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than at the university bookstore.
The recommended award for the ninth edition of the book “Calculus” by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but on the Internet it can be purchased at Chegg.com, a retail book specialist, for a new one for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind other people's remarks or wear and tear, teaching texts are a good option.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid 42 cents for a used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business”.
The new one was sold for $48.
The university teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working in seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold at a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Lending
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and you do not need them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about $20 for the whole semester.
Meet the terms of the store in which you borrow your book, including the penalty for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to obtain an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic license valid for some time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for approximately 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, students of literary courses can find the best offers because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends that you follow ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order your book online, make sure it's really in stock, advises Gault.
He made sure of it himself.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found the torso rifles from the end of the war in the well.
The well is just outside St. George's Church.
We uncovered the vegetation around us and started to pull out an old load - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clayy day, we hit the barrel," Radomil Novák described.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it was the torso of an attack German rifle used by SS units.
The findings are said to be unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were made until the end of the war.
And there were about 300,000 of them," added Novák.
All the wooden constructions have broken down over time, which is why it's useless.
Her body, of course, is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was dumped by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by the SS units, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing guns in the woods," thinks the finder.
The rifle was the only thing the Rainbow Jeseník Movement enthusiasts found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of hand grenades around here, so we slowed down the excavation work, carefully felting the mud so that there was no misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," said Novák.
The discovery will end in the depository of the museum at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
Exclusive interview Aktuálně.cz with General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take this... I have been called from Donetsk," he apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz, Ukrainian colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Centre for the Liberation of Prisoners.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in the TV debate.
At any such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban is specifying with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That will be it - go there," concluded one of the flash discussions with Donetsk and again devoted to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a backup general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests at Majdan.
Yesterday - when we arranged an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is dedicated to 24 hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that Czechs are fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their numbers within 30.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not Czechs yet.
But I do know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured countryman and could free him.
A Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise Czechs to join the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists capture them, they will shoot them without mercy after questioning, just like any other foreigner.
The Separatists consider these men to be hired by mercenaries, and they claim they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them, for example, a Czech - they put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
This guy's just gonna survive.
Even in war, the Ukrainian side behaves like a state.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, it's in exchange.
Some sources say it's long past a hundred men.
We've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we only freed them... from the war they didn't save if they decided to keep fighting.
Rescuers are doctors at war, surgeons, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day there's more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release prisoners, even a simple human request.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority with the pro-Russian separatists and even trust... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both sides of the war?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "Crazy General with Steel Balls".
I'm not offended.
And maybe that describes the nature of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers' Corps, I've gained some authority before.
I never get smart, cheat, and keep my word.
No matter what, I'm honest and telling the truth.
Even if it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk government, very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I've often risked my life, even captured in the exchange of prisoners... this job could mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures do you know about?
The Ukrainians and the Separatists resort to torture prisoners in interrogation.
Unfortunately.
And the executions?
They only happen on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
No sign of the Ukrainian army committing anything like this.
We have an idea of the amount of executions, but I can't give the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but there are also veterans from Afghanistan.
They seek independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that is what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opposers - to the death.
As we say, they've eaten up to their throats.
The same dreams and desires were expressed on Maidan, by the way.
And now I'm doing a little bit of research: Russia supports separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other to be small.
This sentence of mine already has an irreconcilable contradiction in it.
A.cz: For example, how do you find one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I'm unarmed and show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of that 200 or 300 meters in a shot or in an optical sighting.
I can always see the faces of the people pointing at me... and they can pull the trigger of their guns at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if it is, it's just like a little gubernia in a big Russian empire.
In any case, he constantly talks about it and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
He doesn't even think there should be a state like that.
At the same time, he is an irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters, in the Ukrainian television discussion show, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Jacenuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
I get scared at least five times in that 300-metre walk.
Why, then, should I hide the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a stake in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Jaceňuk a "king".
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians that would be feared or have respect and authority in others.
His behavior directly replicates rabbit behavior.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he has no right in war to cry in parliament, to beg him, to play his scheme with him, to threaten to give up his office... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in times of war.
When a country is threatened, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest on weeping emotions.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Jaceòuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he was never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
He should leave, therefore.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save Sales
The expendable 3 Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the US $90 million budget, and Sin City: A woman for whom I would return only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14,6 million during the first weekend, and also movies for kids like How to Train Dragon 2 was a disappointment to cinemas.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in Telegraph, as far as children's films are concerned, their own quality is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films, and he called the Dragon 2 a mere "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem is not necessarily in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average evaluation of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Day of the Victim of the War and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in audience access and higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney jungle book processing, said the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it, and we don't try to chase after what's already been done.
Unlike the current Hollywood blockbuster crisis, Netflix’s profit was $1.2 billion thanks to Internet services, almost twice as much as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted "breakdown" Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there may be something about his catastrophic prophecy.
With the introduction of possible big box office blockbusters in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimon and Jurassic world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
The producer of X-Men Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply "cyclic." For Hollywood Reporter, he said, "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest box office blockbusters in history and no one will worry about selling."
DPRK again threatening Seoul, launched another short-range missile
North Korea launched another short-range missile into the sea, announced Seoul.
The alleged rocket test took place shortly after the end of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as preparing for the invasion.
Čagang Province is located in the northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
According to the DPA agency, a South Korean Defense Department spokesman reported that the missiles were fired from a location in the north-west of the DPRK and reached a distance of approximately 200 kilometres.
North Korea apparently launched a rocket from Changang Province for the first time, reported South Korean media, referring to military circles.
They say there's an underground launch pad in the province for Scud missiles.
This is another series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea carried out an unusually large number of rocket and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were held by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to participate in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summite.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation during the weekend and spoke to protesters who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be flown from the Blue Mountains
TWO young tourists were picked up by plane and transported to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16 - year - old girl and an 18 - year - old man hiked to the Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday noon.
When they didn't come home, anxious relatives called the police around 8:00 p.m.
A search party was sent, including local police and a rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11:00 p.m.
The girl hurt her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
Cops stayed with them overnight and were picked up Monday morning.
In stable condition, they were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the prize was on the leg of Vasicek
The 23-year-old army could decide, but in two of its best chances, it failed.
After the goal called mainly a close-up shot three minutes before the end, instead of in the net but ended up on goaltender Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, that's the chance I have to give.
I am angry with myself," he poured ashes on his head.
"I probably should have put it higher under the lid, it got a little high," he wondered.
The Defensive Sigma did not allow Opava much, except for Mikul's 11th-minute raid, which however covered the goalie Reichl.
Then the Hanaks began to push, but in the block defending the domestics did not let them go and the shots from a distance caught by May.
We were comparing for 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more out of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But he didn't change the obvious chance of yours, so it ended with 0-0," regretted coach Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava took the point because of absences in the lineup, where apart from a couple of injured, Petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík were missing, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike its former policy, it did not allow them to get on.
The alternates deserve a discharge.
Sigma worked more football, but we did not let her do anything except for one standard," said Slezán coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and combat.
The tie is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma's tied four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the club boss Josef Lébro, who, after defeating Znojmo, made his million-dollar contribution to the cash register a diametrically different performance in other games.
"We were aware of Mr.Lébro's warning, so there can be no talk of boys not wanting to fight," Kalvod noticed and added to the address of sleeping shooter Vášíček: "I believe it will come and when he scores the goal, it will start falling there.
But after the first shot, I will replace him to save his goals for the next games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino's excited Venice twice.
The film festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárrit suddenly became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days gave the impression that interest in the 71st annual festival in Venice fell somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to 14 hundred, or because Birdman has been followed by critics recognized, but for viewers less attractive pictures as a documentary on genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s In view of silence and other social themes films from American 99 homes to Iranian Stories, empty seats have simply remained in the cinemas.
The heroes of comic books
Even the red carpet outside the festival palace has not yet besieged such crowds as in the past, and it is said that it was no longer a problem to get a last-minute seat at the hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that such esteemed institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world have been affected.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but only in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully performed dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, the main event was the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He shined here in two movies.
In the story of the Oscar Barry Levison based on Philip Roth's novel, Pacino has a 45-year-old role close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a strange owner of a hardware store from a rural town in the movie Manglehorn, which David Gordon Green filmed, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for best acting should not miss it - but does the artist Pacin's format still need prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims to the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for the Italians
After all, the Italian film is doing very well this year in Venice.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became Birdman's first picture, rewarded by a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is seen in it by looking at family relationships between clans that fight for both power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all prerequisites for a good film: a good script, a camera, music and actors.
He also captured the chamber psychothriller The Hungry Hearts, who recorded Saverio Costanzo and Alba Rohrwacher as a woman who almost destroys her own child with her misguided anxiety.
On the contrary, French competition films did not receive a warm welcome, nor did the ransom for fame, nor did 3 hearts, both of which cling to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, i.e. Birdman and Black Soul, are not so little for the first half of the festival.
And even though festival films have mostly depressing themes, a new Peter Bogdanovich film called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy set out in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American fun games of the 1940s, has managed to lift the mood for more than one day.
The police caught four meth producers in Prague, the drugs were delivered from Poland
"The detectives have arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 in recent days and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold meth in Prague 9 from November to August of last year," said police spokesperson Jana Rösslerová.
First on Tuesday, August 12, the task force on Brickwork Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was a drug buyer in Poland and a dose dealer.
The following day, detectives arrested another member of the group on the basis of the prior consent of the prosecutor, a 37-year-old male.
The last of the four police officers caught him on Wednesday morning, August 20th, in the area of the Malešická incinerator," the spokesperson described.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drugs
The main organizer had a wide field of appeal.
In the workshop of the summer resort, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced meth, provided various supplies and chemicals needed for its production and provided transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
Further manufactured drug weighed, divided into plastic bags and subsequently sold meth.
He was helped by a 25 - year - old, yet unpunished woman, with the transportation of drugs from Poland or the sale of narcotics.
For this she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the manufactured drugs," Rösslerová added.
Criminalists also carried out several home searches on the basis of the judge’s orders, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, hoses and other items, which according to experts can be considered complete equipment for methamphetamine production.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"The police then found out from the available records that the main organizer had been sentenced seven times since 1995 for property crimes, the woman was not convicted," the police spokesperson added.
The last detainee was convicted of statutory rape in 2006 and a 37-year-old car mechanic who has been prosecuted at large has been convicted nine times since 2009.
Even for him, it was mostly for property crimes.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other dealings with narcotics and psychotropic substances and poisons, which threaten up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator gave the prosecutor a motion to impose custody, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, 37-year-old recidivist, went free.
His position and role in this case were not as fundamental as that of the other defendants.
The police continue to work with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at a lot of "interesting" prices.
For example, handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm board will serve as a good example in Italy.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer receives a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibres.
It may not be surprising that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rising horse at their disposal.
If you do not find chess as a sufficiently valuable gift, you also need a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course by hand) in scale 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Interrupting high school and high school makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few general educated people and statistics show that the gymnasts have good applications.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
It's mostly routine stuff, like transferring pots from the summer storage back to classes and getting chalk.
They're gonna be a little busy at the mustard high school.
A few days before the beginning of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment as well as library literature.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year gymnasium in Hořice opens and renews its activities after three years.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founding fathers being so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering into the register of schools administered by the Ministry of Education.
"The French Socialists should shut up and fix France," said Francois Holland's key ally
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to "show its support" to the wary socialist president, whose new division of functions has not met with the approval of the majority of the French.
The President deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said, giving us a round of applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French 35 - hour working week, despite heated speculation by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister who suggested that the rules should be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday Hollande asked the socialists to stay "cohesive" with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the Minister of Justice, drew a line across his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist MPs, where the Socialist Party criticized the French for losing faith in the future because of her.
Marine Le Pen, leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal dispute between socialists when she said that she did not expect the new Valls government to last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and Prince Manuel Valls, too, were forced to build a new government when the previous one didn't last until the end of summer.
"And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter," said Le Penová to her supporters.
It reiterated its party's call to dissolve Parliament and stated that it was convinced that it could win the party early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche weekly, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of being divided into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes are taking place in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, things could get even worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague until the election
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved only by the new management of the capital.
Other gambling rooms will not disappear from the streets of Prague before municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
Even walking dogs will not be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees by October elections.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current management of the city, which ends in a few weeks' mandate," said Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Over the past weeks several city councils, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel the gambling on their territory.
The gambling rooms won't go away, the gambling decree won't change yet.
It's the task of the city's new leadership after the election.
Now we would not have technically made it due, for example, to the deadlines for commenting and so on," explained Manhart.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment of the Order, will take place on 11 September.
On the day of the municipal elections, Prague 1 and Prague 8 prepare a report on a comprehensive ban on gambling.
There is currently a ban on gambling in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, so-called busting.
Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal to the Magistrate, complains about this, which the current list of prohibited places would like to expand.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the surroundings of Anděl.
The decree regulating walking dogs city is preparing for several months, not yet completed.
The location of the rooms and the issue of busking is solved by city decrees.
Only the representative of the capital may issue them or modify them.
City Halls only have an advisory vote, they cannot issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed victory at the hands of the proponents of Scottish independence
The Scottish Independence Campaign was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost put the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich on billboards all over Scotland.
But you can't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, or earn their respect if you threaten them.
The morale of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots tend to drive money changers out of the temple rather than let them dictate how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists, Alex Salmond, knows this well, so in the TV debate he repeatedly asked his opponent, the Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the "superior will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between Scotland's civil society and London's financiers, and with the grimace, he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling won't support the mandate of the Scottish voters.
However, the discussion of Scotland’s currency was more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defense of state health, which citizens have for free.
Darling supported London’s bankers in terms of currency, and he also gave the impression that he would not protest the privatisation of health care.
By the way Salmond said it, he got into bed with the conservatives.
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the association of "boss", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It's becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee landlord.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be a successful independent country.
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's causing him almost physical pain.
What he tells is clear: Scots do not jump and have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic beginning of school according to Miloš Urban
Illustration to the Tale Longest Year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that was no longer going anywhere, and we were just lying around with our granny summers, the quiet before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading Fast Arrows, for the fiftyth time, the whistling of the mountain around Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun stroked its back and shoulders, knocking the rays off.
A night of mild nervousness, still vacation mode, sleep at half past seven, it gets worse in a week, the moment before falling asleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, and then wake up at 6:30 in the morning.
Monday's coming.
It usually doesn't rain, on the contrary, summer sneers maliciously in front of school.
To come up in a ghostly light on the slab and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there's this school, ZDŠA A.
Potock with a giant pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a couple of new ones, boys pulled out, girls bustier.
There's bad guys over there, avoiding them, it's interesting how unmistakably they stick together and how soon they're here.
And these grown-up girls who came in jinxed, now they're laughing hysterically at something, probably something's changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything's the same with me.
And new freshmen, some nervous and others excited, why are they even coming here?
Because they have to, the educational army mandatory.
So inside, the cool humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately, still the same one that will lend the student the key from the tin box, where you can leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room stays in memory, it's not happening now, it's well ventilated, but it's going to get worse in a week.
It's just the vision that makes the stomach hold and the head starts to hurt.
The head that holds the math class even worse, the evil play for the chosen, which I do not belong to, and I will never be.
Threes and fours again, God forbid fives, hide from rehearsals, fit in the bench, and best off, be there and not be, only exist as a classroom name, and dream stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, antennas into space, where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone, and doesn't undermine anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She's facing an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first delivery took place in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without help, she was born a little girl, who after cutting the umbilical cord she wrapped in a prepared blanket, hid under her jacket and carried it to a road passer, where she put it in bushes located several tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school
I guess it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I needed to go to the bathroom, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors that I wore to school," the defendant described and said that she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The following day, she returned to the place, put the body of the child in her backpack and took the body out of her backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkov Brod," she said in the lawsuit, saying that it was not quite obvious when the newborn died.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also several hours after birth, asphyxiation when covered with a blanket or when inserted under a jacket, hypothermia or exsanguination from an unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
A woman from February to April 12, when a corpse of a child was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, gave birth in secret.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family house.
Without verifying whether she was born alive, without cutting and tying the cord that was wrapped around her neck, she placed the child in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Later in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
For this reason too, he is not currently in court, he was only punished for a crime against the undertaker's law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accessory.
He manipulated the baby against my wishes.
I know that my solution was wrong, but it felt human at the time," the indignation of the defendant, who allegedly succumbed to and feared the man in her relationship, was not hidden.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly balancedly.
Tears brought her to her eyes only when she talked about her relationship with her parents, who she left after reaching her age.
She said she didn't want to kill.
"They come to visit me every 14 days, do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't get my kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in the babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do.
I can't explain it to you," she answered the judge.
However, she refused to act with reason and intent to kill the newborn.
The second child was also, according to her claim, born dead.
She didn't stop drinking alcohol when she was pregnant.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also reduced smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed that she had health problems, that she was watered.
And so is my friend.
The main trial will continue at the Castle Court on Tuesday with the testimony of the forensic experts.
A verdict could be handed down on Wednesday.
A woman is at risk for up to 18 years in prison, or even exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching the three-billion-dollar buyout of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest cruise operator in the world, has advanced in negotiations to purchase Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately three billion dollars.
The business by Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, which competes with the greater competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N.) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N.), allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and wealthy clients.
The agreement can already be published this week, revealed the source on Sunday, but pointed out that the negotiations still do not have to end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in the Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be appointed because the negotiations were not public.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the comment request, Apollo spokeswoman refused to comment on the situation.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s income in 2013 was $2,57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa, and South America.
In 2013, the company announced revenues of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
The 29 billion cruise segment is expected to profit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public tender with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the conclusion of a deal worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when a merger took place with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure companies and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise introduced shares on the stock market in January 2013.
According to registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June Genting held 28 %, Apollo 20 % and TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documentation of the first public offer, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise comprise 82% of North American passengers.
Prodemocrat activists in Hong Kong provoking the Chinese authorities the day after the vote
A group of people loyal to Beijing, waving the Chinese flag, stood nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Commission of the National People's Congress approved only two of the three candidates to participate in the elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointment committee, which will probably consist of members of loyal Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballots and force pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and cripple the financial center of Hong Kong with the protests of the “Occupation of the Centre” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, and Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on China’s official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city’s business district.
The government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong are organising a press conference at which Prime Minister Li will speak.
During the day, Vice-President Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were to speak at several press conferences.
The student activists said that they would gather outside the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately open negotiations on “state sovereignty” of the detached areas.
His spokesman Dmitri Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that eastern Ukraine areas under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered so that the Russian-speaking area would be given authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian insurgents as equals corresponds to an obvious strategy that has followed since the riots broke out five months ago: Help separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novoruska factual independence so that instead of the West, he can join Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were dominated by separatists after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists of the recently occupied territory called “Novorus” or “New Russia”, a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin’s words that “prison illusion” is everyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns before the parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government troops attack civilians in areas dominated by separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of the state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of a broader autonomy, which has been discussed with the leadership of Kiev for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian speaking areas about the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin spokesman, which was to correct Putin's “wrong interpretation” of Putin's remarks, highlighted Russia's leadership approach to resolving the separatist uprising in the East, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two-million-dollar population are native to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty aecting Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls that took place before the conflict showed broad support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin effective control of the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the seat of the main Russian naval fleet, maritime business facilities and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries, which produce important components for the Russian army.
During his June 7 inauguration speech, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and the Separatists. Moscow is accused of armament and incitement of violence.
Putin’s last call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals followed by further action by insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks from the previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea penetrated Eastern Ukraine.
The Separatists strengthened the Russians by taking control of Novoazovsk so much that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This has accelerated the huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinates of 500,000 inhabitants between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko appeared at the meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching the point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilvaysk after last week two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military troops had infiltrated the Donetsk region to support besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilvaysk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, said Lysenko on Sunday.
Australia's celebrities and Gabi Grecko are involved in the scandal with the photos exposed.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted on the Internet in the biggest celebrity photo-hacked scandal.
Hacker claims that he has 60 photos with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Because of the leak from iCloud, personal images of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko were reportedly made public.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting. ”
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, reported that online news reports that hacking is “ shameless” and those who have become its target “feel humiliated.”
It's believed that the hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with Scott Speedman's ex-boyfriend, including two pictures that he's rolling on top of the pool.
Palmer, for example, performed in Love and Honor, where Liam Hemsworth was her counterpart.
Palmer, the star of Chuck Strahovski's TV series and the thriller actress Sucker Punch Browning didn't comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter: “Publicing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
Legally speaking, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy footballers made up for Lebra, even without winning
Olomouc - Thunders and lightning, which co-owner of Olomouc Sigmy Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be the past.
Even though Opava brought only a point for a defenseless draw.
After all, they made up a little bit with the club boss by putting on and fighting.
Payday money could come to the club soon.
"I'll keep one more game, as I talked about last week, but I'm already much more optimistic," said Lebr, saying that despite Sigma's failure to win, players convinced him with improved performance.
The fight and commitment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive him not to win.
If we had played this way since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," he thinks.
Sigma in Opava survived the initial pressure of the home, then settled the game and in the second half it was better.
After the victory Kalvoda’s wards reached out, but their options did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not our idea.
To complete satisfaction, we lacked only one transformed chance," said Lebr, who does not think that the change in the approach of football players caused only his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from my coach or from my fans," said Lebr.
Sigma must count on the pressure
After the Opava event last week, the players were not very interested in commenting.
I'm trying to put these things away.
I tried not to admit it," Michal Reichl, the young goaltender, rolled his head.
Without comment, the question about Lebrov's statement from last week was left by the attacker Václav Vášíček, who did not change Sigmy's greatest opportunity in Saturday's match.
Eventually, however, a little bit of pressure was discussed.
We'll always be under pressure.
Everybody wants to come at us.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride everybody's ass, we'll do it," he said.
They took the warning to heart
Even Coach Leoš Kalvoda did not pretend that preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that Mr. Lebro's warning was taken to heart.
Even before, it wasn't that they didn't want to fight and screw it up," said Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to get over the hard stuff and realize what the other league was all about.
That it is not just about football, but mainly about fighting," Kalvoda said.
All we have to do is hope that in the next fight, that Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I would love to believe that," he added.
