Republican Party Strategy Against Obama’s Reelection
Republican leaders have justified their policy by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
But Brennan’s center calls such fraud a myth that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
After all, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US over the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states are responsible for organising federal elections in the US.
And in this spirit, since 2009, most American governments have been declaring new laws that make the election process difficult or difficult to register on the electoral list.
This phenomenon has seen a boom following the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states have increased.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted only in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present photo ID and evidence of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the periods for early elections, invalidate the right to register as voters on the day of the elections, and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state required to present a photo ID to voters.
Indiana was the first state to implement this request.
The constitutionality of the Indian law was confirmed in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this process to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of the age allowed to vote, do not own any photo ID issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have such an identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the purchase of the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions mainly affect young, minority and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% income under $35,000; 18% citizens over 65 and 20% voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not therefore have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their propensity to democratic candidates are not entitled to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs, who choose rather Republican candidates, to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required citizenship evidence for elections.
Arizona introduced the first such request.
Since 2011, some 12 states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic party.
In 2011, Republican legislatures supported laws in eight states that cancel voter registration on election day.
Moreover, they have limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to sign in.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, campaigns to register voters helped to register about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% decline in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican legislators then passed laws in the other five states aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, African-Americans accounted for 33% of the voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, white people, who represented 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have taken a very strong stand against the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
In part, they managed to reduce the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have adopted laws requiring the submission of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will make it quite undeniably difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics speak above all about the bias of approved laws and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report by the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral corps necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: pass the exam or not?
The PSA test has sometimes yielded false results that were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitantness of men who were already so reluctant to go for an examination.
Get yourself checked out or not?
We've asked two experts for an opinion.
Studies conducted in the USA showed a high degree of contamination between the individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, noted a different mortality rate between patients who had been examined and those who had not been examined.
This study also showed, after a 12-year distance, that those who do not pass the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
I therefore recommend an examination from 50 years of age or 40 years of age if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is exposed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to explain correctly to the patient the level of risk of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which has no impact on life in the long term, and to focus on active disease surveillance in these cases.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not cured because their type of cancer is not aggressive and is not life-threatening.
Rather, we suggest that they exercise active supervision and offer treatment in case of disease progression.
More and more often and with greater precision, we set criteria that help to decide which species to treat and which does not.
Still, I recommend that you take the exam.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool to evaluate for and against the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the best way to reduce disease risk is to adopt the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided if everyone ate healthy and moved sufficiently.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Society for Cancer Research.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes inheritance.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for Canada’s cancer research society, even if the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely damaging to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says André Beaulieu.
Encouragement: 10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of death to cancer is halved.
Weight
Body weight and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
Too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," adds the report.
Vitamins
Recently, different scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
According to the SCC, studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory.
Although one of them believes that the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study speaks more about its increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu further insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and precedents with his doctor.
"Submitted to the examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And it's the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that this is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all data is still missing so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, let us assume that this is the Higgs boson, since the risks of error appear to be small, and let us look at what this is all about.
In this world, there is an unquestionable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quant state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
Next, they divide the physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find decent citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow Pauli’s principle.
And at the other end, there are bosons, mean anarchists, who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley's laboratories: the mesons that we leave unnoticed, and the "force particles" that spread large natural forces and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
It must be said, however, that these bosons are not as exotic animals as they might be thought.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or a "part of light", which is a "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When the particles with the electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they "interrupt" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into the pond.
This "interruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "power carriers".
More stable fields
It's also with the Higgs boson, only with the difference that "interrupt" requires a different field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it is necessary to achieve very high energy values to excitation, as with the frozen pond surface, only a very large boulder will pick up.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with friendly bundles is a circle with a circuit of 27 km! - in order to be able to develop such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, such as magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the fridge.
And yet, with the Higgs field, all particles do not react: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as photon, let's look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what are all these researches for, what are they going to "bring us"?
In terms of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between observations and forecasts of SM.
Moreover, few physicists literally wish that they could be found, because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, it does not bring any explanation of gravity (wort!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the space mass (wort!).
However, CERN has not yet found such contradictions.
Responses
The responses of these researches in Mr Novak's daily life can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Behold: at the very beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell's laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said it - the laser was initially considered such a "toy for the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, all instruments surrounding research can also be applied.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and has won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life...
Through his Commission for Dignified Dying, Quebek recently became involved in a delicate end-of-life issue.
The debate should continue shortly, and the bill is being drafted at the same time.
There is still much work to be done in this fundamental area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to take a closer look at this question.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, granted him a two - year delay.
"They gave me five years of my life and it's already seven," he says, without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: an immense weakness makes it impossible for it to go to the toilet itself or just to eat itself.
Resigned, he looks at a tasty - looking breakfast, and he agrees that we will help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, bring him medication, offer him a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In all life you learn that men urinate standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the child’s stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the man", if he accepts the return, says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people dealing with palliative care, fundamental moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients entering a home with palliative care, Victor-Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is at most three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them do not provide them with so-called "healing" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "suffocation in full consciousness".
The disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says, and then she allows us to put her breathing apparatus on.
Yet he is still looking forward to his last visit to his son from Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
That's what palliative care looks like when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all gonna die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
For example, when a person dies, he can be given a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetic patients no longer need to monitor their blood sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life here.
Last night, they were carrying a beer to Mr. X, who died later last night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savardová, director of nursing services.
In Victor-Gadbois' home, days go by days, but they don't look like each other.
In addition to the 39 - year - old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family well - founded on pillows while toasting him in his honor, a tragically 36 - year - old man surrounded by his parents, wife, and two young children dies after trying out all the opportunities to survive.
"For six months there are always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel, concerned.
53% of the patients who come to home Victor-Gadbois come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the sick reach the final stage of their lives, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental unavailability of healthcare in Quebec that causes a number of doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been in circulation, signed by peaks in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the quebe medical system is not powerful enough to provide access for all persons to high-quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency room in great pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
They are concerned that patients should not be asked to be killed because they are not adequately cared for.
At the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of adverse prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she left the difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their treating physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative cunt team eased their pain.
It must be said, though, that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care in the Society for Home Palliative Care of Grand Montréal, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether in shock or whether given permanently.
We can't pretend to ignore this part of the suffering.
A patient we can't relieve of pain will still have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
Sick people who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia", it means "I want you to relieve my pain."
A grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research enabled the implementation of this report.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists and experts in the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are blended.
This "creation" came very dear to the Quebek taxpayers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has dissipated since we have taken major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebek MP and former chief of police in Montreal, ironically.
Thanks to him, the scandal broke out in 2011 on the basis of a rigorous investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which were approved by the then liberalquebek Prime Minister Jean Charest after long delays.
"Duchesneau's report" confirmed the direct link between industry, the opaque financing of the parties and the corruption of civil servants.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport has saved billions of dollars in contracts," when some people have kept their instincts in check to gain a share in them!
Charbonneau's commission "has already brought two mayors to their resignation," adds with the hope that it will be able to "discover the deceitfulness of some people".
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption Established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit set up in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau Association", who since 2009 have made sure that the Montreal "money pipelines card" significantly mitigates the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of tours and charged fraud and corruption with a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a village in the suburbs.
The next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He's suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The formal accusations have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
Lino Zambia caused a sensation by explaining to the Commission the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
During these years, he himself gave 3% of the value of the orders he received in Montréal to an intermediary connected with the mafia, who then transferred the money to Union Montréal, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambia was generous to all parties after 2000 and devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68 000 euro) to provincial parties, but especially to liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising illegal fundraising for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normanddeau.
Contracts with cash pipelines whose prices were higher
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surfrenant, a former transport engineer, described him very closely before the commission: during ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches, and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with cash pipelines, where he was putting the prize.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had paid remuneration for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through untrue extrapolations.
The mayor’s party’s organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of condescending his eyes on the parallel budget that brought dirty money to his cash register.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned early in November, throwing Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Priries district in the east of the island, since 2010, she has been arguing against the sale of a local property purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of the money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be initiated, says that "he pulls the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of an ant-infested system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
According to her, the process is "painful but positive".
We are in a phase of wound cleaning, but we need to set up our own investigation unit in Montréal and ensure that these questionable practices cannot be brought back.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "employees informed of this trick" if they have not gotten involved in these scams!
He estimates that 70% of campaign funding in Quebec comes from dirty money, and he adds with irony: "I hear it's just a weak deterrence of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to the parties to $100, but he says that this will not solve the situation: 'Until the election spending is strictly limited, the dirty money from politics will not disappear.'
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: 'We can't go any lower; if we boldly focus on the substance of things, we can build again on firmer foundations and with greater control and compliance.'
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who mocks him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went together, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
Every day, I get further along with them.
The tech team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier when you fight.
Everything's going so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the prep school in INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I've always moved on to different stages.
So you're taking advantage of the competitive environment Carlo Ancelotti has introduced...
Reinforcements from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makele, who used to play the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, in the 1st league, he has no equal and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our leading position.
But we're staying on the hook.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: very easily we have advanced to the eight-finals.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Port first so we can play in a rematch of the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget's already got it...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, the PSG has the means to make this plan happen.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We've been missing a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had the strength to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think we're gonna make it this year.
Although large teams like Marseille, Lyon, and Bordeaux are also seeking the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us given what's been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troys 4-0 at home and there's still something in the papers that blames us, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what more people want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
At the Champions League, we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't fought for the eight-finals in season two, yet they've invested a lot of money!
Given the invested sums, you'd be expected to have a head start over the other 15 points!
That insults other clubs and the French League.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not do very well last season, moved on to the next stage with the new PSG.
That shows how amazing the First League is.
I hope that we will be able to smile in May and say that despite all our difficulties, we have succeeded in winning.
PSG seems to rely on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimovich in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's a "dependence on Zlatan."
This means that Ibrahimovich is very powerful and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here, proving he's a league star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both man and player.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has accomplished is truly extraordinary.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with your French representation?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as well as I'd imagined.
But I've been there, and I've come out stronger.
Today I also manage to play good matches in the representation.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the representation.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you feel about the first months of Didier Deschamps leading the national team?
The results speak for him.
We're in a good place to qualify for MS.
Coach picks hard, he's close to the players and he's excited to win.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the tie (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never seen such a struggle in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true in these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system based on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satosh Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin rate first reached a maximum of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $2, today it is on the border of about $10 (the course overview is shown on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's not impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
Bitcoin calls "the most successful virtual money", "competitive dollar and euro" and "a period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being like "credits" used to advance in a video game that can be acquired by a game or bought (and sometimes exchanged back).
Facebook's social network also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all network nodes are depositories of the current account book, controllers, money issuers and buyers as well as sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of current accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is a stage of file cutting; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they "cut" the whole.
The aim is to find a number that provides a specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructibly displayed connected to the string of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user wanted to pay double of the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of both transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited by 21 million, but it can be divided into 100 millionths, so there is room for margin...
The difficulty of the given task also increases with increasing level of calculation.
The network has seen its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used loophole does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibilities for money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like a WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the current account book and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins are not running.
In November, "big discounts" were launched.
"The $30,000 has been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to transform bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or non-contact cell phone payment, but uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which makes it cheaper.
Moreover, the wearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set for traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and identified" by the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and to move towards more horizontal systems.
"It will be a while before Bitcoin succeeds, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB expects a reassessment of the various risks considered to be increased today if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside that we punished suffered the greatest harm because we considered them terrorists.
And so do we. We lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and maimed.
Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks joined them.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French troops from the basics of Nijarab, which I followed from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, went smoothly.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by helicopters.
The Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The conditions have changed considerably since their unstoppable course of action between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, which completely dominated the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former mujahedins, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
Major dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state property, which they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them were never in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that won't be made up of thieves.
A number of young people want to leave just as those who have been able to use American generosity will leave: capital leakage is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and the ideologies associated with it.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world and were intrigued by its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; 5 million people currently live in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
There are public schools in the cities, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to be given a job, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes cell phones; TV and Turkish TV shows the modern world, watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that take her lead be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization in the form of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so that the post of prime minister, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam works, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced but fruit and vegetables.
The priority is a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral assets.
And it just made the feeling that the Western states were only here to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper in place and without resources to transport raw materials through mountains, however, no mineral extraction can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mine Mes Aynak and have left international archeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area in order to retain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common forms of assistance: girls and boys lycea, French departments at universities, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, there has been an initiative to "get your heart and soul" attempting to reconcile aid and military activities, which then served the "civil-arms action" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but has achieved many achievements in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a small French non-governmental organisation.
These work involving a number of local workers helped dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of the workable area.
What memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, often located above 2,000 m above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in Cape Rica.
In order to free these farmers from the uprisings led by foreign groups, they wish, in their words, to achieve a slight civil aid to their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Difficult Work at the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Morsi embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the constitution, which temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of everyone else, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly two more months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal speculation.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country’s diversity.
From the opposition's point of view, the President remains in his 'autocrat delirium', continues to 'broke his word' and 'stamp the law'.
However, its supporters assure that it is a means of turning the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the purpose of explaining the article to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is wreaking havoc.
As he confirmed in an interview for the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organised vote puts the Egyptian people in front of the ultimatum: 'You will either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers', which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new constitution.
And in this particular climate yesterday, 85 Members of the said Constitutional Assembly approved the text with a large majority of Islamists.
Most liberals were absent in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was announced, they slammed the door saying they didn't have a chance to assert their views.
The defenders of human rights, civil society, or members of religious minorities imitated their actions.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 alternates were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to consider that one of the few disputes revolved around that day... an hour for prayer, when some members of the committee felt that the hours in the meeting room were not properly adjusted.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains identical to the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the Sharia Law principles are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term 'principles' with the term 'rules', which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Physicism," the liberals object, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role on the University of Al-Azhar, in particular on matters of compliance with Sharia law.
According to the expert on Egypt, Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, because "persons called to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can be seen as the beginnings of theocracy".
The fear of liberals is even more fueled by the fact that the next president of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulamians, but university workers, many of whom have studied in French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who prepares work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, note red.]
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to be able to comment on this."
Yesterday's approved text is, in addition to the religious pages, highly criticized because of the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction against the former regime.
Another disputed place: the powers vested in the army.
In accordance with the wishes of military officials, verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, proceedings with civilians will not be banned in military courts, as the Human Rights Association has requested.
These associations are talking about their doubts in relation to the text that they believe is directed against freedom.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is still banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In its view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
That word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the president of Egypt was scheduled to perform in a television speech last night, manifestations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then show up on Saturday.
In Israel waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, belly of the world and sea from saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the integrity of nature.
AaF identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To bow to holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God’s mercy will descend upon all those who enter this “bath. ”
And Galilee - instead of Jesus' wonders: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here will pass through the Path of Pain, or Jesus ’ Cross Path (Via Dolorosa in Latin).
It begins at the Fort Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's Grave on Mount Golgota - to the place of crucifixion, the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian belly of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made the cross for Jesus ’ crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the wall of wailing, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different religions leave notes with wishes which will then be fulfilled.
Make your way to the vertical
The ruins of Masada’s fortress remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach it by their own means.
The others will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the bottom of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived at the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Arts in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition his canvases are widely represented by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Bash museum-bath, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish spa with mannequins of spa users and spa caregivers from that time.
In Caesarea is worth visiting the unique private museum Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guidebooks or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - The Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vash, in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and you find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are glistening.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are spoken.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
The three main resorts of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea can also be bathed in winter months, because the water temperature in it does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
By the way, the dead sea is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest land point of the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
Cyan water is a saturated salt solution that can easily keep people on the surface who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo treatment using saltwater - saltwater, and healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure your nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous maritime route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatoli, and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
Indeed, the tourists love to wander through narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you press your mark on the walls in the alley, happiness will favor you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds coming here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word.
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the Russian population is speaking in this country.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now $1 is approximately 3.8 shekels).
Buses are mainly urban transport, but there is a express tram in Jerusalem, and Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cableway.
Travelling by all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can transfer 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, work on marketplaces, shops and public transport stops.
And Sunday morning starts work week.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only kosher meals are available: except pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish mashed hummus, various kinds of sauces, ground chickpea balls - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel’s cities.
However, there are very many fat cats who are "wandering according to their taste" in grace.
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The forward cats love crowded places and they like to go into every goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To get to know the country and relax came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited from January to October 2012 at 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before visa cancellation on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language testing, frauds have already appeared in the country selling "forgery" certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, according to which each working migrant would be obliged to pass an examination of Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, residential and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, trials will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also have to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is also not subject to people who successfully achieved certification and obtained an academic diploma in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, convictions and protection of rights
The network of test posts will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass exams in all cities; already more than 160 such centres are open in Russia.
Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services) supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask many times in the press the question: what does it really mean?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration service - will be able to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labor."
Many people are talking today about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains President of the FMS Board of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment system will allow 90% of foreign workers to solve their problems.
Problems arise in jobless immigrants, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with conviction Sebelev - a future immigrant is sentenced to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, provide a "injunction" to terrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their country they promise them one thing, but after arrival they will cheat them, impound their passports, do not pay their promised wages," confirms the head of the Tajik Labour Migration Administration MS Tolib Šripov.
Don't swear!
All the less so that many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for work recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as rather their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least an adequate basic education.
After all, their families need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be decently dressed, put on clothes, and equipped for school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, in the light of the law on language testing, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants with legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even take the exams or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally in Russia as before.
"Welcome, or not allowed."
Many of the coming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police employees know that we have basically fake documents, no registration, and that leads to blackmail cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Chuškadamov, shared his experience with journalists.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the law on the language, it was found that not only the registration documents of migrants were false.
The FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the language examination.
The forged documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each migrant paid 7,000 rubles for this document in the hope that it would facilitate the problem of passing the tests.
That is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply purchase documents, in which the government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, the government can promise foreign workers who failed the tests for the first time the necessary time to take a course in the basics of Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not circulate the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
Russia's MVD is proposing to tighten the law in relation to civil arms owners.
It is the reaction of the government to recent events: the trigger was the shootings at weddings without casualties, and the massacre prepared by Moscow’s attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a license to carry weapons can be obtained from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption of Irina Jarovaja, which has promised that amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem through the "screw tightening".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "unsensical tightening up" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, declared Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian BBC editorial.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes from the use of firearms registered by the Ministry of Interior were committed in six months 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed in the same period.
The authors of an open letter are convinced that tightening civil arms legislation will not force the perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
According to their words, any weapon at a low price can currently be found in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says the retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked at the Ministry of Education and General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot pages that accept orders of weapons
The first one - the military or military route, that is, the weapon that was stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and caucasians themselves," Baranec says.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security officials.
Barance explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" get sold from military warehouses.
There are often explosions in many military warehouses.
"It is proven that some fires were set up deliberately - to cover up the manka," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, arms manufacturers also make their contribution.
"Private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market are currently being created, and they are eliminating weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and there is a mafia that organized their smooth production," ex-military explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Design of Public Administration.
Specialists have reviewed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminology literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, reported by researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all the weapons found themselves on the black market "the guilt of officials whose work is associated with weapons," says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons are from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases of weapons being stolen in their production, 5% of them are "black archaeology".
The gun dealer-consultant of one of the arms stores who asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archeologists" are no longer bought - they are simply too old.
Most of the time, as he says, sellers go to military warehouses for new shipments.
He'll buy a unit through the ensign, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, and he sells it to you through the fence.
"He will carry it into town and sell it there for 900 euros per piece with two stacks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well-informed, and so whenever a plan starts to burn in the clarification of criminal offences, they make a check purchase with illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The sellers and the buyer are most often found together through their acquaintances.
I was visiting websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Test" platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the "top" where we'd be negotiating.
The price of the main I learned up there
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows his way out, a salesman tells the story. I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him fully.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivanovich, who asked me to tell my daughter that a tooth had fallen out."
And now I get there through a man I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he processed the state to publish on this topic.
The schematics did not change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album that said "everything you thought of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baranec, is not offered a rabbit in a sack - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller into the woods and we build a target.
"They'll give me a shot, and if I can make sure that the gun shoots well, we're starting to act," the expert says.
Tray on sofa
The search engines will bring you to the web pages and groups on the "Vkontaktu", where it is offered to buy a gun "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"All you have to do is have a fixed amount of money," says the ad headline on the website "Buy a combat pistol or a vending machine".
Users leave their announcements and ask questions on this website.
And selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the copy is preserved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently threw away a huge network of planted websites, and those who wish to buy a military weapon can pick up a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military dignitary Viktor Baranec
I have heard of such schemes:web sites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make a payment via the ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photograph and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says the spokesperson for the NGO "Right to Gun" Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Macarov for $100
When you buy an illegal firearm, you usually pay from $100 to $900, according to experts' estimates.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "Right to Gun" you'll buy a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait for a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from warehouses to long-term storage through warehouses in the middle cell.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period January - October 2011 and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fastfood and supermarket workers strike in the USA
Working at the box office of "McDonald" will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages has risen in Walmart hypermarkets and popular fast food chains such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or whether it is destined to die soon.
The whole stock is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the increase in modest salaries received by ordinary workers in Walmart and in fast food systems, the objective of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, seized millions of people, and in some cases was accompanied by fighting.
On this day, some Walmart workers, working at 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists from multinational companies in the business chains, whose goods are intended for people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage employees in Walmart stores only buy at their work.
The availability and range of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply because he pays very little of his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or handheld scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded a raise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company increased sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't correspond to the cost level, says the employees.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the increase in wages fully to consumer arms, every visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s advocates point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and should not cause virtually any damage to the company.
The "Black Friday" at the company’s stores lasted from 8:00 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, her cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "black Friday".
In an interview for Huffington Post's left-wing website, Dan Fogelman said that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was all "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart stores (those in that progressive city are not very popular, and therefore they are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick, and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal law and New York state regulations.
Fast food restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average their staff in New York gets $8.90 an hour.
No one has lower wages in this precious city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the desk after school part-time and live with their parents will be employed by "McDonald".
Few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At the moment, I am constantly meeting with the staff of "McDonald" who complain that they must live on this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast food companies start receiving at least $15 an hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also called for trade unions to be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. laws prohibit the administration from obstructing the establishment of trade union organizations and punishing trade union activists by bullying and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, it is also difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food businesses for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, loud protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the event was the assembly at McDonald, near Times Square at noon, where several local democratic politicians spoke, especially a member of the Jumaane Williams City Council, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn't even pay you sick and don't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that 'we must speak together to support fast food workers so that they can achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity, as every New Yorker deserves!'
As the New York Times described it, it was the biggest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although by far not all of them were fast food workers who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has managed to deceive on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular theme of extended reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google presented a working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for the patent.
An interview with the head of an interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi shows that glasses are already a thing of the past for scientists of this company.
It appeals to the perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
Please tell us, in general, what does your research group do?
- We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has been stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, touching the screen with its finger at most.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is for sale today without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting control option using gestures.
- What else can we do in the future?
- Not to mention that Kinect has transferred the interaction to a physical level, very many interactions are still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been separately.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, for this purpose it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimated?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - a question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling equipment in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not squirming, just such squalid, short ones.
The gesture would not be taken with a camera device, but with a bracelet to monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to tell.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or can't at a given moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These may be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you are to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can bounce back from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
At the present point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to designers of algorithms.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So the velocity, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Bethis made our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while current, serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra frames per second.
And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, to play with the curvature of the camera location and see how this helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don't you think that when it comes to everyday use of advanced reality technology with special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding a smartphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "transferable" form of an extension of reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones at any time on the basis of the clouds platform, projection screen and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in which their power (private things are seen only by you), and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't smell anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that widespread reality - that is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think adding tactile perceptions could easily be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is being used - using the second hand as a kind of background for displaying.
It records the compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactileness to these "images in the air" - such as interference of several directional ultrasound rays at the defined point where the finger is located, causing a tactile feeling, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on your fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
So he thinks he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a target, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in the very beginnings.
Tasteful instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohrad avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, is an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already important figures of the art scene of St Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without reaching all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who's all dressed in red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, the one at the Summer Garden, the one at the fashion pubs and at the openings.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're exposed, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical Petrohrad storytellers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets brings a smile on the faces of citizens, he enhances everyone's mood.
He recently took a bottle of wine and became a St. Petersburg bottle of wine, because he matured into this complex role with all his bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town all red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that differs a little bit from gray is arousing aggression and arousing bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonevs, who led us to the "Pushkin 10", and there were no more waves.
It attracts me to theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except the word.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of Petreburg, where all the best powers of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I took my place at Pushkinská 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of the Bohemian bohemian.
Many were born there:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Snura was brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogha".
Snur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight leotards, in the middle of them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachténberg, so he began his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and constant guests went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 a survey was organized in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
I was named in the "Artist of the Year" nomination, which ended my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In current years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the currentness and penetration are captured live.
I'm going to have a program show called the Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, it's painful and terrible to be like this today.
But clowns wipe everything off, they take the tragedy.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through a totalitarian disguise in order.
Today, people meet by clothing, they focus on external mechanics, not on the inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We saw you the other day as a town flaner. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be, if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
Back in the day, people met in groups, the bohemian loved one, simple other people.
Today everything broke down at the micro-company, today it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to be liked by everyone.
Today, you need to think about who you're gonna like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand viewers will come to Stasu Mikhail!
- He's gonna get hit by fans, where the sexual social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come to cultural land and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, less money, everything's wasting away.
I've got fans, the main thing is that no one fools them and breaks what's been going on.
When I was young, I used to paint pictures that hung on a collector's wall along with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often mistake concepts.
They say:Culture of the spiritual, culture of the consumer.
There's no consumer culture, that's from somewhere else.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money for drawing paintings.
And I'm all for culture.
Cyril, what's the shortage in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a term: an active in culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the time of the proper Tsars, this was not the case in everything, perhaps the Tsars did not understand culture very well, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St Petersburg who might be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because they need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and guide them on the right path.
It's tasteful today.
The same Erartus, but it differs by saying honestly that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petersburg is?
- Petreburg - it's not the capital of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And on our eel, art thrives poorly.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers than readers in our country today, that's wrong.
There are many people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, this layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion thing, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented on the basis of a grant from St.Petersburg
To give birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with Earthers on board are on their way, searching for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how do you keep your family in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars," says a high-ranking scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, the surface of Venus reaches a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500 ° C].
It's only possible to live there at high altitudes or in Venus orbit... in space.
Scientists with flora began to address the questions of reproduction in the universe.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was carried out in orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to verify how the embryo develops in a weightless state.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird at the exit.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find its support, must stand on its own feet and start to move," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find a support, the birds fall chaoticly and make a thump.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds had total extinction of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, within four days, they just died.
"We had birds hatched twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarch" with the animals went into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only beings of one sex.
There has been an experiment with rats that have been transmitted to space already gravitational.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such experiments must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, a progeny was born to the cosmic rats.
But it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
When animals lose their usual environment, they simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Human, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens rules by abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The Tereshkovs were in the greatest danger.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Tchaik took off and no one on Earth could tell if they could make it to space.
Whether she can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," says Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after a flight into space, Valentina Tereshkova's first wife-cosmonaut gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolaev.
In 1988 the son of the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savicky was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, born after long years and growing healthy offspring.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says the cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet mankind must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection, and artificial gravity.
CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero-attraction conditions, spacemen develop the habits needed to work in an open universe.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although water is a comfortable environment for adults, it is a natural element for young children.
Little ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the child being in the mother’s amniotic water for an average of 9 months and making it easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, because only two weeks have passed since the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath.
"That's very little to make the baby forget something," says the Newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if a weightless condition is more natural for a newborn baby, then for women, the inevitable gravity, the attractive force, is more natural.
In a weightless state, abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, the ability of the body to expel the fetus decreases very rapidly.
We can put that aside if muscle stimulation works during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"And what next?" asks Valery Polyakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If earth’s attraction doesn’t affect the organism, it can’t properly form a skeleton or a system of muscles.
A newborn in orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He'll just be deprived of what he absolutely needs to develop.
"If we go with you to an experiment that admits the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who is completely unadapted to the environment here," predicts the head of the Bioethics Committee IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when they will become a reality and when the earthlings will set out in their ships on a faraway planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
Head of the SAO: Control of the shoe system failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good auditors and quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but it is limping in its application.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, it is said by Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think is missing from us," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Nečas' approach to the so-called "sharc system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with his controls - is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be set, and if it forbids something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of an office which is obliged to check and enforce obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties in which public procurement legislation was compared in both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice.
We have put all this together, and even though the control is not yet completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "more stringent and perfect" in our country, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to devote itself to the application of the law itself.
What can this project do for you, what does it mean for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop making efforts to refine laws, reduce and improve limits when this does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to rule out enrichment and possibly criminal acts.
But we don't necessarily have to achieve that by lowering the limit on contracts.
Maybe the system will be overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will be able to draw more easily than if the limit were to remain higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with transposing public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the SAO works there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, only forms in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed similarly.
The powers are also to some extent similar, however, because Germany has a federal structure, so it has these accounting courts at the level of individual Länder - this is a little different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds administered by the regions and municipalities are controlled from the level of the federal accounting courts.
As far as the legislation is concerned, it's easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better at everything.
Is it necessary, then, that they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it has to be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be of any benefit to them to work with our office, would it?
As far as domestic legislation is concerned, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, have its effects been reflected in any way?
Since the validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet reflected in the controls.
Since we're doing ex post checks, there's a certain delay to be taken into account.
We are only observing this in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new tool "risk detection of inefficiency", through which we have driven almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - that is, of course, where the changes will take place, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
Do you therefore consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
A problem that may arise here that the rules will "strengthen" and will not be able to be followed.
Already for the functioning of previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is the law worth tightening up in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't go.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur by checking on the so-called 'sharc system' - and what does that mean?
Is the shoe system forbidden or allowed?
After all, the law has to be set up, and if it forbids something, the Prime Minister can't prevent the work of an office that has a duty to check and enforce obligations.
He can say, "Let's change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're gonna act like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are fairly strict rules on what is to be formally done - which is right to protect the competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that a candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think is missing from us.
The roads are frosted, but mostly mobile.
In several places of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are mobile, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region, the roads were mobile this morning, but sometimes frozen and also snowy.
Temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is supposed to get slightly warmer during the day.
The snowing in the region has ceased and the lowlands have only a weak layer.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimetres of snow.
The places were also lower visibility due to fog, resulting from data dispatch of regional roadmen.
The R6 and first class roads are now mobile in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, in some overbridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also mobile.
But there are still remains of frozen snow and snow in some sections.
Especially in higher altitudes, extra attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubicky and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of icy, in higher altitudes and on the mountains there may be a strange layer of snow on roads, it informs on its website the Directorate of Roads and Motorways.
Roadmakers warn the driver of the icing, it can be formed mainly in higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitav or Vysoké Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlicka Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest position on the roads in the districts Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia it is most often clear up to half clear today without precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, wind is weak.
Plzensky Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are mobile this morning, but with caution and the ride needs to be adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures are between three and nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication may be frozen.
The seats must also count on the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It's based on information from the dispatch of the county roadmen.
The D5 motorway is almost unlimited, but caution is advised by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
But there may be frosted sections in southern Pilsen and Tachov.
Communication of the second and third classes are damp and in this case also the frosted sections are alerted.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent trips in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Today, drivers heading for the highest positions of the Olomouc Region must count on snow mash on the road.
After the chemical sprinkles remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the way towards the Videl Cross.
Roadmen were driven into the field by snow at night, in Šumpersk according to the road managers they snowed about three centimetres.
In other parts of the region, roadways are usually mobile without restrictions.
"In Šumpersku lies the remnants of snow in the highest positions.
The drivers must count on snow mash on the Red Mountain saddle in the direction of Jeseník," the Czech News Agency told the Czech News Agency today.
In the field at night also their colleagues went to Jesenice, the roads up to and above the highest positions are now, according to them, after chemical treatment bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are accessible without restrictions, but in Šternbersk drivers should be careful in forest sections where the roads remained damp.
Ústí Region, Liberec Region
A few hard-to-go places are reported by roadmen in the north of Bohemia this morning.
In addition to several places with snow or icebergs, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice to Ústeck is closed, it follows from the police database.
Temperatures are also held in lower positions below zero, so the ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of České středohoří, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operating complications have not yet been reported.
The presence of icebergs is reported by roadmen especially from the surroundings of Szczecin.
According to meteorologists, at night the ideal conditions for her - during the day, rain and melting snow, at night were clear and frosty.
From the main moves, adverse conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border between Ústí nad Liberecký Region and Liberec Region.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice forced bent branches of trees that bent to the ground under the snow.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages we people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national fund-raiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to exploit the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
Three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held at the same time on December 20th from 9:00 p.m.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we worked out everything together with our artist Jan Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to consider, together with the public, the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoe objects, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap together with other performers also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world called "The End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in the end, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will be connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the video is played by Tomáš Hanák, in which he also sings Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of fundraising events and concerts...
We try to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What's the end-of-the-world profit?
The equipment of the barrier-free training centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in Jedlicek Institute.
The students of Jedlicek Institute regularly run out of lecturers and devote them to activities that entertain and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go as teachers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
As part of the completion of Jedlicek Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several music groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you pick them out?
We've been trying to build a program that will reach out to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic events" for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are in the USA, would like to connect it with the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these paths logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on the electric cart, her carts have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we carry with us a lot of cargo and tool boxes...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, that I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differs in barrier-freeness, public access to handicapped people and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have just seen in Russia that everything is still in the beginnings of the East.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric cart to move alone in the city centre.
They don't even pay as much of a price as you prefer wheelchairs in an elevator.
Fortunately, civil associations are already being established there, trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
On the other hand, how do we still have more developed countries to catch up on?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improvements and improvements to the situation are always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with heavy disabilities to move separately in public, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, wherever...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in which we are a little ahead of The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will things change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I joined Jedlicek Institute as a tutor, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, so I started an interest music club with my colleague.
And over time, as our host Lada Angelovich says, things got a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with famous singers and also actively work on the promotion of the band.
We realized that a job that we can't see is basically like it doesn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of stuff where one imitates the other.
It's logical in a way, everything new is accepted carefully and it takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But the regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that when people with disabilities do something, it's not just for them, it's for the whole company.
Did that success also help that you are a strict boss, as many people have identified you?
In order to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic imagination and a head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, go to prep school, and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap band currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, there's no stopping it.
Who has the will and the taste, always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21:00
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will connect with the telemost during the singing of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at Jedlicek Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free admission tickets in presale Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flight; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I will recall the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entering Space.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha Prize for his entry into space in France.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned space promoter, and his contribution was appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925 a railway line was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was intended to be used to start the drezín or to brake it.
Information about this drezín is only known from the period press.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to engage with missile missiles.
Research was provided by Komorka Techniki Ubrozenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is evident from preserved materials that research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, by the arrival of German troops, research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of the photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press and in the following year the work of Rakiet - torpeda powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza by Leliwy-Krzywoblocký came out.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) dedicated all the projects of military use of rocket technology to the temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of its activity ended the start of the war.
Further work on cosmonautics appears after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish astronaut society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the Society is mentioned in the November issue of the 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, which contains four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is designed to create a society that will deal with cosmonautics.
By then, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronaut Federation (founded in 1951) and already in autumn, PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first Chairman of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronaut Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of a very successful Meteorologiczna meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, improved version of RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should have been able to do real scientific work - rocket RM-34 should have reached up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
Following the first RM rockets, the Meteor-1 rocket was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types were developed (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in size of space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A, a space of 0.4 liters, a 0.34 litre Meteor-1B and a 0.62 litre Meteor-1C were available.
The maximum available for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the development of the Meteor-2 rocket was taking place at the Aerospace Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is still important to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites under Interkosmos, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict among themselves.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in labour prices, (major) price tensions occur.
Under that term, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer is trying to compete with the imports of cheap goods by "inducing" the price of the competitor in order to bring down more market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means either transferring production abroad or buying or dying there.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for unemployment produced by it, the social costs of the state are necessarily increasing.
The whole situation is heightened by the total reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Unconsiderable private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are putting private capital at risk for their own population, regardless of the social downturn.
This is mainly reflected in the changes to the applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to adopt a price dictate of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and by limiting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For many years, there have been public food dispensaries in the Slovak Republic for poor people who cannot make a living with their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for duly employed people to receive such wages that the state must pay them to an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people are forced to emigrate either under the pressure of a catastrophic social downturn, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on hunger wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital may eventually come into the country.
But here it is necessary to ask where will it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African are still working for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media suggest that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly insists that the State must not interfere with the economy through management interventions.
Then it must be asked whether it affects private capital, now it is actually governing politics and thus the whole state in its own egotistical sense.
There's a definite answer, isn't there?
The evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In the Slovak Republic, the situation is that the state ministries, due to lack of funding, are giving draft laws to private law firms, which are heavily related to industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people like Western-type constitutions, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly getting into a situation, as Appianos describes in his work of the Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete decay and the authorities have occupied themselves with violence.
For bribery, illegal favors, and with the help of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant without any scruples, and the people went to elections with a pre-sold voice" ..."Character people did not apply for office at all, so one day as a result of this break-up he was standing without consuls for eight months". "It began to be said that the only cure in a bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man." Appianos thought of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who changed into a permanent democracy into self-government.
Conclusion As in ancient times, the current society is based on a reckless preference for its own benefit, regardless of the social interest.
By its very nature, private capital is no longer able to understand and exercise social benefits.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence of the elites without any effort to reform the deeper nature.
So we must look for the causality of the onset of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current situation, the demise of these systems in favour of a liberal-type democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of another round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the possible hundreds of thousands of lives losses in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure of competition, both at international and internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms, which will strengthen the state's participation in the economy, strengthen citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Chaos Lab.
"Nothing comes from violence and never can" Sting in Fragile's song whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no dying Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, many reactions have arisen.
Some stand behind Israel, argue its right to self-defense, and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, genocide against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fits into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically repeating waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's people of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and had not experienced the beginning of violence.
I want to offer readers a view behind the curtain, a view of who the 95-year-long tension has served (calculated from Balfour's Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events of modern history.
Human history is primarily a struggle for power.
In every era, we can track down an Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities who have completely autonomously guided their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predicated goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one that could be considered the head of an octopus (if anyone is still standing above them I do not know, but I do not rule it out) - Rothschilds.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
They bought the first press agency (Reuters) already in the 19th century to stop joining their name with highly criminal acts, in whose background they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank do not have or prepare wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Central Bank status of Rothschild’s Bank of America, began to issue his own (understanding government) money during the Civil War, and was murdered in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, he was murdered 1963, a Member of the Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led between 1859 and 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war had the task of removing large monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially the United Kingdom, and the third was to reduce the world's population to some 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume so much resources), creating one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a front for such a solution) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of richest families led by Rothschieldy works is to create a crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, so as not to repeat crises such as those triggered in 1907).
So after they succeeded in murdering the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to start World War I, they destroyed Tsarish Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (no longer needed a war to destroy the Tsarist Russia) and subsequently a fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria, Hungary.
To facilitate the launch of World War II, the bankers allowed politicians to create a latently conflicting situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating a prerequisite for radicalization of impoverished masses, and then all they had to do was just plant a strong enough, blameful and simple solution on the Germans, offering the Fuhrer and further creating a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also played, a fifth column function, when the war fire was lit.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds encouraged the founding of the Zionist movement, whose branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea and Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration has created a prerequisite for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clash with the local Arab population has begun.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler broke out of the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or everything he did was planned to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created a prerequisite for acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like Germany’s war reparations, the outbreak of the third war was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, like the other, will be victims in the front lines of battle, now along with the Arab or Muslim populations of the Middle East in general.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let us take just how sharply the people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like in our country, international bankers are putting exclusively their own candidates to choose from.
Israel’s current prime minister, the Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism to international bankers loyal, a policy that is doing its best to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to grow into a global conflict and the control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, which travels 20% of all world oil (the waterway is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a completely controlled being.
"And he compels all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, to have on their right hand or the brand on their forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of its name.
That's to be understood: who has the sense to add up the number of the beast?
That number marks a man, and it's a number of six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo Film: When the Worst Is, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, he occupied a crowd of Islamist students at the American Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohamed Réza Pahlaví, who fled to the US after the revolution, which had been patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would in principle endanger confidence in allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The prison diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The debacle in Iran has contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes an episode of the history that brought America a tiny victory.
Just before the embassy was taken, six employees escaped.
After difficult peripets, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, while helping an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who watched locations for science fiction movies in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan devised by the exfil expert Tony Mendez also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a backstabbing - can be an example of a series of Danny's partners.
The film thus alternates moods - on the one hand documentively conceived sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, light-weight passages from Hollywood, negotiated with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - the men in suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had a remarkable way of rebooting his career.
He became a respected director of the mocked actor, and even his acting ceased to be a target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film that does not take place in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the director’s older films raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the initial sequence of the embassy’s fall is impressive in its clarity, which simultaneously conveys the emotion of confusion and unimaginability that occurs when history moves out of nowhere.
Affleck and his coworkers achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (false crew on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many stories in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
He almost works successfully with it, sometimes he thinks something about reality - there everything doesn't go so elegantly (scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport turns away a phone call in America and the runway chase seems pretty far-fetched).
But the weakness of the Arga is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many stories in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the role of Hollywood coworkers, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film kind of loses a dramatic move, it's a film that can be watched with mild interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
It's hard to break.
As a reminder of one living history so far, as well as evidence of how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which announces an annual survey for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led to this by the last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the lead of large European companies," Patrik Nacher told the Czech poll organizer.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent European Court decision to unify insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured at life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky to insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulations include mandatory incorporation of biocomponents into fuels, which is due to the damage to nature, the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of hens' cages, which has made the eggs significantly more expensive this year.
The criticism has also previously faced a de facto ban on the use of the term spread butter or the elimination of classical light bulbs from sales.
High-quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of one or the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic is now also threatening veto enforcement of the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also based on the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and did not have to show "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising the existing non-uniform national standards that complicate trade.
Despite the opposition of some states, the EU has already softened the standards on fruit and vegetables, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation may also be a candidate for winning the poll, according to which it must be mandatory for sold inflatable balloons to be notified that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed to American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of death of children to suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing into fairies.
Curious ideas are born at home
There is also a relatively absurd rule concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has an official office in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia) instead.
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, the Bank Charges.com has nominated a survey in addition to some of the above absurdities, such as the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU established the maximum levels of food stocks that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, specified volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
Even the idea of paying some countries for their lack of the sea and the idea of granting subsidies on a request for a subsidy has impressed the survey organizers.
These ideas, however, did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, it was supposed to be full warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the fact that the Czech Republic has moved on to the ports.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for the acquisition of the subsidy was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, directed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), namely to write a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easily targeted by criticism in the Member States, EU efforts to regulate and, at the same time, the more efficient functioning and development of the whole Union deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
The more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, drawing EU subsidies on projects that have no indication of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by the Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The emotion among Czechs is that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, and it will not always succeed in this match.
After six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, Czechs maintained the designation of Olomouc shapes, but Czech rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed a domestic rum.
Only cane distillate products, not sugar beet, cane distillate products, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered EU products, the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, and Parma hams have already found themselves, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, pohořalický and Třeboňská carp and žatek hops.
Pardubic gingerbread and mustard tubes can also be proud of the EU trademark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does one think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked without a problem in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the last 20 years of the country robbing, the thieves running around, people's taxes and retirement age increase.
I shouldn't have been an ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent non-party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Aren't you turning your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying this whole time that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later stated that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool for how I can realize my visions.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The problem, however, is not only that as a nation we curse in a pub and in television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
This will be added to the media that devalues a person and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to bribe journalists or to have been a counselor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
In the fight for the Castle you set off with the thesis of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and back-to-back property returns over twenty million.
You have to change the law to do that.
But as president, you do not have such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I lobbyed as a citizen to make the tour guide a free trade, I managed to get it through.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, he deliberately rejects it, and that delays citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party labeling and dogmat I can take something that is best for our country from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing person or a left-wing person?
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people place me more to the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone's on the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose the wrong idea.
You get sore when someone says you're a populist.
But you're not proving it by what you said?
When you make a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Some may call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they have been talked about by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, all you have is passwords.
And you can't keep up with that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will succeed in enforcing, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists, and the public and try to get them on our side to push it through.
If I were elected president, there is no problem in organizing a live television broadcast where I will ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to say why they didn't want it.
When a strong personality is named as vices, it can be pushed to the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, that was due to public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I have only just begun in politics, and I will try to get majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things myself, if I can't, I'm gonna quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, which is why I've been going around a lot of known people to see if they'd run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, he refused for a lot of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenc, who was spreading light-fueled oil scams.
I ran for it because people are really unhappy, but now I'm in a bind.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and most of them chose establishment representatives.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have elected the Senate so that it will be difficult to push for change.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering starting your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to look into the clean past of every potential party, and I don't even have the money.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only $20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land of about 25 million, an apartment of ten million, another apartment of eight million, a collection of artworks of about ten million, an Aston Martin of 3.5 million, and a Škoda Superb of a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was gallant with women, while fighting against bad things and bad things.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million worth of property, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
Am I supposed to be in debt?
I've already spent 2.5 million on the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program may not be that interested.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover my salary as a senator.
But I wouldn't make it out of it, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you would dampen these activities?
But it has nothing to do with the pay.
As promised, I have partially subdued my activities.
For example, my representative will become a travel agent in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much were you used to taking a month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400 grand, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You'll find the whole interview in the Saturday's Rights issue.
The architects of MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not take place only in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"The building looks fun to me, looks futuristic. Finally, something interesting is again to see," says Lisette Verhaig, who is walking around on the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, means, "Of course, the house is nice."
However, I ask why we still need a library today.
They all have Internet, iPads and electronic books.
No one comes to any of these old-fashioned libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This community with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not staggering.
And so the city councilmen knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rtterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of madly courageous bar graphs and contractor of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm and at a competition meeting in 2003 appeared with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the committee looked around astoundingly and shrugged its shoulders, the insolent Maas threw his gifts at himself according to size and ended his activist speech with the words "Dear Township!"
So this is my proposal for the Mount of Books in Spiikenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million mountain was built up.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which so far could not offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, makes it richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
First of all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of its existence.
Long way to the book
First impression: reading eldorado under the cheese hatch.
While the mountain massif runs the lift, the real spatial and reading passions can only be discovered during walking topography.
From all sides, the glass interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt convertible and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally stands shelves with books along the facade and there is a large dark space in the middle, which is usually incoherent and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down, and we pushed the space for the reader from the inside out.
The inside of the Mountain of Books is well used: offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and home technology switchboard are located on Wednesday.
A special delight is the black bookshelves, which are one wall panel, one sill, and another by the railing of stairs.
The appearance, structure, and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and construction engineers twist their heads over unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the town of Spijkenisse, on the question of Standard magazine.
So one day, in a French farm, we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in glasshouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimetre fleece from synthetic matter has been used as a base under the roots.
It's cheap and time efficient.
Thin fabric lasts one or two seasons and then is ready to be thrown into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - was pressed on the plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
By causing heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 stairs you can reach the top.
At the end of the nearly 500 meter long journey you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but in spite of many glass surfaces, this house is an example project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It heats up and cools the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in only a short time, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden bindings, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shadow and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
He can handle the rest of the fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial sceptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as "a long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: A few weeks ago, every resident of the city was invited to open a book from his personal fund.
The optical gaps in the currently not fully equipped library, currently accounting for 70,000 pieces, were to be filled first.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This succeeded MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in the professional jargon.
Spizkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
That's the starting point for identity, after all.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in deciding on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
But now Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support America's position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libya uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
NATO finally put it through.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, in the direction of the US-led policy, so to speak, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just settling in, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as they have in France or the UK.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It shows preparedness to take national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, namely export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany has to protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to scare away the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
Well, that's got to play a part.
But I wouldn't want to add too much importance to it, but that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany’s relations with the US damaged when Germany abstained on both important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I think there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a turning point as it was on the Libya issue.
Perhaps Germany will even earn some respect.
This indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, made it clear for veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of US internal policy.
I think that Obama's government may secretly have a considerable understanding of the European position.
But, as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, be held publicly.
I don't think the differences in opinion are at all as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very happy about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently not happening.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead they have to push things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
That's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still unpleasant, and it is still difficult for this country to play a larger role for obvious reasons.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany adopts a larger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all the neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The US's influence on European policy is now falling steadily, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This hides a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they continue to enjoy protection until they are sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will achieve justice.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
A few more letters are enough for counterfeiters to sign their tags.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, they will have Prada-Kny registered.
In this way, German companies, such as Puma sports goods, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder with a record of a stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma brand protected. The artificial name that parasitics even in the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several storeys in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch’s cases are different, however, and under the authority of his mandants, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies have been given the right to use a brand that is already protected somewhere else from the stamp office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging business, we have to fight it," Pattloch calls.
"The mark dilutes, the sole position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and judicial costs of the affected industry go into millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to CLSA, China, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, is the third largest market in luxury goods and the fastest-growing market.
However, the deletion of dubious records in the register of brands is difficult to achieve and costs.
Driving can last up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the title claimed became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a law of the jungle.
Known cases include graphic items.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sana, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of pumps for the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem similar to the star of the Mercedes.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
In China, the manufacturer of Lacoste fashion goods lost to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO stamp office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and premises.
But last year, it was said that "the progress of the work process has returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, 81,500 complaints are still pending at the office.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China has been running a list of new applications around the world for the tenth time.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are 5,5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were collected at fees.
Simply this means that each entry costs an average of 1280 Yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs several times to start a dispute, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitated automotive parts has been abolished.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to Freudenberg.
We would have forgotten it ourselves, as the last name cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances Freudenberg has gained law, but the opponents continue to fight in the dispute to this day.
You need to be careful.
The matter is now being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Management is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified, and they even had to look at the records in the company's archive a hundred years ago to produce evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered a "high six-digit amount in euro" to the counterparty in vain in order to settle the dispute.
"From this you can see what it means to us," says Wentzler.
There is a risk that Europe will also be affected by the danger from the Far East.
And that's when the impersonators secure their unprotected plates.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business has been abandoned by the group, yet it has been able to avert registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch counsel German businesses to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international stamp rights. Foreigners should rather "all that is worth protecting in any way also in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be a lot more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of his drama, then he may have to pay the counterparty license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed off the market in the disputed segment.
World Day to Fight AIDS: Thumping, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation rehearses - and in Swaziland, orphans of parents who died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that transcends much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there's the stomping: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's moccasins look for tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - push, mom and each other.
The 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopf, almost lifts it out of his textile shoes when he joins the voices with his slow, wild gestures.
It's Monday night in the music hall of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute, the Imbongi choir is trying out a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years old, from a researcher in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir voice has a different text and even more in a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
Unaids, a United Nations AIDS - combat program, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of which 23.5 million live in South Africa.
There are 245 000 orphans in Swaziland from parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For the 180 orphans of parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, the Society of Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second-degree school.
A patronage can be taken over for 15 or 20 euros a month.
Guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "narrator of stories" or "he who praises" in the language of zulu.
In this space, no one can speak through gascants, but sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes it brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, there is an Esitjeni village in the northeast of Swaziland, which depends on the size of the German congregation’s voices.
Forty percent is infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjeni you can see in a small, which makes the whole of Swaziland sick: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry the virus weakened immunity within themselves. It is not rare that they die at less than 30 years of age.
This village was discovered by the congregation in the spring of 2005. Above all, Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completed schooling, they have no chance in a poor country at all.
At first it was a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros per year allowed the child to be sent to school and given him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a group of "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since taken almost professional care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI belongs to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
HIV, human papillomavirus, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis are common viral SPIs.
Muncrumbs and scabs are part of the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch’s Institute assumes that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of those newly infected with HIV are included in this group.
Among juveniles, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, we often have human papillomaviruses among teenagers.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases have to be reported.
According to the Institute of Robert Koch, the number of syphilis infected was more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIV patients has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than a year before.
What symptoms draw attention to venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulty in urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, so they will remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
The risk of infection can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because sexually transmitted disease agents can also be partially passed on to infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent replacements of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least to the fees that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
"We have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjen," says the president of Annette Lennartz.
He manages money from Germany in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can make it.
He also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, such as in one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the language of zulu is called to old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children arrived every day on time in their uniforms for school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cookbooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children daily.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" founded a sewing school, built two hens, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had an HIV test.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King and 14 Wifes
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's pretty strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his unmitigated lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state - approved way of life is responsible for the spread of HIV so rapidly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To support cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi Choir travels once every two or three years together in the south of Africa and sings songs full of grief, combatism, confidence in the future and confidence of black people, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of black people - such appreciation brings not only mood and joy, but also shed tears among many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the river Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," people say.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers from here, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there's ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even though it is the closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as follows from three studies published on Thursday by the specialist magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let us not put the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leader of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, findings could help us to explain how water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and little robots like Phoenix, undetected by earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the Earth, small windows to endless distances.
The film comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is circling the Sun to Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This cut from an infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, worse identifiable are pink colored "novores" in the birthing hall of stars.
This area where stars are formed - scientists call it unromantic W5 - discovered Spitzer's telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The muffin ring is made up of material that the star flogged during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid nebula, which is 5400 light years from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
A photograph of the Galactic "Cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The cluster of Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, is visible at night to the naked eye.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors stand out better.
The Helix nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellations of Aquarius.
Its similarity to the earthly continent brought forth this nebula called North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is a source of extraordinary discoloration.
This "minimum" among the stars was able to dream up the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope in full beauty.
Saturn and its rings: how they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: the vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
The footage published by the European Southern Observatory depicts a few thousand light years away from the Trifid Nebula in the Bishop constellation.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "triffidus" (divided into three parts, three-klanný), because the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar maternity ward into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonoš astronomers photographed the portent of cosmic collisions: 400 million light-years from the Earth, the core of two collaborating galaxies is on each other and inevitably a collision must occur.
This birth of the star was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical shortcuts, you can call it the nickname South Windmill.
The photograph from Hubble's Space Telescope shows the cutout of the Iris nebula in the Cefea constellation.
This 1400 light - years - distant nebula consists of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the usual household dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a black hole ring that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of the stars gives rise to ever-new additions.
Also, these star clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are still giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only shortly after the Big Bang when hydrogen was mostly in the universe.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
It was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, a year later before Galileo, he used it to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In American Arizona, there's a Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its average is about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of cheap design: The telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
At a height angle, the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed.
Its peculiarity is the high intensity of the luminous flux.
This is equal to the world’s largest mirror telescopes, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Portorico), scientists in space are searching for alien signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner who makes its computing performance available can help.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Very Large Telescope is standing here, honoring his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should be full of 42 meters and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck’s telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The cube telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
There is also a new giant telescope on Mauna Kea - with a 20-foot mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
The most significant impressions from space, however, are conveyed by Hubble’s space telescope.
The photographs of distant worlds have been provided to us since 24 April 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The picture shows the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
James Webb's Space Telescope (JWST) will be fired into space on the Ariane5 rocket first in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6,5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume there's ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as Messenger is circling this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that Mercury has been iced.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first one around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many will live to see the Bible’s age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many will live to see the Bible’s age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call riding the Talysh Mountains wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the road with many corners along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and plain farm buildings.
Everything's green and juicy, we almost seem to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the extremity of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh lives, which is not known for much, except that they speak both Persian and Azerbaijan perfectly and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This small town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is not suitable for picturesque mountain landscapes.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arriving from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only a single-current road.
The fairytale wealth for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
But Pilate Fatulajeva (48) believes that Lerik has the power to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulajeva says.
She's the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of nearly eight dozen Talysh in the vicinity, who are over 100 years old. Fatulajeva shows black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
However, the disputed star of this museum is the sheep herder, Óirali Müslümov, who was allegedly 168 years old.
Of course, the birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulajeva explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he still had a daughter.
Is it true, then, that Mirali Müslümov was wrong at his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"Absolutely many people of old live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, no scientific evidence of age can be provided due to the lack of evidence, especially when the registers are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area of Lerik often live out Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why, then, do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatuliev Museum believes that this is about nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread, and, above all, dairy products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem to be very credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a small settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzaeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a buttercup, which he launders tirelessly.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayev and a daughter. Both are long ago grandparents.
There are two little kids jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for guests, which is served in typical bellies of "armad".
Mirzayev's white teeth form a perfect line and hide a long dark blond braid under the scarf, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look like it and kept my color.
"I've never used shampoo either," says Mirzajeva.
A Monthly Retirement Enough to Live
All she ever ate was what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything got better when Geydar Aliyev took over the oar.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzajeva receives 230 manats a month’s pension (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the amount from which you can make a good living.
And perhaps even the long-grey son of Mirzaeva is right: "Old people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for, and happy.
If it's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Disarrayed demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the country’s deep disparity.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is being debated sharply.
Egypt's president didn't spare the pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And I am responsible for our success in front of people and God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, so far hopelessly wrangled in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of "God's State" on the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost apologized that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "save the revolution".
But what a 61 - year - old engineer who has a doctor’s degree at the University of Southern California really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear about.
Is the judiciary to be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs, which were approved by the Hundred-Headed Constitutional Assembly with the supremacy of Islamists in a fifteen-hour marathon, are partly alarming.
As in the earlier constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it can be feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least this explains the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, we need to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in a country with great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
That may not be the case, but it may mean that the cleric will exercise oversight over lawmaking, which would bring the judiciary to a de facto withdrawal of its right.
There is a lot of interpretation in the draft constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts is to continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak’s rule to suppress the opposition.
After the dictatorship fell, there were as many as 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is legally formulated so inexactly that by means of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality between men and women.
Yet another paragraph forbids the defamation or slander of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
However, it remains unclear what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally dubious to say that it is forbidden to insult people.
In this case, is a cartoon of the president or a joke on the account of law experts enough?
The matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular voting.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks the opposition has been forming against the numbers of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual union on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to apply.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who ranked third in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej said that the draft constitution belongs to "the dump of history".
Through the service of short Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to do a "discipline against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the opposition member Jasir Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Khalid Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
A well-organized Muslim Brotherhood has declared defiance of monstration, but not of caution in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile outside Cairo University.
She was attended by many veiled women and salafists who cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They challenged Morsi: "Clean the earth!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over Tahrir’s symbolic square, where it all began, would probably trigger a state of civil war.
Clearly, Morsi's supporters didn't want to take any chances.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country is supposed to go.
The majority is considered certain in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't exist once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, is aggravated by Hafiz Abu Sa'du.
Forty-eight-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial for Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the words 'human rights' are not once in the new constitution," he complains in an interview for "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's extension of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President effectively cancels it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could come back to him.
The protestor at Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster you can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk: The most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to a local appetite for an extraordinarily stinking fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
This will give you the smell paralyzing smell of rakfisk, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and there is an ubiquitous smell in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and it gets cold, the Norwegians are starting to meet here in Fagernes at the festival dedicated to this, as best to say, the most captivating food.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with lots of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to a rakfisk," says Havard.
Drinks can overpower the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, the fish soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses no doubt became dull with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, mostly emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and a large care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival, who was only recently much richer than Norway, are streaming into the country for work.
The rakfisk is viewed as something important, indispensable, although rather reeking part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often does not get into global news - and it seems to suit the majority of the population.
The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with disdain.
Instead, the shooting is called the July 22 event.
Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful land one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind the current wealth of Norway lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, represents a prototype of Nordic prosperity, who is serving plates with a lying rakfisko.
We are, as you say, considerate people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial crash were throwing money that they didn't have, the Norwegians had their purse strings tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of rakfisk.
I'm sure a moose burger like that is something else, and it's very juicy.
But tonight, the stinking fish is here again.
The hotel I live in is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast where a moderator with a bow tie is surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man might fall off the chair, possibly aquavitated.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC is looking at the challenges he faces, and at the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenge.
Mexico did well economically at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the clutches of a drug war that has already estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to reducing violence towards the Mexican people," President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before shaking hands with the US President, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state, Mexico.
The views of the new leader are different even in its old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural city of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered in a good way.
Citizens attribute the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the leaky and bumpy roads that were here earlier.
Plates with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state MP for the party of President Pen Niet, Party of the institutionalised revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so badly needs.
After 81 years of undisturbed power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
After 12 years outside the President's Palace of Los Pinos, MP Olvera admits that many are expected within the Party of Enrique Pena Nieto.
And he rejects the statement of opposition characterizing the new president as a person with no substance.
He's a very straightforward man, very interested with an excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Za, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Trapped under highway overpasses in many ways, it resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help manage drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, especially the intense violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a vast waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the better case, critics of Pena Nieto say that he failed to deal adequately with the problem of murdering women in his office.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of the derelict neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photographs of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body had been washed," Buendia recalls.
There were signs of a blow, and the postmortem rigor has already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, with the only word on it: Justice.
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossiper, troublemaker, and a whineer.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when so many mistakes and omissions have occurred," he says.
The Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised that they will be his priority while he is in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," says PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the victims’ families in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, claims the military prosecutor
The D.A.'s trying to disprove Bradley Manning's allegations of gross custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis of the gross treatment of Manning in prison.
Private is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents.
The U.S. Attorney is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak in US history, has missed many of the opportunities to complain about the gross treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor has Ashden Fein in cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit during the nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of maltreatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during the hearing on the defense's motion to dismiss the case brought against Manning on grounds of gross treatment at a time of detention, which in itself is a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
Army Intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is charged with stealing thousands of classified documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, the military prosecutor Fein and Manning went through the forms that the officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico Prison, where he was held in an increased security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers Manning were asking questions and recording his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the treatment of his guards "excellent" and considered the overall treatment of the facility "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of maltreatment, even though Manning's officers asked directly how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of her person in January 2011 when he met with a commission assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to reduce the "prevention of injury" regime.
The military stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under suicide surveillance) to protect and protect others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and one day he fainted because of the heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world has shrunk only to the base of Arifjan, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning reported that after arriving in Quantico he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, straps, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying there was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked questions about the charges he made on Thursday's deposition regarding the fact that, after being forced to sleep one night naked in her cell at Quantico, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other cellmates on the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket while counting.
On Friday's interrogation, Judge Manning stated that by order of his guards, he concluded that he had a blanket to cover himself, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the other night because he tried to show the officer that you were not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use his underwear belt or his wearers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his straps and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before a court-martial, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be reduced significantly.
The defense has stated that they are planning to plead guilty to minor crimes and that they will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon has stated that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations regarding all arrests being held in maximum security custody.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegal disclosure of intelligence documents on the Internet, transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If he's charged on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely got through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros").
I stood there for a few seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic acronym, just like when my friends in Boston are called "Ira" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
So later, I ended up calling myself "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have a vocabulary for a native speaker, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama's White House this week.
On the agenda, they had the usual issues to discuss when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to reach out to the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, even though he didn't give any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leaders under threat of arms to rewrite half of Mexican territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over the centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So one minute after the United States representative says something just a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will march on the warpath.
And yet Mexico has a real challenge to be related to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people the country offers options to, and others they don't.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparents who had been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person fit the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And while we live the American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's against the United States.
And besides, we're aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat, and they see us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left it.
And now we would not be trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in either.
In Mexico, they think of us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for their dealings with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel disdain for the way in which their family members were treated in much closer to the past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such thing is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary speculations about who started it, many buildings were turned into ruins, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
It may cause their struggle to be even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be not many reasons for optimism at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire on November 21st has lasted, the battles of this week have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Hamas’s leaders, the Islamic movement that has reigned in Gaza since 2007, will argue that they forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most pathetic and populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently being controlled by its fierce rivals of Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas’s leaders can well conclude that time is on their side.
The Islamists around the Arab world gained more influence, so Hamas made powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the resurrected regional power that once was Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering people of Hamas say that the Islamic Crescent surrounds Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah Party/Military rules, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclined to Islamism can depose Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi’s leadership in Egypt has changed, by far, the most populous and central Arab countries, the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
Hamas may appear in future diplomacy as a player who cannot be expelled by Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hardliners draw opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in a box.
The Israeli missile system Iron dome proved its worth and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the launch of the last round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, it has been relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that hits the West Bank, the main part of what may someday be the Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the election campaign on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, they wouldn't launch missiles, like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them if they stick their heads out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than all its four Arab neighbors combined.
The launch of a new war with a local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments to heal their economies.
President Morsi's cooperation with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may mean the beginning of something new.
Israelis too should look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination of a powder keg that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is making the situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.
Blood attacks against Gaza every few years to push Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides say, most of the outside world and these newspapers: the two states where Israel moves the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping fire will give pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must take a stand on stopping the supply of arms to Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside must also press for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has a hand in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first parliamentary term, he neglected the introduction of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's pathetically shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette wrappers have entered into force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, display warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australia’s laws on ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging, the first of its kind in the world, came into force, and logos and brand colours replaced with general olive green boxes with hideous pictures of sick parts of the body and depicting children and newborns ill as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures, they are mandatory from Saturday the only difference between the label names boxes printed in the same small print.
This is the world's most stringent tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding them of their attraction.
They rely on studies that show that if people don't start smoking at the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has lobbyed hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will lead to serious inadvertent consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette wrappers to cover up disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals regarding the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that Zico sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesale traders and expected new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch, experts are referring to the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan focuses.
Throughout a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is the insurmountable place you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Mrs Freeman has seen an increase in brand ratings on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and went to the trouble of creating this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it deals with new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to attack new regulations - a country within the World Trade Organisation declares that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of Australia's countries is trading significantly.
The SOO decision is expected to be delivered in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has been conducting talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that uniform boxes make it harder for him to stack them in shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "OK, that's it, let's close the shop," he said, and he threw his hands away.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
The last Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I've had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhonem (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and children's development experts are increasingly coming up with praise for boredom.
They say it is good for us (and our children) to be bored at times.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
Should we, then, encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century C.E.
And then the question is, how do we define boredom?
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to do it."
Boring is different from apathy by not being involved in anything, but wanting to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything about apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "disturbing the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slow passing time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, boring people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood, and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape on which a person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program silently reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, distractions can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and doodleing, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to wiggle will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom at times - the delay of my flight, the roaring speaker, especially the lengthy movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of being bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980’s developed a “Stip for Boring Vulnerability” (Bordom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions like: "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were away from school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would now, 21 years later, be higher or lower.
But he said that he knew that "adolescents are the peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble, or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodenovich, who had studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nude is a way of telling you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, said Professor Fenske.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of constant grinding activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise turns off."
There's no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and a soccer player from Southeast Colorado, faces criminal charges for something soon legal in the whole state - possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke her.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was driving with some friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was given a subpoena for possession of drugs and drug use equipment - minor offences for which there is $100 for every fine - and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on legalising a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends more on the spot than on the law.
Hundreds of offences for marijuana possession have already been cancelled here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults at the age of 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally permitted after the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and still accuse people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains vote to prevent the opening of new state licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is going so fast that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Even regulators in the state of Washington are gossiping about their heads.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licences for growing, manufacturing, distribution and sales - all until 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, whether for good or for bad, is ahead of most states in regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so he will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State alcohol licensing board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we can follow," he said.
The Washington Law, so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession will.
And there are intricate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state directive on "corresponding access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trafficking up to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"There will be no place more difficult to place licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Hemp, recently established research groups.
On November 21st, police chief Oates sent his officers an e-mail informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute for possession of a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over 21 years of age and that the police "with immediate effect" would stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce urban laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the district of Weld, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way of pushing users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences, which were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Buck said in his statement.
The response was complicated even in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer accuses adults of holding a small amount.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but he also decided not to dismiss all ongoing possessions.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado’s voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed a deep division among local officials in view of this great state-wide green experiment.
For the district attorneys, it's a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Laws on marijuana.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still cannot really accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on their way to becoming national drug legalization test cases.
The defense and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while waiting anxiously for instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana federal crimes.
The defense attorneys of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several arrests by marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients using it, who attracted attention, the federal government mostly left the medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to break down doors to capture a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will resist allowing state-controlled recreational marijuana stores permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy advisor to President Obama’s administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to advance.
Before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums for any new marijuana business, although it will take about a year before any trade can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely to enter into force next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where we issue a license and then we have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the community voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Today's university students are not the only ones who are attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest headquarters of knowledge, a modern-style wined Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
Meanwhile, in the late 1980 ’ s, within two weeks of taking up Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my suitcases and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard diary said I gave up because I objected to loving students in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson exhilarated that I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm bringing this up now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students on the right of the center suffer similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students sought equal rights protection, such as gays, people with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the younger class association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, "often they are actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are shown not to be welcome".
They call for a position to be established in the University Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently mentioned BBC Two TV documentary, entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about student political events, which he portrayed as freaks and neo-Nazis.
A graduate named Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a cane with a silver head.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are treated as "victim lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday's newspaper that "the leftist influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is 'unpleasant', while the 19-year-old president-elect UUCA Stephanie Cherill says that there has been a deterioration in the access of JCR members to the people on the right of Wednesday.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of a member.
I got on in September 1986, 18-year-old and crippling in a shy way.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the hottest.
A year earlier, the university voted to reject the honorary title of former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
Even Stalinists would tremble with fear from the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students meet with each other and with professors, I was given a taste of the wormwood that was to come.
I found that not only do professors quietly approve of taunting conservative pupils, but they also enjoy participating.
The policy of the mining strike, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought into the wooded auditoriums.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the 18th century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty tough about it.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very biley.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room with a broken heart.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
He was a second year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the UCA.
"I know who you are," he said graciously.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me now, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get even worse for you.
Most conservative freshmanes pretend to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I tried cowardly to pretend.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who (what irony) went to Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students didn't like him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
He beats each other up, doesn't he?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like - minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
For three years, they evolved in front of me as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the speakers.
He was barely there.
He hated that place for its provinciality and pettyness and for its tendency to Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took the position of professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dream moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes were gloomy.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week in the course of teaching, when another professor of history in absolute seriousness said that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed inside, I confessed to being brainwashed by my parents and calling them "old fools".
Relief was short-term.
My father put a nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I was crouching inside, and after five minutes, my stalkers gave up.
After they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snotty wuss.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and toxicity in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, though, it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but also today hide behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance rather than glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion", which started this week in London, ABC spoke to Nate Abascalová, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabel I, England, is the only place in Britain's capital to host Valentino Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the famous retrospective "Valentino: master of fashion", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his respected clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by a rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, overflows with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Voghera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international "Bohemian elite".
There's nothing wrong with loving royal families.
"They don't give you the tiniest tip of a cigarette in a great carpet, like some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests entertained abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains his ex-wife, "Heini" Thyssen, and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to glory.
And he's still a star."
Valerie Mazza performs Valentina
The designer's charisma is not forgotten by Argentina's model Valerie Mazz.
"It has been many years since we went to his house for dinner after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and there were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every tiny detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, he reflected in everything and felt his spirit.
Everyone invited could feel important and loved by him," recalls the top model, who started working with him during the Paris Week of High Fashion in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Nobility Parade
Gravani's life is not the story of an obsession, but a truly restored love.
He loves people with good manners and better degrees and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was converted into a distinctive 70-metre-long arcade that offers a role replacement: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to observe the "municipality" of dreams that Valentin's masterpieces are wearing as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti wore on "Night" or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience mannequin shines names like Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norwegian, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascalo and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "can't be forgotten."
"I remember it perfectly.
It was pants, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the fall-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Nate Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity and great love of women, because she underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, make a lot of light and give "sparkles" to his face.
The proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first wore Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
She finally got to the end of the '90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino to celebrate at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with a ring on it, a corsage in it, and a top with no hangers on it.
It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has saved the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Pavel Greek in 1995.
In order to create these silk dress ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of various laces and a four-and-a-half-metre-long tow were needed four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents the milestone of the late 20th century top fashion, "return of high society clients".
Valentino dazzled over the years by an elitist "savoire-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honours in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated by the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulates as much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always been drawn to his splendor, calmness, groomed and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was brilliant, time left no trace of him."
If the princess says so...
Hardest craft in the world: Sulphur carriers in Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers in the area of the Indonesian volcano gamble with their life and health as they carry 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, it must rock every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gases escape from the inside of the Earth and when in contact with the air it goes into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, it carries them on its shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, but it takes over 40 minutes for it to rise at a turtle’s pace because it maintains balance and carefully reconsiders its steps so that it does not slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed from Kawah Ijen rocks years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they produce
When they're upstairs, they take a trip around the tourists who photograph them like they're monkeys in a circus, and they're tired of taking the heavy weight baskets that the mining company placed a little bit lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Because it is normally 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," Anto explains, who usually takes three trips a day.
It takes three hours for one journey and it is destroyed at the end, but it can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even if it appears to be a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it's three times what he would have made in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for coffee collection, and the salary for two weeks is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier who previously worked on Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risked his life three times a day in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur had already begun to take its toll on him, even though his face was protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases leaking from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than decent English.
This likable and intelligent young man with fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, and instead he does the work of a porter.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up at 2:00 a.m. every day because sulphur continues to come out at night and its characteristic yellow colour changes into blue and bright darkness.
Despite the darkness surrounding him, Anto goes into the crater and illuminates the path with a small lamp attached to his helmet and bought it himself with his money.
About 400 carriers on the shoulders of the basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mismanaged the production of sulphur due to cost savings, nor has it provided any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such efforts.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) from the photo supplement, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), is selected by park keepers from tourists arriving to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for humans," Madrusin objected, a robust 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assure us that he can work as long as possible, because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind turns unexpectedly and engulfs the miners in dense fumes coming out of the volcano, the miners are so bitter that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by weight baskets.
At the age of 53, an unainic who balances his basket on his back can load only 50 kilos.
Each day he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which then three trucks take a steep route between the thicket to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik claims and opens wide mouths, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons he is the eldest, thirty years old, he also earns from mining sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - crafts carried out by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore's looking for babies to save the economy
The Singaporens blame the fact that they do not have children, careers, stress, and cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the Menthol Candy ad, but yet - or perhaps that's why - the video has spread to YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses the local innuendo type "put the bun in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
BBH's advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The art director of Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music to fulfill his "civil duty".
"This is strictly a matter of the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We're the worst in the world to reproduce our population, so we felt it was a subject we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like spread perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, "Why don't we do the most creative thing possible, like the rap composition, to solve this problem?"
1,2 children
The one who doesn't take it too lightly is the Singapore government.
Each year, they spend $1,300 to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservatives of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don't the Singaporens have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Bureau of Population, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of opportunities in terms of life's goals and priorities, it is not just a wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of single people and postponing marriage and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
While there were efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this has caused displeasure among the local population.
Some Singapore websites show unhidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s government party recorded its worst electoral outcome since independence.
After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known implications for national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending, and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small flats known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had a great success in sales.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can support the bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, claims that their shoeboxes sell much faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular by selling them days to weeks faster than houses with larger size.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the birth rate of the nation, the conversation with Singapore’s financial district workers in the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are always stressed out, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people postpone it," says the young clerk.
"Let the others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old, young man.
Men and women refer to careers, stress, and cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, they are the Singaporens who have the last word on starting a family.
What is private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or "private life area that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption".
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would most certainly not tell anyone during normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriodico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely personal" and as "user name and password" when it came to social networks.
"I wouldn't publish my biggest secret," says ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice pictures or pictures of us playing on FB.
I'm talking to my friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would mock someone," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer, I'm just putting them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I am not afraid because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were leading him on or asking him for an address or phone number.
"If they push me or demand me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his Twitter recommendation.
This boy is not a stranger's experience with what is now called cyberbullying.
"A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't check out of the account.
"You just activated a private regime."
Then explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of acquaintances in awkward or awkward situations.
"Of course I'd do it if someone bothered me or if I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and a graduate in the field of Education and Teaching, believes that children and adolescents need to understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
He says: "The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a graduate of education at Yale University and author of the article Digital Aboriginals and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that this is a complex topic, 'because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not ready for it'.
Also, to be discreet - as far as the surroundings are concerned - at a time when what they desire most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do anything doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marjorie Porras lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, "Would you like someone to post your picture the way you posted your friend's?
You know what other people publish about you?
When you mark the persons in the photos from the celebrations, did you ask these persons for permission?
And one more: does everyone always need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to make them realize that they have to behave in the Internet environment as they do outside of it.
It's the same rules.
"Man is guided by respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet and should be the same on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, first degree teacher, and educational advisor explains the need for parents to carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If they understand every insidious thing, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences they may have of setting up an account on the Internet.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
The Guardia believes that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of 'do not talk to strangers'.
The South American Summit ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the Presidential Office, who at the outset stated that the document would be published after the summit, stated that it would later be published on the Peruvian Government’s website.
They also stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in a few brief press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, the video from the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "confidential meeting, audio transmission prevented".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present, but not by the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participating presidents, which led to the disapproval of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it was just a statement from President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, even though the press was eagerly required.
On the official ASPA website you can find out that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but they completely prevented the information from being supplied.
The summit ended, inter alia, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to the adoption of a judgment of the Hague Court which addresses the dispute over the border between the two countries.
President Peru Ollanta Humala and President Chile Sebastian Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin hearing the defence speech of both parties to discuss the dispute that Lima initiated against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful dispute resolution, conventions and international courts," added Piñer and greeted President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that the International Court of Justice was subject to a decision was published after Colombia had adopted the Bogot Pact this week, thereby expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court which decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely wrong.
The summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the withdrawal of then-President Fernando Lug and did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the morning speeches and closing the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and 31 projects between South American countries were planned, with $17 billion in investments.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries will take 'important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which residence agreements are extended'.
He informed that actions were supported to improve 'cooperation in combating civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap Internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters'.
When Europe is in crisis, "it does not have a winning essence (Latin America), but it is intended to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport connections between various places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries can be better connected and create new economic links," said the Peruvian President.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned a better connection with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday, to discuss with respect the International Court of Justice’s ruling on the dispute over maritime borders, which is being questioned by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, nor will the contract with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he emphasized.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to participate in the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
In the framework of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the area's defence.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country in question is currently excluded.
Peru is the provisional chairman of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on national television TV Perú that Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, the project defended the creation of South American citizenship, which the member countries of Unasur support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still backward areas that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The President of Ecuador has also said that he agrees with the regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who have signed the San José Human Rights Pact will be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is funded by the United States in Washington," he said in his reference to the political asylum provided by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles by it, and he respected his 'deep democratic values and human rights'.
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange might be released to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be questioned in Swedish territory for alleged sexual offenses, while "the Swedish legislation itself allows for a videoconferencing call that could take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa said that there was a risk that Assange would experience a deterioration in physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that he had minor pulmonary problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But his physical and mental state is at risk of getting worse, because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in fresh air.
This would affect everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that talks were held with London in order to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzon is conducting a series of proceedings in various European instances," he said.
He said, "If Great Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it'll all be over."
And if Sweden interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or through Skype, as the legislation there allows, and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be over tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press and made it clear that he certainly does not tolerate 'substandardity, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression'.
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, the mean and perverted politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither such journalists, "not bankers, nor hegemone countries nor bourgeoisies control Ecuador", and he submitted that if he was re-elected, "he will continue to change in the right direction and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay on Union membership of Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the whole 'must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and puchism wrapped up in legality', because it 'destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay' democracy'.
In addition, the President of Ecuador stated that he considered it "to be entirely appropriate" to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, after the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The sentence is not accepted at the moment.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed wide in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed his hope in settling the maritime border dispute that he was dealing with in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed his view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit themselves to accepting a judgment, however hard it may be."
In the context of the possibility of running for office in the next presidential election in Ecuador to bid for a third mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
"I have never been interested in much, but only political power can correct situations such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, I get the same thing.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madur, who says that President Chávez had left for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the state of the president," he explained.
Today, the head of the Ecuadorian state attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS Victims Today Is a Consequence of Late Diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning had struck me," the doctor said, recalling the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "relieve" a little, but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own, and he began to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most recent patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio lives with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from 22 years of age, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
At that time, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut".
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who don't know about their illness and don't come back until the virus has destroyed the organism and degraded the immune system and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases," says Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, who is a very successful patient who will start treatment in a timely and appropriate manner, says Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit in Guadalajara, and that this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
HIV/AIDS Infectologist and specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, better off are those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live for up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the person who is diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can "live without problems in keeping with the treatment up to 75 years of age", explained the doctor in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it should be recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and in Mexico the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNIDS/UNAIDS Joint Programme yearbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011 and by May 187 so far. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people continue to die from illness?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in terms of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens at the hospital.
The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or the late stage of the disease."
It adds convincing indication: "Nine out of ten patients come when there is an associated infection. All we need to do to influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore, on a large scale, it is necessary to offer tests to identify the disease to all those who ask for it".
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco, and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to get tests done at a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he had AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather go crazy three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for the better, healthy eating, exercising, taking medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I look out for myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who has accepted the call to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO daily, to motivate those who are afraid today as part of World AIDS Day.
"Let them do their tests, let them know if they're HIV positive as soon as possible, and if they've been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarises the motto of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a great gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is looking for information on HIV.
And the biggest gaps are prevention.
In places that are engaged in this task "the handing out of condoms has actually increased, they used to give us one or two, today they are giving us hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new diseases are teenagers.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question, full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and medical staff who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He suggested to change this ineffective distribution, not just behind the counters, but the 100 in the dispensers in the public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It is not support for promiscuity.
It's not even about "paying them beer and motel," as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex life," he remarked.
Key numbers in the State of Jalisco
13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV) were reported.
This condition means fourth place in new and detected cases of AIDS in Mexico and 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the disease is sexually transmitted, 6% of the blood route y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease for one registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt as set out in Mexico’s bankruptcy, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national undertaking with branches in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Thus, the procedures for restructuring firms that allow Mexican laws do not seem to apply in the land of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
On June 15, last year, the approval of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale at the North Texas bankruptcy court leaves Mexican firms without defense against the possibility of confiscation of their assets on the other side of the river El Bravo.
However, the verdict opens the door to the United States Supreme Court of Mexico’s leading glass producer, appealing against three irregularities.
First of all, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is set out in the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of the insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, a United Nations model law for unification of international trade law was created for this purpose, which is determined by the arbiter to the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of branches from the internal corporate structure, when Vitro’s parent company’s debt to its branches is recognised, the required majority would not have been reached to approve the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws admit this possibility.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples of Agremex and Comercial Mexicona, whose in-house debts were guaranteed by the Federal bankruptcy institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in a court in the United States, i.e. "supposers" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach the majority.
The vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.
That information shall not be taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of the serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company González Sady will appeal to a new assessment directly at the appeal court, so that the assessment will take place with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because initially only three of them voted.
If he fails here, he will demand, as an appeal, a revision of the process by higher instances, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case is serious that the court has omitted the document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae unit, in which Vitro’s procedure under the Competition Act is described in detail and points out that the company has facilitated itself by resorting to agreements signed by both countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States insolvency law.
Moreover, it points out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, that is to say, rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall assessment
A few months of criminal charges against the former owner of Gastón Azcarrag Andrad, who was accused of fraud, were on the table, and according to the pilot union, the vessel had already overflowed.
An instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction in the pursuit of justice.
In its view, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on a transaction made by that entrepreneur, in which it had selected 198 million pesos from Bank IXE of Fideikomis F/589 on behalf of the Mexican aviation company.
The funds were probably directed towards the purchase of the shares of Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Professional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of an association met at Universidad de Caribe this weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge trading and distribution centre with large-walled products focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees of 150 companies at the bottom.
Previously, Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has managed to unite the governors of the Southeast Zone to oppose a monumental area that would partially devastate the protected areas and which is the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of ACTA document matter
The Senate's request, which was not taken into account by the government, which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed the Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial) had lost its status.
As is known, this has happened despite the fact that the Senate itself has ruled out the possibility of treating it as a threat to the freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to repay long-term debts and not affect those short-term ones, the developer Homex places investment certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer interest repayments every 28 days.
Competival is born
By combining leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, a trade name Competival was born to market software services in Central and South America.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: " Basketball was my life"
Basketball world runner Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes had been passionate about this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a BSN national basketball league player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I have played a lot of roles in basketball during my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the National League of BSN, general manager of the National Team and the Federation President in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting reporters of Primer Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has been living with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest emotion of all, he guards those who resemble his work in Los Vaqueros from the mid-'50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"That was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to take part in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
That's when the team took over "Cuca" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and at that time worked at Alabama University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a two-metre tall player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to quarterback Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamona a victory in the championship, Gauss would contribute to the next."
He enjoyed the championship, where he played Gauss for the team, but only remotely, because in 1988 he had already served as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the Olympic qualifying match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up in the neighborhood, but we should have had bronze if it weren't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw," Reyes said.
Is the World Cup team in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we beat out a United States team that was pretty similar to the one that blew out the bronze for the World Cup.
This team had not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been on the team in 1990 due to knee injuries.
The team, which may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from Olympic Qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With the players on the roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players voted out because of the clash in the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was without a doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His international tournament numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his involvement in various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla very much from the young.
What is your greatest achievement in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s, the National BSN League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What didn't you have time to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like dividing youth categories by regions.
For example, that the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistants of referees and referees.
I'm glad.
What do you do now?
I listen to music the most, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman Died
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, world famous for John Ross Ewing's leading role, known as "J.R." in a television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of greed in the '80s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official announcement of the family provided to the Associated Press by the production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for cancer related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he liked the most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in the Dallas hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, entertaining, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," said Linda Gray in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and Hagman submitted to a transplant.
Years before the Dallas show, Hagman became famous on TV as a decent guy in a lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets an attractive girl (Jinnah), who Barbara Eden plays, and takes her to her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72), and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in films included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was up to Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star top.
The drama series of CBS about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Jüjár?", which was supposed to raise expectations about a work of emotion, when the character of Hangman was almost murdered, caused not only a huge series of spectators around the world, but also a risk of millions of dollars in the bookies.
This also helped this episode to achieve a record in ratings.
In November 1980, in which the answer was revealed, on average 41 million television viewers watched, Dallas became the second most watched entertainment program in history after the end of the broadcast of the MASH series in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) fired at J.R.
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a crafty businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to put his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) in rehab.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on screen and outside."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT several months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second row have already been finished and the sixth one has just been filmed," the TV station informed.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no announcement from Warner or TNT about how the show would continue.
Fort Worth native, Texas, was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as South Pacific musicals and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950 ’ s, Larry tried his luck at the theatre scenes in New York, and then between 1952 and 1956 he served in England with the Air Force.
There he met young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he published an autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm anyone," he told Prensa Associada.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take an end-of-the-world course this semester, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar that was due to come on December 21st, a lot of people were caught up as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was coming to him in the next few months: Catastrophe Hurricane Sandy, a budget gap that some call 'debted Armageddon', and the growing conflict that Israel is involved in, a place in which, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When a person discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we had 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for an apocalyptic thinker.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, the assistant professor Barry Vacer holds a course called "Incentives, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas spread with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and exploring how different they are from real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students of what is possible, likely, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an expert assistant in the history of art and anthropology, joined together to hold a course called The End of the World.
"We do not add "2012" because we always count on the possibility of organizing a course again in case the world does not end," Restall said.
Despite "threatful destruction", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the evening of the anticipated end of the world", said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He spread out within two hours," said Restall about his course for students with a high average who signed up for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we were asked by e-mail whether there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
So apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is simply a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of an hour in which this could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the end date of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with Maya's predictions and we are in some way disproving it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings by predictions of the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to flourish.
"Other people don't think about it," he said.
This is done in the vast majority of the English - speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at La Salle University, who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, answered quickly about a course on the end of the world.
"Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception to the Supreme Authority.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there was talk of many days of the final judgment, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will perish.
The dates are taken lightly by both students and professors.
Several have said that they intend to go to the "end of the world" festival.
"I'll probably call some friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year-old student of communication Samira Ford.
