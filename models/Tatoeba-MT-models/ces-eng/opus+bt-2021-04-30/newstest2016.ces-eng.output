On an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to arrive at their home.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at the house, and that contacts to a dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I am so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she is the only one who ever loved me," it said in a letter that the authorities said Lamb signed.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
The Chief of Police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fatal call on the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting, students and faculty were forced to hide behind locked doors, charged authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by investigators on the side of the state as well as by students and employees who knew him together created an image of a talented but likely troubled teacher.
Students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote in thanking "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with other 17 faculty members and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations in terms of problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed aggravated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, stated that Lamb told him that he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for leave for health reasons when he stated that he had some kind of problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard for would not guarantee him an automatic term to become an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge stated that he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb was apparently troubled by something."
Lamb won't answer these questions again.
After leaving campus, police picked up his trail crossing the Arkansas state line back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot from a gun in the yard of the house about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed by the Washington State Coroner, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began working at the University, which has 3500 students in the city, which number about 12000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
In the spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a clever, charismatic, and funny person.
Carla Hairston stated that she was 15 and Lamb's 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older boy who tutored her to play guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The hearts of all the girls reached as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the marriage record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the arm of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely down," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She was best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail went to the summer festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a savings-lighted bar near Gautier, said he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, pot that Lamb had finished playing guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We were giggling and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a killed professor, led a seminar in his first year and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University, Kansas, and was president of a boys' student club and the government of students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students, and community members, attended a candlelight reminder event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil during which the college choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
On Wednesday, school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge claims.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was adapted to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a call on an emergency call after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us declares that they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children's toys and products claims to give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, a decrease compared to 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will be recruiting staff during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily recruit employees to assist in shops and sales, for the dispatch and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was notable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre and waited for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming document, "Back in time."
The film begins, and I realize I'm within reach of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which lists interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It is truly the best travel document ever filmed for me."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russian accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions.
Once again, the UN Chief has urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said at a Wednesday press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly Ministerial Meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching Iran's nuclear crisis resolution agreement in Syria.
8 ballot numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to describe him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands at it like a joke gone wrong.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whether some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they fail (yet).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in charge of a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what it means for the nomination chances of this real estate mogul.
Of course, it is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, eventually neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into the general election.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth realize Trump's will to endure and begin to unload their dollars on the stand in order to overthrow him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the real estate tycoon is not just a fleeting phase:
Trump's favor assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was already 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers hold in the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "excited" or "satisfying" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 have stated that they would be "indignant" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "excited" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters claim that they would be "dissatisfied" or "excited" if Jeb Bush's favorite company became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his pompousness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to the idea that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the post of president, according to the Monday's ABC News/Washington Post vote.
The same number is held at the Iowa State Senators' Club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think he does not have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temper does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When he puts on his scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who most likely wins the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is a late July change, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete publication: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the run against 28 percent for eventual Mitt Romney nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Although Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that a fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll from early September shows that in a hypothetical direct duel between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always receive majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubie by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match one against one.
The bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made up their minds.
A new Tuesday's CBS/NYT poll shows that only more than half of Trump's supporters say they will not change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for change among candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign's notification speech, immigration has still been holding as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear Trump's pompousness will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage to rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post opinion poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the theme of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain too.
Frustration from the government is reaching a new maximum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are receiving roughly half of their support from Republican voters today, mainly due to their condition as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post Monday vote claim to want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa revealed a few weeks ago that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent being "disturbed" and 21 percent "peacefully angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state from coal charges.
The Czech Republic will raise more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the yield of fees from surface brown coal mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that they would receive additional money from both the Treasury and the municipalities' budgets.
The draft was criticized by opposition members who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House supported the government amendment of the Mining Act in the first reading, which, among other things, means that the State should receive a larger part of the yield of fees from surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
The state's share will increase to 67 percent, while the municipality's share will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating the payment for minerals that firms will benefit from.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, municipal budget revenue is to have a neutral effect as the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million from fees and a state budget of CZK 150 million.
From the extraction of lignite the municipalities went about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payment from the tilling areas with allowed mining to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities would receive between CZK 14 million and CZK 100 million each year instead of CZK 100 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Repayment shall be calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for each species of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government regulations may not be in line with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Only municipalities whose territory is affected by mining shall receive fees.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same ratio will also be in the case of radioactive rock mining.
Part of the money the State collects on mining charges will be purposely tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kadner (Osvit) elected in the Ústí Region.
Prior to the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned.
Kadner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the amendment to reject, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term agreed.
Therefore, the main consumers, such as power plants or heating plants, should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating expenditure, which would, above all, mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to it, the increase in employment fees is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on Milan Urban's amendment (CSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the law is passed.
If coal will be mined beyond limits, then it will have an impact on the yields for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit on the mine of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should break even for reasons of social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
The happy one will lead the Czechs as a number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Davis Cup Barage draw on the board on Thursday, and this time each of them will probably also intervene in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans that due to difficult conditions, he will spread the load over the entire quartet.
There is hot and high humidity in Delhi, so challenging matches are expected to stretch to up to five hundred.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it according to the weather.
And according to the way it will look, he said Navrátil in today's training of Czech selection in the center of Rajže Kumara Khánna.
With the number one team and the world forty Jiří Veselý counts on Friday and Sunday doubles.
Luke Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to turn around at the second position.
I'd like almost everyone involved.
I've got it slow in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It is just a question of who will stand next to an experienced deblist who has a 18:4 balance in the Davis Cup in the doubles.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There are options left with Rosol or Adam Pavlásk.
"I really don't know with whom and how it will look," said Navrátil.
It will decide on the development of the doubles.
Varianta can be Pavlásek, with Vesely surprised in the 1st round by winning in a deble over Australians.
"He's a decent son of a bitch," Navrátil said.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to perform the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I am glad for the experience and I would like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The landlord puts in the doubles of Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ranking), who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he defeated players third and fourth hundred rankings.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
They're both challengers, and my parents have experience in the ATP Tour, but we've been convinced a lot of times that the Davis Cup rankings don't decide.
"He decides the current form, the weather," said Navrátil.
Friday's opening doubles will start at 6:30 A.M.S. and they can reach out due to weather.
According to the forecast, it's supposed to rain and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it may be played under artificial lighting.
They've already lit it up, and it's got some 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," said Navrátil.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very enthusiastically expected
New job manager Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time he will have to collaborate with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will put the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he demanded "less theater and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the singing of the national anthem in service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the center of attention to several stories on the headlines of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention to himself
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would be "standing in respectful silence" and that he would acknowledge "the heroship of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight program that he would recommend a Labour leader to sing the national anthem "no matter" on his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, quoting differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work also "strow" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government's dose limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, stated that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The Labor Party leader, who promised a different approach to politics, claims to have ideas "from the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQs are too confrontational and that it will refrain from both "rapid responses," and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not participate — such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea that he would let other colleagues speak for him from time to time, because he let himself be heard that he still discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to divert himself from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later admitted he failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leadership of leaders, their leadership of the House and their position among other MPs, despite critics arguing that they have become a cartoon and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Phototion in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
Johannesburg Center is a hard place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and earn money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound rises while salary growth in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped on the following data and showed British wage growth recovery, while FTSE 100 was led above by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB profits including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and seemed to be approaching estimates when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% above the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped 20% after receiving a close-up offer from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and approach brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the rival group of luxury Richemont goods.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
Shares in Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said they increased by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in Mondi's packaging and paper group were the largest drop on the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating on the firm's "sale."
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports firm reported 83% jump in mid-year profits before tax £46.6m
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion.
The executive chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his company, he states.
The costs could affect the plans to expand JD Sports, adding, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building cheer the marshmallow.
Controversial construction got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will be appealed against.
Hundreds of people protested in front of the office of Prague in the vicinity of the Anez Monastery in the center of Prague.
The Magistrate stated in the decision that there was a violation of the building law because not all the requirements of the territorial decision were complied with.
"The zoning decision does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, distances from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clearly and comprehensiblely described the shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory affected by the influence of the construction," the decision states.
It also considers that certain documents for the decision were issued for the original documentation under discussion, which changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file that, however, the owner of the land only supported the consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not the consent to the location of the building on its land, writes the Department of Construction.
According to Francesco August Razett of the investor company, the construction department did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review had already expired.
Anyway, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which is nicknamed marshmallow due to the supposedly proposed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have met in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
The association and residents of nearby homes are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the construction for the historical center of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anez Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted on the glass facade, rejected the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) and revoked the permission of Prague memorialists in 2010.
The new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the SAO as well as by the city landmarks and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the opposition's complaints, saying he never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after a pink and white confectionery.
The Czech politician drove migrants.
Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees to the car, who were said to be carrying about a half mile [half km].
According to him, it was not yet criminal in Hungary, he claimed to Lidové noviny.
We knew that lawkeepers were not affected by such behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to an investigative custody in Szeged, he described the newspaper.
In the cell, the politician eventually spent nine hours.
The police said they were correct, but communication was difficult, because they did not know English very well.
But according to him, the prison was a sad one.
In our cell, for example, about three times four metres in size, 15 refugees from Syria were in distress.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked in there for the second day, and due to the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them, reported Berg.

On Friday 18.9. at 9:30 she will answer questions from readers answered by the president of the Executory Chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her about changes to the Enforcement Act valid from 1 September 2015 as well as other matters related to executions or executioners.
Metcash launches a rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from the strain of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches a rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers join brands such as Dunsborough based Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of his defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because southern and western Australia represent nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate a higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - over 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take up 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that took over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retail could lose 360 million USD at annual sales and Metcash US$250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in southern Australia and 30 in western during the next year, and will generate sales of US$500 and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed Metcash price base could cost it around US$13 million on pre-tax returns, confirmed by Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in Eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the latest poll by Roy Morgan found the buyers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass' fund manager, founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it's known that a board member of Metcash contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA fell from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and the earnings from the Metcash food trade, which it supplies about 1200 retailes of IGA, fell by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation, as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale went into counterattack and invest more than $150 million a year to balance counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, helping IGA refit shops by adding fast-growing food and news from privateers.
Metcash's executive director, Ian Morrice, claims that the pricing and retrofitting programs will catch the fallback and hope that the grand sale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a collateral loss in a recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, reports President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention to himself due to the affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then stated: "Wawrinka had one to stretch out to Kyrgios and I had to stretch out to him too."
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a spasm derailed Richard Gasquet's possible defeat at the US Open, Kokkinakis unwaveringly defended Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for placing in the second double behind Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I have been very intensely thinking about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the whole dispute," Healy states.
He destroyed the rocket when he lost because of a cramp in the US, but he's not the first player to take the anger out of his own rocket because of frustration.
But he really controlled himself very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a great deal of credit.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, works very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I simply think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios due to an important match that starts on Friday, stating that "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports a Canberry native to return to the team as long-term sticklers.
"First of all, we want our team to be totally focused on the match and not all the controversy that [Kyrgios] formed around it," Healy says.
And I think Nick was rising very quickly, as Federer, Murray and others point out, growing rapidly in the public's eyes, he also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time beyond the spotlight, when he will be able to think about it, is in my opinion the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who attempted to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants massed in no one's country, and Serbian authorities reacted outragedly.
Those who have been stranded for an unknown time on the belts of the country between two states stand those who run from violence in their native lands, building tents and settling in.
But here comes feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, migrants call together "Open the Borders!" and call the Order Unit of the Hungarian Police.
Some reject food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just indirect harm.
It will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries over the next few days," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The riots at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-state block did not come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement for another month or the end of the year, which would have been accepted by the EU peoples of more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called a special European summit on Tuesday for a week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not rely on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's threat situation in the two southern regions gave authorities greater authority to address the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases of asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correpondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped draw barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point to the European Union for Refugees, many of which have fled Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go for a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that clearly differs from other EU countries including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalise the violation of a four-metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also sets longer terms in prison for those illegally transferring refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," Zoltan Kovacs' government spokesman in the southern town of Szeged told reporters.
We are quite clear on this: illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, the parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army that was expected next week, but reporters Associated Press at the border have been observing heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an adviser to Orban for home defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 had already caught on state territory.
They penetrated through fence damage and are now in police custody charged with committing offences under new laws.
Authorities quickly had the fence fixed.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing near Roszke, chaos arose, as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and crowding of people arose.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands left outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's jump in front of Bernie Sanders dropped by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up on her lead.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (declined from 58 percent), while Sanders is ranked second with 27 percent (increased from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is to announce in the meantime whether he wants to become president, gains support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the main competitions began, the most democratic voters claim that it is too early to say that they are clearly the decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost ground under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton keeps a big lead between women and softens, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among the men declined significantly and Sanders lost only 5 points to her.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 has vanished and are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to senior voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is only losing 5 points to her in this group.
About half the Democratic primary voters throughout the country say that she would be enthusiastically supporting Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
I guess it's no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly passionate about her.
Views are mixed among those that currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the time it was time for a woman (13 percent) to be president, and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, the great possibility of electing and agreeing on problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential candidacy for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see a head start - a third thinks he should not run again.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, Biden was the most common choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, she listed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will spread from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely elective is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over greater chances of being elected.
Like last month, neither Democratic candidate or potential candidate performs as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have that opinion of him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As far as all these standards are concerned, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As the questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as a state secretary continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of her has not affected her at all.
But it's a whole different story among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on the subject were divided as early as March, shortly after the problem became apparent.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent of their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
It is mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their view of Clinton has worsened.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party voters, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, which is a drop by eight points from last month, and by 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush did best in honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't take an opinion on him.
The error margin for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national election
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest poll, and others are getting support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a overwhelming majority, and they climbed from 23% support in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well across demographic groups, excluding Trump among university educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and Ohio State Governor John Kasich, is behind together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the gallery from 10% support fell to the current 2%.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The most recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson improved and reached 19% support among Republicans behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to fire a blank shot at a retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning Trump's beliefs.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged with the death of a first-year Baruch College student
Almost two years after the student died during the overloading fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, she was charged with murder against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the initiation of the ceremony in September 2013 and the delayed took him to hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
Police officials state that he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the target through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 immediately after Deng passed out, and reportedly waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police claim.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the statewide president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, Police Chief Chris Vagner stated at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide equipment and basically preferred the well-being of brotherhood to the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with blunt force trauma to the head, torso, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overloading in fraternities and at least one student dies every year due to overloading since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible, and this action is important by the institutions.
The grand Monroe County jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with assault by overloading and criminal association.
"We want to detain not only the parties involved, but if there is an organization that approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will drive them to account too," Wagner said at a Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and national brotherhood abolished its relationship with local branches.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate growth will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it takes.
For the economy specifically, history offers a small factor about timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressivity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
This is why US central bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when tariff increases will start, but rather on trajectories as to how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss over increasing speed can be exaggerated.
"The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money era'," Julian Jessop, global economist Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more common but still low will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in about a month, the expected rate increase can make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for the re-sumption of shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's increase.
More precisely, the market has often been the most - about 14 percent - in the last 35 years - heading towards a rate increase in relatively flat in 250 days (mean increment 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal again after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the main stock strategist of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares tends to become more pronounced later in the tariff increase cycle and return is beginning to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rate increases often help her.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could hasten the recession.
Most noteworthy is that the gross domestic product near its lowest point in history while raising Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, only twice the nominal annual GDP increase was below 4.5 percent during the 118 hike since 1950.
Despite being 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, reports the Atlanta Fed.
The raising of rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question might arise, "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready to grow the Fed for a year, and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the increasing cycles have so far been in the super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this has clearly been a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those the Feds have waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still continuing.
The firm return was also volatile as the market expects rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what shares experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more evident on bonds than on shares when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rate increase will cause revenue to approach between long- and short-dated bonds with, which balances the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, though "we are still careful about tightening the yield," Kathy Jones, a firm analyst for fixed retirement at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, the credit spreads have expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, firms that conduct most of their business in the US win after an increase in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
Transnational companies with a lot of debt will fare worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market area, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of shares tends to overcome themselves within three months of initial rate increases," said analysts Goldman Sachsve in a customer report.
Companies with strong balance sheets outscored weak balance sheet companies in any interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital gains, as well as stocks with low volatility, also surpassed their counterparts with lower quality on average by 4 (percentage points), or 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates lose most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers also benefit from a growing dollar.
Sponsors can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "fooling"
He believes that he is becoming more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on the British
MP Damien Collins attacked Voice and says neither is he an original idea
BBC Radio 3 "changes" in Classic FM, claiming a leading MP and amassing fresh pressure on the broadcast to show that they are doing something commercial broadcasts are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio station seemed to be "abated" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'flammed'- but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that I can think of when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC's CEO rejected the charges with the justification that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3, I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and creating music is actually top-notch.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire due to treading on the heels of business competitors during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and got to hearing the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talp Media at an estimated £22 million price.
Do you see why this program is discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges shine - was made "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" next time he starts a fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending money on license fee payers on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have been growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 recorded a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since the records themselves began in 2000.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday might be the reason to stop spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise, making many British major streets ghost cities.
However, experts argue that there are signs of steady online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August has represented the lowest increase in growth since the very beginnings of the 2000 measurements, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of steady online sales, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level over the past years and go back to 2000, the given state has always rationalized over time," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, IMRG sales index editor.
It explains that Internet sales were reinforced three years ago when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to go away.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers might abstain from shopping before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times the average of buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and to knock down several vendors' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers are recontracting, can hold customers away from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was spent online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of a crane crash in Mecca and the Bin Laden family was sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred through the streets by Muslims in carrying out the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the design tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane crash in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the victims' bodies down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the grieving chose the path and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen got on his last trip to Al-Moaisse Cemetery.
The sad message passed past the holy place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and dropped on believers.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned the construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies 29 dead after the fall of the crane in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Haj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already promised that Hadj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman stated today that Binadine Group should not have left the crane's shoulder up when it was out of service.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state operated by the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but stated that the company's bosses were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims smith before the pilgrimage of Hadj later this month.
Binladin Group issued no statement of the collapse of the crane and were not made available to its representatives for comment.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort headed by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family was close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and run large construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in the midst of strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must undergo at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still staying in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be dedicated to relatives killed, and the same amount for permanently wounded.
The other injuries receive half of that amount.

Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do craftsmanship at their home, according to company chief behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for domestic needs, claims that the large increase in the number of Eastern Europe’s learned traders offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury claims that she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halfs.
At present, most are male workers.
She said that there is a need to address increasing demographic trends that depict more female households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says, "We still have men working in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% decisions about buying goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect equality between directors of men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among staff including the executive and financial director.
Mrs Laury argues: 'It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher announced a fall in both profit in mid-year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing the stores.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of straight stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS MP Zbyněk Stanjura noted that a one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard adjectives, because it would also be reflected in the next years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), according to which the next year was to be indexed beyond the law.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which, according to her, is not pink.
The higher ad valoremization next year would, according to her, mean a budget impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (CSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorisation had decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
In this right, the payout in December will greatly complicate and perhaps even make it impossible, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore, proposed a reduction of the deadline for the committee to discuss the standard for ten or 20 days, even blocking the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to go mainly from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs budget.
In the next year, pensions should increase by an average of about a hundred crowns.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be given to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply for a bonus in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions are regularly indexed in the Czech Republic as of January, namely by price growth and a third of real wages growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, the next year should be 44.5 percent.
The state spent CZK 314,7 billion on old-age pensions last year according to the state's final account, which was roughly five billion year-on-year more.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full retirement pension last year, according to data in the state final account, increased by 104 to 10.714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided payment of 2.4 million full retirement pensions and roughly 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin left plans for a political career, will pursue science.
According to Russian media, the Senate chair was almost certain.
On the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the Government Party of United Russia, defended his post in the Sunday elections with an overview.
According to Russian laws, senators are not voted by citizens, but selected by a governor from a trio of candidates whose names they announce before the gubernatorial elections.
After the election, he then selects a senator from the three candidates himself.
The complication was for Jakuna the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad area for twenty years, as required by the law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin to being an extraordinary and authorised ambassador to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The final straw in the chief hero's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law who ran out of strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janžurová decided about Grandpa's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to John that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He recalls that he once had his own will and dreams, wanting to live again with dignity and freedom.
He longs to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from it so far, said Slavík to the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedy form a kind of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning it was clear that the main role would fall to Bartoshek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Yet the actor, who appeared on camera after a longer break associated with recovery after a serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a smoky athlete.
He used to ask where he would sit before filming.
This time he rode a bicycle, climbed rocks and even went uphill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoshka, women marry tigers to make a rabbit out of him over time.
They'll pour him some fodder, but they'll close the door so he doesn't happen to think about playing tiger outside the rabbit farm.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie about. An actor commented on it.
His wife, who may seem slightly negative to the audience, portrayed Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurper, and she wants to take care of her husband to death, and he points out Bajgar.
The film parallels the fates of John's married daughters Olina and Alice - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the sons-in-laws Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben of Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US Internet company Google promised to provide up to another $5.5 million (CZK 332.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees streaming to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday Google.org, which is a charity branch of this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled Teličko's visit for criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the YES movement Pavel Telička postponed his coming Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled his official visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this by the EP resolution of last week, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička was co-author of.
By decision of the Azerbaijani Party Telička lost the possibility of interviews with official partners as well as a visit to political prisoners that depend on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive and representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, specified the text sent by ČTK.
The EP resolution condemns "unseen repression of civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadija Ismaila, who advocated the discovery of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the future Russian air base in Syria when visiting Novosibirsk.
We don't have plans like this yet.
But nothing is excluded, he stated.
Russia has an old naval base in Syria in Tartus port, which has been used more as a service and logistics centre so far.
According to reports from the Russian press, however, supplies of Russian armaments and military material to Syria have increased since early August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for the time being remains a bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, and American commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov about the situation in Syria on Tuesday; it has been their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will head to Moscow to convey concern about the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Assad's support from Moscow a losing bet.
On Russia's policy objectives in Syria, he stated that they were rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing rather a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria, according to today's speculation by the Russian press, is supposed to be the main issue of Putin's speech at the forthcoming meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York City.
On the contrary, the Russian leader is not going to talk about the situation in Donbas, Ukraine.
According to today's report, The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out President Barack Obama meeting the Russian president during a UN meeting.
But the views among White House advisors are said to be still divisive.
TASS today, referring to the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York residence.
Put sesame oil on the gallon diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from cold seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladders.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for cardiovascular disease prevention.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common reason for the death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are a fan of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipe for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used for heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in gallon diet.
Essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of gallstone formation.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
Generally, the problems with gallbladder concern particularly overweight people who do not sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used on a liver diet that is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits they bring to consume this oil, they should be careful of the goods from exotic food stores.
Asian manufacturers often use over-roasted seeds that have a more distinctive taste for pressing.
However, the oil will lose all active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, CEO of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice to Sokolov, which produces cold-pressed organic virgin oils.
The company also newly manufactures sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can print 8 kilos of sesame.
Mechanical pressing heats the raw material to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for marking extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, nutrition would be lost.
Sunflower oil benefits from heart and blood vessels diseases.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
From Jarmila Hamerská's research, which she led at Masaryk University, it showed that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, already at 180 °C it starts to overheat.
It is better to use it, for example, to season salads and is especially suitable in diets in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids lowers cholesterol most.
In case of heart problems, care must be taken about the amount of fat and calories received overall.
For example, there are 62 calories in one tablespoon of sunflower oil, 99 calories in the spoon of rape oil.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to note that natural foods with nutrients are far more appropriate than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower one lasts as much as the sesame and hemp for nine months.
Storage in the fridge will prolong the shelf life.
Old oil is especially known to people by bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no glaucoma at the bottom of the defect.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Cannabis oil contains the most healthy acids.
Since the seeds of technical cannabis belong to what is called superfood, cannabis oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be taken from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that daily intake of this substance is inadequate.
Men in France and Greece consume it 0.6 grams, while Icelanders accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Cannabis oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet for strengthening immunity and healing injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People need not be afraid of the use of cannabis oil, it contains no psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms that it is among the best-selling in Bohemia Olej.
It sells 500 grand a year.
People often use one spoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Cannabis oil is not tasteful, but excellently strengthens immunity, advised by Daniel Vlček of the karsl company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, Americans are the most passionate nation of barbecuers.
For one household, there's 1.4 grills.
All over the world, various barbecue competitions are held, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There aren't even Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in life have not grilled.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
To make the barbecue successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this while retaining beneficial substances during the barbecue?
Generally, in the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that much of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from dishes adjusted at lower temperatures.
However, it does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application during the barbecue.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When the meat is called, experts from Bohemia Olej z Kraslice in Sokolov will immediately equip themselves with grape oil.
It perfectly complements the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen features a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at this high temperature, Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Olej describes the benefits of grape oil as one of the few oils retains beneficial substances, which are among the few Czech producers of this grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil we also help increase our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, it is used in acne treatment and helps in the care of dry and broken hair.
Chefs appreciate the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for preparing cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for heat treatment of dishes.
Thus, two ways can be used during the barbecue, the marinating and the barbecue itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juicyness.
Three ingredients must be present in the preparation of the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we deliver the acidity with apple vinegar to soften the flesh.
Spices, in turn, gives meat flavor and oil preserves and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can penetrate through dark meat.
So the marinated meat or fish are ready for barbecue, how do we proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare the dishes.
Same goes for barbecues.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This concerns mainly flax, hemp and rape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling yourself, rub oil on the grate to prevent the burning of food.
Preparation of attachments is also an essential part of the barbecue.
For grilled meat and fish, practically anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, a hot summer salad.
You need: • 1 peach • 1 bundle of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of salad leaf mix • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add to the salad bowl a blend of lettuce leaves, chopped arugula, sliced cucumbers and large diced peach.
Salt and pepper by taste, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drip with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely sliced almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not just the drugs that matter, but the patient's will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of professionals: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example women with multiple sclerosis need consultations if they decide to have a child, care for these patients includes social legal advice, recommendations for housing adjustment, etc.
Yet all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he fights the disease actively, the longer he can work and may not fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors warn, the passivity of the patients releases space for disease activity.
For example, regular movement is shown to significantly delay the time when the patient needs a compensatory aid, such as a staff.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to different myths, such as that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That's why the "Give a Chance" page was created (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the saying twice that the disease will begin to be treated sooner is more likely to affect the doctor.
It's because we have medicines for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory stage when the process of neurodegeneration is not so strong yet.
The sooner we intervene, the greater hope is that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often resolves weakening of lower limbs or imbalance of balance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve gait, strengthen pelvic bottom, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific problems," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always ease its symptoms.
Movement activity, however, also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick are verifying what they can do, and that strengthens their confidence.
"The endorphins are also washed out during the exercise, and one feels good about it," warns PhDr. Kamila Řásová of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By affecting the physical side, we are acting on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the mental and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
"These patients have previously been spared, today we know they need a targeted burden," says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the University Hospital in Motol.
Physiotherapy is aimed at allowing a person to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including job classification.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to get each person a compensation aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it usually shakes people up.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With a sore soul like this, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to kidnap everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they eventually conclude that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the airbuses would not fly.
Air production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can't easily produce and process.
Still, next to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for shaping composites, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot stones.
In a drum that resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are rejuvenated in a pile of pits.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of Latecoere Czech Republic's air doors manufacturer.
In the grounds in Prague Letňany, the former Letov produces a complete door for Airbus A320.
They're the only ones in the world who deliver doors to 170 Brazilian Embraer.
Passengers also enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the largest air transport aircraft in the world Airbus A380.
There is also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
Maybe the moment keys are being adjusted twice a year by the company.
If the yellow sticker lacks a record of control, they should explain to auditors from Airbus or Boeing at the Prague plant who regularly go to see if the doors are manufactured according to agreed rules.
But the advanced technique has not yet completely replaced human senses.
There's 1,500 rivets on one of the A320 doors.
They must shake the rivets by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer, they'll know if the rivet's shaking properly.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet may rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
That's roughly twice the thickness of human hair.
It comes down to a trained touch during the check.
If the controller runs his finger over a row of rivets, he'll know if there's any outside tolerance.
Then he takes the exact spectrometer in his hand.
The Letov fed before 1989 a program of a training military aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, neither of them were made.
The firm had to find new jobs quickly.
That's when she got together with the European Airbus manufacturer.
She won a tender for an emergency door supplier for model A321.
Courting Boeing wasn't that happy.
"We were a small firm for them at the time that didn't have enough money to invest and to guarantee a long-term stable supply," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain locked if Letov did not engage the French group Latecoere at the 1999 Prague conference of the International Air Industry Association.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French started, says Dubsky.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
The installation of parts of the door for A320 started immediately in 2000.
Three years later, the upper deck door was added to the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new warehouse for composite processing due to deliveries for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten to these big jobs ourselves.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
Partners want 20 or 30-year supply guarantees, explains Dubsky.
Last year the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
The exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certifications and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't have made a door for airplanes.
To obtain certificates that production processes meet customer requirements, and in repeated checks to keep them worth millions of crowns according to Dubský.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and more stringent.
We have to train employees, equip the facilities and re-certified the whole process, adding Dubský.
Now the company is finishing preparation of the process for zinc plating and nickel plating, which will replace the harmful cadmium for human health.
Although they were commissioned by the manufacturer, they then had to adapt the technology to equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The Boeing people will come, check out the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results to ours, closer to Dubsky's way of controlling them.
The reward is Prague firm's long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant standing today, the production of EMbraers falls.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of doors.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for Brazilian or European manufacturers.
However, this does not mean that he could say any price on the doorstep.
The contract includes a price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece is still decreasing to a certain limit value.
We need to fit into this price formula.
If we don't, we'll lose, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where electric cabinets are assembled for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft, is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen is a new semi-robotic line for riveting and assembly of doors for the innovative model A320 Neo.
The riveting will accelerate and refine.
"This is the trend that the installation in aviation is taking," Dubský adds.
Sales have a future line secured.
Airbus reports that the airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Just a few meters away, there will be a line for the complete installation of the door for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision made by our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubsky.
However, before this, the company must pass the qualification tests, for example, to install some electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it can handle composites in addition to metal materials," Dubský proudly says.
Latecoere, however, reaches the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place in Letov, where it lives.
Prior to the French mother's entry, the firm had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and within three years, there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are overdoing how many hundreds of new aircraft are ordered each year, they may not be worried about work.
Although it has orders for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced a threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan payments.
Eventually Latecoere managed to deal with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she traded some of the loans to them for shares.
Creditors acquired a share of 37.4 percent in the company by raising capital by EUR 57.4 million.
The debt of the company fell by two thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of financial recovery came in early September.
The company subscribed new shares for EUR 222.9 million among existing shareholders.
In total, it raised core capital by EUR 280 million.
In doing so, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, who participate in the sales of 85 percent.
The average growth of orders expects by four percent per year until 2017.
In the order book, it has orders for EUR 2.6 billion, corresponding to four-year production.
The French media claims that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on IVs.
The Czech race in Prague Letňany is important for groups.
16 percent contribute to the group’s revenues.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The MPs supported a larger share of the state from the coal charges.
The change in mineral mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the Treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, municipal budget revenue is to have a neutral effect as the fee is to be higher.
In the previous year, municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million from fees and a state budget of CZK 150 million.
From the extraction of lignite the municipalities went about 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payment from the tilling areas with allowed mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told Members that the municipalities would receive between CZK 14 million and CZK 100 million each year instead of CZK 100 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
Repayment shall be calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for each species of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government regulations may not be in line with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral, which is state property.
Only municipalities whose territory is affected by mining shall receive fees.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same ratio will also be in the case of radioactive rock mining.
Part of the money the State collects on mining charges will be purposely tied.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair the damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The draft was today criticized by opposition MPs who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kadner (Osvit) elected in the Ústí Region.
Prior to the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned.
Kadner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the amendment to reject, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory report states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term agreed.
Therefore, the main consumers, such as power plants or heating plants, should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in remuneration by trying to reduce their operating expenditure, which would, above all, mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, according to it, the increase in employment fees is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on Milan Urban's amendment (CSSD), it is crucial that Members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before the law is passed.
If coal will be mined beyond limits, then it will have an impact on the yields for both the state and the municipalities, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit on the mine of the Czechoslovak army should not fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should break even for reasons of social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the American Federal Reserve
The whole world watches as the American Federal Reserve prepares to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists approached by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain dormant for a while and leave interest rates within 0–0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because the saddle has passed for years since the Fed reduced rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get off the zero bar and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of Peterson Institute for International Economy.
The US economy was doing quite well, recovering in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared for an increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this move.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00 CET.
Shooter at Delta State University left a note
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later the same day also his colleague - wrote a note saying that he was "sorry" for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back, revealed on Tuesday by government authorities.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, reported that Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at around 10:00 a.m.
and said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police officers to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night, ” and he also mentioned that there is a “cute dog ” in the house who“ will not bother anyone, ” but is upset.
The police demanded the names of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also failed to explain why shots were fired at the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of a 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb stating: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving a note, Lamb embarked on a 300-mile journey to Delta University where he killed the history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Dean of the University William LaForge said he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was obviously something going on in Mr Lamb's head.”
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb reportedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities stated that there was no "no evidence" about the "merciful triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, stated that she was a "great person".
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shaking" the entire case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as stated by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from her home online.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives Monday and said that he would not "go to jail".
When the police caught him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the school's website, Lamb earned a doctorate in education from Delta University in spring 2015.
Stars Who Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett due to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for possession in 2008.
Surely all these things take their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture during the Manchester United defeat at the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this injury in tears and knocked him out of play for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound caused a reckless Héctor Moreno procedure in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw snuck into the PSV space.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and also needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day and then further operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 years old has it very hard, but he plays fantastically, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture takes six months of treatment and won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he'll still play this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their reports, words cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation for recovery in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Coco, PSV coach, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponents, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," he said.
I haven't been able to see this moment.
I only saw a ball pointing in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview for SBS6, Moreno stated, "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long for them to learn almost by heart.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
Upon asking the child scheme provider to name a favorite children's book, he chose Prime Minister Lorox, a 1971 Dr Seusse fable.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report published on SuperCamps' website and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with strong content, such I liked to read to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had never seen before."
Well, except in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the story of the book according to the 2012 film lift, which added other characters and details to fill out a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville flanked by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to acquire the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is the brief content of a book that records the object of love unknown to Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodore Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it were not suspicious enough itself, the text supplied by Cameron is read as a summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words, "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of a girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Since he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the history of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being destroyed by a rabid, tree-cutting industrialist Once-ler, who despite protests by the title Lorax, a crouched, mustached creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, so relatively little significant PR task was given to a helper who never read Lorox to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesman said the text probably came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was threatened by England's omission, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team that England selected for this tour, I think repeating the 3–0 defeat she suffered last time in the test series will not be very likely.
I wouldn't rule out the winnings.
Alastair Cook's party may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting lineup and also collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the 2012 scars, only youthful positivity.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test series level, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to ignore Adam Lyth is a tough one for me to analyze because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the tough reality is that cricketers are judged by performance.
For example, there were no questions about the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I mentioned earlier — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not entirely 100%, and I'm not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much time a batsman gets to show up is a tough one.
Lyth got seven caps — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton earned nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outdoors.
The only thing you could complain about is that England gave Jonathan Trott first a chance in the Caribbean — even though Lyth was in the best form — but this wasted opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a batsman I value very positively.
He's an x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, was raised and I have no reservations against her.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't launch and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 to them, and there's no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played first his first 38 exams before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded for three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, I was impressed by him as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a pram, but there are not a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors chose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for test matches can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing men who bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and merciless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, although they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes was given one day off, as was Root receiving a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not make a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts stagnant by 2017.
David Cameron's unimaginable renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting into further trouble with every past day without electing the genius Jeremy "Is It Yes or No?" Corbyn is leading the Workers' Party, or will TUC take on the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they didn't want it, even if they were to undermine social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home with the words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to get into himself an unbiased Britain in Europe - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before becoming bad for her, as was the case for too long-lasting Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their legs in helping the Selfies of the British who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan purposely useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, says a friend.
"Renegotiation solved problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU are press oligarchs because they were not inspired by Tony Benn during a referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, a sneaky Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur for "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-free scoundrels, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a rabid gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't put you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair conceded to the principle of an abolished EU constitution that was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a firing card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he had no time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting the boycott strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, whose seat he left at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, I say it nicely, evolving.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the furious Ukip tendencies and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
The same thing Hilary said "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout could not decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment as the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" -- Benn's phrase -- apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the report remains important in the ages of the day-long television transmission and especially in the vortex, the hotspot of paranoia and betrayal, which are social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to take the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic squirming about EU membership - in line with their Bennite besieging economy, an anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his squirming about Nato - Tom Watson believes that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - for Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the British 'weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the Monday launch of something called the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticise the electronic review published by Public Health England
A statement by the government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have connections to the tobacco industry, reports researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency released a "limit" report last month and described it as a "complex review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned data complexity and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet professional magazine last month attacked a "exceptionally flimsy base" on which the PHE agency based its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for BMJ disputed claims that were reportedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They state that the public could expect the PHE claim to be "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to produce an analysis of the multi-criteria (MCDA) model's decision to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO allegedly had previously raised funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approves the BAT public health mandate in the sustainability report, states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not funding that it reportedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they supply.
The reason for choosing panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim industrial financing in the newspaper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
A report originated in this group "excusably admits," missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, stated that claims in BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifetime smokers dies because of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows, and also what they do not depict, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die a year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By emphasizing the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end up with EastEnders, claims former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "put their right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of another British television broadcast.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that would probably only follow a handful of people, into complex broadcasting times compared to its rivals "the largest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to connect with the BBC for six years that he worked on Channel 4.
"I fight the idea that the BBC is entering and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the Communications Commission in the Upper House, as part of negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you retain licensing fees, which I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, production should be reduced at least as regards programs that are not produced or commissioned by others.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, senseless.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without donation.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on domestic soil.
To be honest, other channels would give their right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty of catching up on ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the most popular BBC show repeats those that former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more pampered BBC public service programs "passes to BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured, but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they are going on their hypocritical £4bn mission to justify £4bn income from licensing fees, "But of course we do all these obscure programs that no one is looking at."
They air them at a time when no one's looking at them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the commission, "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think 150 British pounds a year is a large sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don't watch the BBC so much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director, David Elstein, who performed before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithov mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should take as a model public broadcast in Australia and Canada and turn into "informed, clarified and entertained."
On the subject of partnership Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast on television by only a handful, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenics", or brain cell control using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the tubers move.
Scientists raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inhearable to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have stated that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, reported for the Guardian daily that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are injected into the patient's brain. The method is used, for example, to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms.
The tubers usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction would occur when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, bubbles amplify ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of the worms.
Reinforced ultrasound waves act in the ion channels TRP-4, which is found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are associated with, reports Nature Communications magazine.
In order to control the tubers using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then used ultrasounds on such modified worms, sound waves were reinforced by microbubbles and transferred to worms where modified motor neurons switched on.
In many ways, the new method resembles optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light.
Chalasani, however, let himself be heard that sonogenics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without limitation and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
An illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisers embarrassing British arms trade.
Take a look at the video about the anti-weapon market from Amnesty International.
Threatening killer drones!
Leg chains that break ankles!
Scattered missiles!
And electric stunning batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
A cheerful voice and cartoon of metaphors leaves no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International due to highlighting the willingness of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security facilities of the International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with posters emerging at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important announcements, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using fonts with London subway signs with DLR lines becoming a picture of the tank.
This September, the swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
The collective called Special Patrol Group has helped distribute throughout London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen key, which reportedly "gets access to about a third of the commercial space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists increasingly question and try to show political activity to spectators outside the galleries.
Many artists switch to working with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another one of the posters against gun trade health passengers in the subway.
The video Amnesty was viewed on Facebook by over 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP working without entitlement to a fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
Creative VCCP director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding gun trade ads - saw an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate commercial, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, I achieved that it would attract more people."
"They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about selling illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we now need is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from the inside of ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army on "on the arm of the AT4CS RS launcher."
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
11 years ago, I moved to college as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I bothered - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the tracks can move from slightly on the nerves to completely appalling.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what do you think of Corbyn, and why "you don't honestly love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It runs the conversation and helps you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't have fun with even if your eyelashes were on fire and they'd issue fire extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, film evenings and communal public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college come in short.
Your room should be a haven, yet many dormitories are turning into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, social, and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
A boy in my dorm used to have a habit that if the door isn't locked, he's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with the baking.
Because you started going to university on top of a baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and performing with a plate of baked cakes seems slightly less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I'm asking personal questions."
Offering homemade snacks is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you and may end up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
Of course, that's the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and stiffness will probably interfere with others pretending to sleep if you try knocking on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Stealing an entire chicken is, of course, a crime, but is a drop of milk into your tea stealing?
Double check with the owner of the milk.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're furious inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more maturely than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little bit, because it was 3 at night and she had a test in the morning.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When they finally quieted down at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours and then turned on her own music, locked the door and left for her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same dorms as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and maybe she'd take control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you can't command your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future wife, try to talk a little bit to your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and entertaining lesson about their security by hiding something for them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never put their things on the ceiling more than twice.
Eve was looking forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had had a rough time in her pregnancy with a seven-year-old Vítek today.
His father broke up with her, and the offspring was alone to prepare and raise.
I dealt with the situation quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the child and I was looking for positive things in it.
I tried not to worry about the uncertainty and being alone with the child.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for long, today Eve recalls her first pregnancy.
She already met on the Internet at the cabin of older Vasek, with whom they began to talk about favourite films.
Vašek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the hospital, but he did not get too involved in the role of stepdad.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The theme of the third series of Czech television is the search for happiness on the second try.
She managed to take care of Vítek and the financial security of the family thanks to part-time work and much help from her mother and help aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child eventually did not spoil Vashkova’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítek's second birthday, and he now understands Vasek as his father and calls him so.
Although Vasek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys fatherhood at 60, according to his words, and he also devotes himself more to children.
In addition to Vítek, two-year-old Leonty and finally twins were added to them.
"Vashák entered our family in a kind of natural way, perhaps even by the fact that my mother never talked much into relationships with me," Eva thinks.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by Caesarean section after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of gallic acids, which then occur in excess of the amount of pregnant blood and are mainly manifested by itching.
The disease is dangerous to an unborn fetus that threatens premature birth and death, most of the mother's after birth will pass away spontaneously.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eve and Vashkov's happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks of age.
Emička was placed in the incubator at the intermediate department, where Vašek's niece works, who managed to take her and accommodate her.
Elinka was larger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had her with me, describing the difficult period after Eve gave birth.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until doctors agreed to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
However, waiting for children to be recruited in the hospital did not please Eve.
"I was crazy about my husband and children," recalls the difficult moments in the six-day ward of a quadruple mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, including due to the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, this did not happen, and doctors released Eve and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births air CT1 on Tuesday night at 9:45 p.m.
Quite a large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with the electric double and cramped conditions.
Although the house did not grow larger, Vasek made Eva happy by installing a gas cooker to make preparing food for six people more comfortable.
If it's the worst, we'll take turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children especially perceive family well-being and pleasant atmosphere, not the size or rejuvenation of the house.
For now, we've folded very nicely, better than we expected.
Although the mess is harder to hide in a small space and sometimes we cross the baby's rolling, but at least we're all close together, Eve smiles, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Vasek's work as a lighter for the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he occasionally goes out to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In her 60 ’ s, according to her words, she physically manages the care of the finances of the family and children, but how long will that be?
"I realize that, given our age difference, I will one day be the one who feeds this family," admits Eva in questioning the future.
She would like to get back to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
I'm not much of an employer with four kids.
And when it gets worse, my husband and I can take turns with a cab, joking like a nice blonde.
Apple had a yo-yo effect.
It's all because of the displays.
A more powerful processor, a camera with greater resolution, a tighter chassis or a display recognizing the strength of touch are in short the advantages of the recently introduced ninth generation iPhones.
The two last then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The trend of Apple to date was that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous generation.
Exceptions were only third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the advantage of the news was really negligible.
However, this is far from true of the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams in the smaller model, then by 20 grams in the larger model.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair of bending in Apple's pockets greatly bothered.
The new piece is thus made of a more durable aluminium alloy of 7000, which also reflected on the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology for the news, which makes the display know the strength of touch.
To do this, the display had to be provided with another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of displays of new iPhones thus increased more than twice as much compared to previous generations.
In the case of a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
For iPhone 6s the display is the hardest used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this news thanks to defatting cortex, which touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, the hardest used element of the battery is, however, its weight has not changed compared to the predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident in the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As practical as the new display technology is, it will only be displayed when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday 25 September, when sales of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Have the breakfast of champions been for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists succeeded in finding a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by a modern man from different times, including murals, tool residue and so on and so forth.
In a layer of 23A, which according to instruments dating back about 30,000 years ago, scientists discovered something very reminiscent of the leftover breakfast buffet.
In fact, there were traces of oat grains at the site, which apparently went through the production process of today's popular flakes.
With it, the grains are soaked first today, then dried, removed from the cover, called the plough, then spat and dissipated flat.
In the Paglicci Cave, grains were discovered that were apparently heated or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least the traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists could not prove in their publication for the magazine PNAS that there was a complete process of making flakes in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and possibly even warm is, of course, very logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before agriculture was created.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes overtook agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station reporting at the Brno City Transport Company.
So once again, I listened to the name reports on the trolleybus: Ugly, Spectre, Frazova, Bratecký.
Of course, the trolleybus was somewhat noisy, so the announcement by the male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops were reported by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of the traffic is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that passengers themselves chose this announcer - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly chose this from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different than in bus engine noise.
I've been living in Brno for a couple of decades now, so I know the proper names of all these stops by heart, so I don't need these reports, but foreigners who don't know anything else in Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended may be confused and may claim that the stop they were supposed to take was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of announcer - but better again the announcer - should be done again, and this time colored with common traffic noise and engine rumble, in which the whimpering speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we don't have to listen to the names of the stations Water Heršpice, Smirova, or then the Submarine in the creaking shalina to which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't suddenly get so bad on the one day that the announcer changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports pretty well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From track record.
Today, few people know what the party's biggest and smartest controls were so-called comprehensive screenings.
I took the liberty of remembering.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the minute the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't run into the comrade chief, came a minute ahead of you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," said dispatcher while I was enrolling in the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Tell me I'm going down the precincts to revise a little mechanization.
That's not gonna work. There's a background check today.
They're all fucking sick of it.
What's going on?
"You'll see," the dispatcher smirk.
Next time, you will be, too.
I ran out into the hallway.
That's when the head office door opened and the chief showed up.
Tight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of the jacket of uniforms.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran up to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone the old answered.
"You're playing," was greeted by engineer Eva, an elderly lady who I respected very much.
She said she was even chief before the comrades deposed her.
There's background checks, and you're just about to arrive.
How many times have I asked what these comprehensive background checks are, but nobody wants to talk about it too much.
They're supposed to be once every three years, everybody has to go to them, and it's very unpleasant.
At least for some.
He says I'll see.
I pulled a gasket out of the drawer with periodic reports and then a phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," the chief's voice echoed.
What's he bothering?
We just met and nothing..." I muttered, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I've come at your command," I said, "I've entered the chief's office.
The chief was sitting behind a desk looking through some papers.
"Mechanizer Comrade," he said after a while, without raising his head and still looking carefully at the paperwork, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the card on the table, leaned into the back of the chair, and leaned on me with the usual, unpleasant, mean, prickly look.
I was insecure.
What's going on?
Yesterday, he commended himself that in those few months in office I worked very well and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did a very good job of pulling me out of the distancing squad.
And now this?
You realize you're a track distance engineer, and you have to act like one.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stuttered that I've used such a greeting since I was a kid, that I was raised that way, and I don't see anything wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
"You're on the Socialist Railroad and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," the smudged chief.
Plus, you're still confusing the superiors.
One day you say "sir" and the next time you say "sir."
But I'm not your chief, I'm your comrade chief.
The deputy officers are comrades of the deputy, the chief linemasters are comrades of the chief linemasters!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and that honor of work, or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your privilege that you're not in the party," the chief said coldly, calming down a bit in the meantime.
We'll talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have that chair upstairs for retirement.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good with the guy.
For a while, he stabbed me with a cold, prickly look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also upset about his condescending name-calling.
He was only a few years older, and he was acting like a god, actually a comrade of God.
Jewish, pompous, authoritarian, arrogant, how he could use it right now.
He's been blown off by everyone.
So be it, he's the chief.
Actually, not all, the chairman of the party organization called him as all parties, but also non-partisans.
But the chief used to call many, especially those with whom he could assert his superiority.
He just wiped me out for total bullshit.
I thought of something about an ass, and it cost me enough to not shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back on a long road to the pickaxe, let alone continue to be a railroad clerk.
What would I make two kids out of?
And a built-up house!
I was in tears, but I was in control.
I'm not going to make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," ended the audience chief and began to look carefully again at the envelope he had in his hand earlier.
I was summoned at 11:30.
Everyone in the office was already there, and the questions about what and how, they answered, "Yeah, it's gonna be okay."
Only Jožina bitingly said, as was his custom, that they could not fire us all, because the work would have to be done by the comrade chief himself with his faithful, and that there was no danger.
The word "cohort" emphasized as if he knew what the old man had wiped me out for this morning.
There was a nice reunion at the chief's office.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table other comrades who were to decide my official being or not being.
Kadrovák, Chairman of the ROH, HR reporter, special-purpose clerk, some kind of military conspiracies, and deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from a long drive.
An ordinary track worker, beaten the sleepers or pitchforks tossing gravel.
But also a former guard.
Rumor was he was no fun at the time, a pretty beast.
Evil languages claimed the school was out in seventh grade, learned nothing, learned nothing.
And when the prison got cancelled, he ended up on the trail at the picker's.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief instructed me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unspoken pinecone in my throat.
Kadrovák read the opinion from the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids, et cetera, et cetera.
It's okay so far, I thought, and I've been breathing a little bit better.
Then a report from the street organization of the party.
He copied the opinion from the Citizens' Committee, perhaps both were written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of longtime party members, refused to appear before the vetting committee and subsequently stepped out, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief took a sharp look at me.
The cadre noticed and stopped reading.
The chief instructed him to continue.
It's only gotten worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and there I was won as party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who stepped out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and besides the national committee, I had a wedding at the church.
I failed the party's trust in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
Both of my children were baptized, and even when my mother died, I sent out a church burial, although it was a former party member.
All of this shows a negative attitude toward the party’s leading role.
When the cadre finished reading, only tapping the chief's pencil into the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was far away.
I kept saying to myself, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmith?
I could've fixed the switches without a fucking background check.
But now?
The railway official's career was taken over before it started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think so. I'm sure the chief will fire me for an hour.
" Comrade, how did you examine the comrade here?" interrupted the tense silence of the chief with a question to the cadre.
Well, according to a previous job report.
Do you have it here?
Apparently, the cadre wasn't two times.
On the crevices of sweat, nervously winking, as if he himself had been vetted.
He nodded fervently and handed some paper to the chief.
"Well," said the chief with a hint of journalism, which, however, often used to be a sign of thunderstorms.
At first glance, all praise, learned with honors, studied industrial science, worked in task wage as a locksmith, fulfilled the standard on average to 120 percent.
But the important thing is missing.
Where did you get that opinion from, comrade?" he turned again to a cadre who felt it was somehow beginning to turn against him and that he might not be a cadre very soon.
The comrade here gave it to me when I came in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct in the platoon," the cadre wailed.
And there's no evaluation required, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So this piece of paper was enough for you to enter the technical function," said the chief.
The cadre stared nervously and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss this later," concluded the chief and apparently relieved the cadre.
He's made it for now.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden he's calling me out, so that's it!
My eyes were dark, my eyes were hot.
There was a flood of regrets and accusations, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world who didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That by planting an incomplete opinion, I misled the comrade cadre officer, and I did not understand why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from the cadre in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at a time when real socialism is being built, promotes the reality of religious obscurity, indeed, even participates in it.
That, that, there was a lot that I had done, or maybe I'd still commit, and I quietly prayed for it to end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I jumped out of the place of a mechanic.
I didn't care if they took my pickaxe.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the comrade chief.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the party's chairman suddenly called and cut off the chief's levities.
The comrade here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he's done!
But he's already got his sentence!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than closing the door to his side for a while!
To be reopened to him, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is again worthy of our trust.
An ignorant guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he so read or parroted the phrases from party training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade has to get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's gonna give it to him if you don't, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty that no one can take away from you!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one said a word.
No one expected such a turnaround.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief iced in his attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's the conclusion I was making.
Everyone was nodding their heads in agreement, but they showed that they didn't believe a word of it.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate custody officer," I shrouded when I returned to the office, and then I cried.
It's a good thing everyone had lunch except for engineer Eva.
She was silently listening to my incoherent portrayal of fresh experiences, and in the meantime, I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the cooker and prepared cups.
Meanwhile, she was talking about cadre practices.
How one judgment, often full of praise, puts a man in the hand, and the other, in which there is every filth, they send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on the trail at the picker's, so the comrades at the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
All he cares about is what he ate or drank, and that's how it turned out.
"He'll get it from the old man," she remarked maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Look out for him anyway, he's very vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a much worse chief, no humanitarian.
Zero from a pickaxe with a lot of power.
The coffee water started to boil, and then the office filled up with the smell of just watered coffee.
I threw a sugar cube in a cup, and quietly mixed a hot potion.
I hope I'm out of the woods.
Now I'm not getting fired, and the next background checks aren't for three years.
Anyway, the comrade chief is not going to forget this day.
It was published in the anthology of LITERATS on TraTI II in EPIKA publishing house
The symbol of the village has come to life.
The wheel of the windmill over Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from afar because it is located at a 50-foot high mast.
People around here call him "the wind on Chlum".
For the municipality, 150 residents even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem that the municipality acquired on the occasion of the 2010 native reunion.
"We applied for a sign at the time, and of course we wanted to have a fan on the sign, everyone knows it around," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds of the time when people here were fighting for good drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
It was not until 1910 that the Chum representatives decided on a solution that then suited up to the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch on Čechov, they dug a seven-metre deep well.
Three years later, they added a metal structure with a wind pump, which drew water to the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc of Hranice, Moravia, with a cost of CZK 2,400," says the commemorative inscription on the ground floor fence of the mast structure.
The pump after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, a new chapter in the fight for water began to be written: on that day a new water supply began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
The Dominant was put into operation at this year's native reunion.
It was not until 2008 that Chlumšský decided to repair the wind wheel again and put it back on track.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but still the same year it had to be brought down.
The replica manufacturer did not choose suitable material and the wheel could not resist gusts of wind.
Then the chlum dominant rested under the roof for several years.
As of this June, however, the round on the high mast has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the reunion of natives, the village had the replica of the wheel modified and re-placed it at the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws utility water from the well only to the ambushed blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely shut him down because there was little water in the well.
At least it was spinning in vain.
"In autumn, we will disconnect the shaft of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel has reached the village emblem, but is the only village of this kind in the whole Highlands.
They have a similar element in the emblem in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in Vyškovsk, in Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovice in Přerovsk and in Police in Vsetínsk.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, she admitted the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, even my goal, like everyone else in my career," smiled 34-year-old Goian at a pre-game press conference.
George Hagi coached us back then, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I can score Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This very man who played 60 games for Romanian representation is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stoper, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says of the Greek duel Spartan Hybsh.
And he has some idea what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fatai, who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good striker, which is why he went to Sparta too, Goian said.
Another footballer did not name the Prague club, so the direct question came whether he knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and aimed at Czech journalists with a slightly reproached view.
The clueless look on his face marked, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a while, the silence went off.
We saw some videos, and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from larger clubs, one can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such their game organizer," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has been through the best years, but he boasts a very interesting football biography.
Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steauy headed to Palermo, Italy, also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We expect aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European Cups, fighting for victory in the Czech league.
For me, he's a favorite in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group off with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, said Goian.
I am in the room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very excited about the opponents from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola should have a new seat in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to the trading of shares in the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The actions we have taken so far within the project are mostly legal and administrative and do not have a factual impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry to the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the prospectus of the security, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating in it.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or new investors under this operation.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016," the firm said.
The firm has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
A test of the objectivity of Czech television in information about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of coverage of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news session of Czech television.
And how did she stand up?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's broadcast of Czech Television Events.
The migrant crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the news broadcast.
Except for the first minute, when CT informed about the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers, it called them euphemistically out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current propaganda was already going - judge the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticize mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Travelling Refugees - CT consistently uses the terms of a refugee or refugee and not a migrant.
What is surprising is that CT uses only and only small children and women in illustrations.
In doing so, she herself stated on the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part propaganda that is unprecedented from communist agitations.
I must say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once rose to a fancy apartment, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I moved my fishies into the umacart bathroom.
Fishes of the domestic species, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not undergoing the transformation from caterpillar to beetle and cub looks like an adult individual, it is just tiny and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't lean on them to kill them.
First by hand and later by chemical.
The socialist drugstores provided some sort of blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Cycle B.
Or something else?
However, it successfully disposed of them.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs similarly.
With a box of a sort of juvenalizer, which the ants brought to their nest and he then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But that's where I left off.
As time went by, insects became an object of my admiration, and I was increasingly inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have taken away from my life the experience that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
The truth about fleas and bugs, I wouldn't hesitate to make my karma worse by killing them.
In the new homestead, my partner and I agreed that if the fishes don't stick to our necks, that they should eat crisps of fallen skin, some invisible algae, and so on.
Their peaceful existence over time was disrupted by a spider.
He was a common kind of mercenary who had long resided on the ceiling.
We thought he was living off occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he feeds mainly on fishes and that their numbers seem to have kept in bearable numbers.
By intimate regular contact with each need we found it to be a female.
We witnessed romantic courtships with a partner about a third smaller, as he carefully quills on web fibers, so that he would not be eaten before reaching the desired copulation.
It lasted about three days when they were not moving or responding to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried-up male next to the female.
Then the spider wouldn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by a number of small spiders hanging in different places around it.
Soon they disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother, part of them fled elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
If she went elsewhere or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the original toilet owner.
For some time from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-aggression as a friendship.
In turn, the numbering condition of the somewhat propagated ponds declined, and the spider calmly observed its routine activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed for a year.
In the meantime, our daughter grew to an age when the use of the potty was already a disgrace.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've had enough of it to spill it forever.
We urged her to use the toilet more and more strongly.
However, the daughter found an excuse to maintain her habit in that spider, which she saw very well while wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider didn't take any chances in the house.
Crying and screaming, she forced her potty.
There was no need.
There was a time when a spider had to command himself in the interest of developing a daughter's displacement.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished across the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said good-bye to him as a friend, but I still felt awful after living together for so long, like I was firing a relative.
We assumed that the fishes would start appearing more often and would start multiplying by a geometric series.
It's a wonder, for a week or two, we didn't see any of them.
I started to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider, like ants, had grown them somehow, that the environment of the toilet wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first middle - size pieces appeared, and they were swarming again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their ties to the spider must have had a reason for not seeing him hiding in some other place, and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection to their predator and his rapid disappearance triggered some kind of alarm.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their eyesight.
Some light was timid, but that it would react to waving hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter already goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten the potty.
All that remains is to attract another spider.
I'm already broadcasting my wish on the air, and I hope they didn't give up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the B-number.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein, which enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century may never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to immerse himself in everything so deep that the product was always a staggering discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He came into the consciousness of people primarily with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportion.
It can also not be neglected to explain the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of popular relativity theory are so complex for many that they prefer to choose easy proportions for a closer introduction.
But it is not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this, too: An hour near your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his entire pley of famous quotes these ten, which I was literally captivated by.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius tries not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one at any time can prove that I was wrong.
But it is a sad period when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, then what does it reflect an empty table?
I don't know what he's gonna fight with in World War III, but in the fourth, it's gonna be sticks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that my life depended on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
Finally, I can't forgive not putting Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are expecting changes for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four of them have been in black numbers all this year," said Captain Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the district facilities at the moment is about CZK 32 million.
This is mainly due to higher remuneration from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This fact also shows that, after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, the constructions, which together will cost nearly CZK 1.5 billion, are coming together.
The long period, when we were mainly shopping for machines, ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings because we can't do top health care without them, because the plans were justified by the Regional Deputy Minister for Health Lubomír Nečas.
He's looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospitals next year.
In Vsetín now select suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
In Kroměříž, they have an extension of dialysis planned.
Uherské Hradiště wants to build a new internment for about 200 million for this year's open central pavilion.
And the Baťa Hospital in Zlín awaits a long delayed construction of a new central income and internment, which will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said the director of Vsetín Hospital Věra Prousková, for example, on the construction of the Vsetín internal hospital.
The five-story building is to be completed there in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
More comfort for patients.
The changes that patients are particularly familiar with will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients are lying in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, beds are unmountable, windows are leaky and health professionals do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and is now at the limit of his lifetime," said Pavel Calábek, director of the Berlin Hospital.
It will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with urgent income within a few years.
Doctors and patients will have all acute wards in one place, plus in new spaces.
The same model is half finished in Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing, and in three years' time, it will be joined by an intern.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the county.
Profit is still the highest, and it didn't make it to the loss two years ago, when the Zlin Hospital, for example, faced nearly 200 million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase revenue and manage costs efficiently throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy, said.
Patients in Kroměříž hospital will also get better.
Within ten to fifteen years it will go into repairs, new equipment and reconstruction of up to half a billion crowns.
The repair of the interception station will be completed this year, then the extension of dialysis or construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after negotiations with his European colleagues that the other states of the Czech Republic are pushing for quotas to redistribute refugees, but they reject any discussion.
It also points out that no one has explained to him yet how he should maintain the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not get an answer, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the position you have come up with at the meeting of the Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with compulsory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They're living creatures who have visions, they're headed somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they redistribute.
We can't imagine.
We did not get an answer, and that is why we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, namely registration sites, border control, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas solve everything?
A while ago, we were dealing with $40,000, now it's $120,000.
When will it be $500,000?
And how do we keep these people in that area?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people crossing us want to go to Germany.
We don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their target country are supposed to come to us, gaining asylum in our country, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that the fugitives didn't really want to see us, but we've already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Would it not be possible to accept more of them in this way?
We've pledged to accept 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said, functional hotspots, border control, military operations.
Even with the 1500, the point is, there's 1100 people coming to take care of the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detection facility and we'll treat them the same way as the ones we picked up.
It is a big question, and we will debate that with Europe if we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece or Hungary.
Because Europe treats this in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
This means that they will come into our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet available, it may happen that we will not hold the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave again to Germany.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with the asylum procedure.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of European statistics show that they gain international protection.
They will then receive documents that will allow them to travel throughout Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are 400 people who will be relocated.
This is the second project that has been going on so far, and there we have only progressed in discussing with churches the possibility that they could help them get employment, housing and so on.
But that's running on a very long track.
You said the other states were unwilling to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not that the Czech Republic merely rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity move to unblock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can reach them, the report spreads within hours of all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migration wave that goes to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think that the road is to protect the external borders - simply to deter those migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Make sure they don't stand a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovans came to Germany last year alone.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturations of this state, including police, courts, prosecutor's office.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of economies, the 50 percent of what social systems are in vain for today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day that Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was 12.
How far is this going to go to make border controls even tighter?
We were afraid of capture in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we handle.
We still have a few hundred open seats in the stone detection facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We're doing it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, it's complicated with Hungary, and the Greeks - it's a completely useless story.
So where's the turning point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days will drain our capacity enough to make emergency plans.
Then I agree with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation were to arise, the government could sit down de facto immediately, and by one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police for the army, say customs administration, or prison service.
The extreme variant is a state of emergency, which has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can come to us this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to make this happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarms.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will attempt to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct journey to Austria.
This would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debt at the last minute.
They're trying to prevent a bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid her debts.
Footballers got their money.
Football Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after Online Services from Pacific Samoa submitted a proposal to her about 20 million crowns.
Attorney Slavia Zuzana Mládek tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzl within hours that she should not declare a decline over Slavia.
And it has to be said, from the arguments she had.
One of the main arguments was that the previous week a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also Czech billionaire Jiří Šimána became the new owner of Slavia.
Apparently, money arrived at the club from the new owners at the last minute.
This is also demonstrated by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's trial - the Vršovice club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent the owed tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," said attorney Slavie Mládek.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, to the Slovak representative Milan Ivan and Czech midfielder Mari Ličkov.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday the club paid the dues of Prague 10.
Thus, only the debts that are at odds with Slavia remain a de facto part of the insolvency dispute.
According to the club, the commitments were not made at all, or they were subject to litigation.
However, we are prepared to pay the sums in the event of these disputes being lost.
"We have the funds we need in the bank account, which we can document by extracting from the account," attorney Mládek told the judge.
"Everything that has been overdue is paid," Mládek said, adding that only unpaid or conflicted liabilities are outstanding.
It is also certain that in the next few days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid those debts.
Subsequently, all evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected at the earliest in November.
The judge ordered a continuation of the hearing on November 3.
However, the decision will not be made even at this meeting, but only in writing after it.
Medals for the Finns and Austrians.
FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of cutting-edge technologies, hardware and software integrated into modular construction brings benefits and a quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
From welding of structural steel to welding of special alloys, as well as welding of rough materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding of shipyards.
An incredible amount of welding curves, simple adjustment and expansion of the welding source allows you to respond quickly to the change in requirements, resulting in reduced downtimes, the need to reposition the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X allows welding by top welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of welding.
It stops wasting time and there is no waste of material or repairing faulty strife.
Flexibility is ensured, there are fewer downtimes, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's novelty, which premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these honors very much, because they confirm the exceptionalness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but due to their differences in software and parameter control, FastMig X is the world's top.
The delivery periods, which range around three weeks, are also pleasant for those interested.
In the Czech Republic we have already established the first contacts, which will definitely expand after the Brno fair.
We have been regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better after him than before, Miroslav Streichsbier, head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen, emphasizes for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka was built so she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says the expert at the firm that designed the tunnel.
Blanka was even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka Tunnel Complex could be built in such a way that there were no two sinks of soil in Stromovka in Prague, says the production director of Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said so on Wednesday evening during a journalistic tunnel tour.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It opens to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"Tunel was more secure, but costs grew exponentially," Butovich said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to run a safer and more careful method.
"If the measures were applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
The construction was intended to cost CZK 17 billion according to the original intent.
Adding to that the VAT that jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
When technology, land purchase and engineering, ad valoremization and similar items are added to this, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37, said Bělohlav
Someone ordered that and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, reduction of fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of year-round profits due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The shares of the company decreased by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trade 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx reports that it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes in spite of an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 percent, which will be reflected in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transport heavy or large packages that start in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher incomes and growth in online trading.
Chairman of the Board and CEO of Fred Smith said that the company "showed firm performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
The holiday recruitment plans were announced the day after the rival UPS company stated that it was planning to hire between 90,000 and 95,000 extra workers, which is about the same as they were hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx acquired $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, causing revenue to stagnate in its Express Unit.
But the boom in online shopping boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded a higher income due to higher base rates, while profit declined in freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before FedEx's shares opened, they fell by $3.85, or by 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At its most anticipated meeting over the years, federal reserve legislators will spend two days this week settled at the 27-foot Honduran Mahagon Table, deciding whether after nearly ten years the time has come to increase the key interest rate.
Standing over them at one end of the central bank ornament, a two-story meeting room will be a United States mural.
The map is a reminder that Chairman Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize American employment and keep local prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, about whether the US economy is ready to launch when we stop from unprecedented stimulus in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data show a solid economic growth, recent turbulence in the world's financial markets could already scare the Fed into adding volatility by increasing its federal fund reference rate - even by no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist of the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse to not increase the rate, increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg anticipated a rate increase this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with only a key indicator of about 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to the decline in the stock market if the Fed increased rates only if politicians soften the downturn by promising that the next increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the industrial average of Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, at 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by the expectation that Fed politicians would delay rates this week calmly, says John Lonski, chief economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed would now raise rates," he says.
If Fed politicians had done this, "they would have to go to the limit in their program statement and hold the financial markets by hand so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty from how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that through the spring and early summer she expected to raise rates this year despite complaints from the Liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level considered by the Fed to be full employment.
Wage profits showed signs of a raise.
And while inflation continues to be below the annual 2% target of the central bank, Fed politicians claim that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to crumble at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones's industrial average fell up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that a slowing Chinese economy would bring global growth down.
The market somewhat reflected this month and Dow is now losing only almost 10% of the May peak.
The Fed’s policy-makers’ restless market situation gives a comprehensive calculation of the start of an interest rate increase.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets, and reports of China's economic weakness in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
They now predict that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about China's latest developments," Oliner said.
The health situation of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint by then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "throw" their monetary expansion on the market, triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely linked, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for Envestnet Inc's wealth-management company.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of exaggerated movements in financial markets that seem inconsistent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting policy-making member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who pushed for tariff increases, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage point during three sessions "Despite limited identifiable impacts on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prefer concern for financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Committee setting rates at the Bank of England.
The latest turmoil is not even close to this level, he stated.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rate growth because markets got angry," said Posen, president of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's Chinatown, not Thaitown.
The market/storage is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
Even the car part is available if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive, and it'll take you over an hour to get through all the alleys.
If you're hungry about all this shopping, go get a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inside store stand (good, cheap) is close to registers and has various sampling points.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
The limits of fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is large, such as fish - employees behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezing section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, freely selling semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
The wide alleyways meet shopping carts and forklifts.
Found: Fresh monthong durian next to the box office stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounds the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Speed on the highways stays the same.
The House rejected the acceleration to 150 km/h.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the speed of the highest allowed speed to 150 km/h under favorable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to do so when it accepted the Senate amendment, which rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Road Communications Act will now head to the President.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that a law allowing a 200-mile-long speed would veto.
The increase was also opposed by Minister Dan Ťok (for YES), according to which the Czech highway network is not yet built for such speed.
On Tuesday, on Tuesday, the MPs supported the Senate version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow for an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane roads, in accordance with the original government proposal.
The House first extended this possibility to highways on which it could be driven in selected sections at a speed of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
Members have now accepted his proposal.
Senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport from the amendment, also removed the authorisation of the Transport Police to have the last word in modifying the local roads that are cared for by the municipalities.
The Senate version approved by the House also provides for the possibility for sewerage, water supply or public lighting cables to be stored longitudinally below the road surface.
The municipalities would save money to buy the land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local routes regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and facilitate the management of towed vehicles to which owners do not apply.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles that are not claimed by their owners within six months of notification of the tow.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of a fine even for shipping companies.
The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of existing paper, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The mouth expressor goes to trial.
He's facing 10 years for overpriced welcome to the citizens.
The case relates to the allegedly overpriced citizens' greeting project.
The police wanted to prosecute even the Member Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not publish it.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both of them face up to ten years in prison.
The main trial is scheduled for two October days.
According to the state's attorney, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns of damage, resulting from the indictment.
The applicant shall rely on an expert opinion.
According to the prosecutor, former members of the city's leadership have unlawfully allowed the acquisition of the property benefit of the company that organized the welcoming of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the municipal department of services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the selection procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, City Hall cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted by the city to the administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges led by the aim of ensuring for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organisation of the Citizens' Welcome event in Ústí nad Labem in the long term and coordinatedly acted at least contrary to the requirement to proceed with the care of a proper economic operator, writes the public prosecutor.
At the same time, he said they were aware that Darothore would then charge Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Citizens Welcome event, which would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the project file, the company raised more than CZK 5 million.
In the end, the city paid off only one part, approximately CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was overpriced by at least a million crowns.
Mandík had previously rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crimes, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this constructed case, the former mayor said earlier that the city under his leadership had only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Roxy II provided the event between 2008 and 2010.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," added Mandík.
The CSIs originally wanted to accuse MP Kailová, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it for prosecution.
The CSIs have therefore postponed the case in its case, but they are counting on charging Kailová after her parliamentary mandate has ended.
The welcoming of the citizens was a social event held several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for CZK 5,000 to buy children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police officials reportedly released a dog on a fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly intercepted the AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a record on which a police dog reportedly knocked a fugitive to the ground.
However, the Hungarian Government disputes this charge.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Police officers intervened against refugees, and one of them had a Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he laid down, says Muzi.
One of the police officers noticed that Muzi was filming everything and wouldn't let him leave.
The journalist was then not allowed to telephone his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Muzi's officers took him to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then he was ordered to delete the footage.
The men thus lost the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt like he was in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
The behaviour of police officers in it was unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not have to fear that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács appealed to the police report of Muzi's trial of events questioned.
He said that the police only wanted the journalist to show them if they were on some footage, which they said they had a right.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark - they are trained to deter and scare a little bit, but they did not attack with certainty," says Kovács.
Unpredictable Champions League.
The City win kicks us up, Juventus believes
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserve to lose," Manuel Pellegrini, a home city coach, turned his head.
We had more chances, and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team has created many opportunities, but the ball on the kicks was longer ours.
"The cause of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," he assessed the Pellegrini match, whose team won in the competition match after a long 636 minutes.
This finalist of the last season Juventus was on it exactly the opposite before a mutual encounter - after the first three rounds of the Italian League he has only a point as a defending title and with a score of 2:4 located in the 16th place of the table.
Therefore, the turn to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manchuchi and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to it we will find a victory wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best men in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the offensive phase.
That's what my players deserve.
"Before our balancing goal, we could, on the other hand, collect at 0:2, but Gianluigi held us back," praised Allegri goalkeeper Buffon's coach.
"We burned a few good chances," was the pity of Yayu Touré, City's midfielder.
We need to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Good-bye, Angela. Good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media craziness around here is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies carrying on their parents' hands after the dirt roads of the exodus.
And this automatically causes guilt and compassion in a person - that is, a European person.
Well, they don't just come here desperate kids, you see in the footage of boats landing to the Greek islands that babies don't show up so much!
Well, we've had pictures of ships heading for Lampedusa, fugitives from the French border near Menton whose beautiful promenade thousands of young men are lying down.
For the most part, young blacks.
And the pictures from Callais have disappeared, where these black men are waiting to see if they can get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's touching it anymore.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian Church of Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There was too much falseness.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it is somehow concealed that it is not just unfortunate children from Syria, but also secreted - for elders: fashionably dressed - young men.
Whose musculatures look like they just came out of some kind of fit center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus we lay on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no ham.
And young blacks came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Ages between 15 and 30.
They entered the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In hands, of course, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they weren't interested, and the workers - Turks, Muslims! - apparently, they were afraid of them.
They've taken all the chairs.
Who wasn't lying on it and was in the sea, was unlucky.
They were dressed like American rapper movies.
On the heads of a hat with a nail, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started feasting.
They took tables around, stuffed themselves next to the sitting brown and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled the dining terrace to a quiet place.
The incoming blacks drank beer straight out of thirds - like in the shows from USA?! - on the beach threw empty bottles around.
They kept yelling loudly at each other.
But it wasn't English.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight out of bottles.
They jumped into the hotel swimming pool - in designer swimsuits, especially those young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, mothers with children and pensioners panickedly escaped, and in half an hour there was no one black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't get it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had about a 20-centimeter massive cross made of gold on his neck.
And women were like jewelry stores.
"Are these drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them drinking," said the waiter.
They don't smuggle or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I figured out what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what would happen next.
But the Secret Service and top politicians should have known first.
They don't seem to know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and linked to them by lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now a publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie, lie, and lie - but not only they, but also the leaders of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on the level of images of Moscow television from August 1968.
Of course, there were some sun rowers at the station, but mainly - ancient German - Muslims welcomed their tribemen.
They have been babbling on the news on Czech TV for weeks, as according to some research the Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
Of course, who's only been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by other information.
For example famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Society of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
That's what our televisions did.
However, they withheld what burst in Germany the next day: that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, i.e. five years ago, "Our efforts at a 'multi-culti' company have completely failed."
She then said, "Germany gives up fighting for a multicultural society."
"All efforts for such coexistence have completely failed".
In a country where four million Muslims live, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live alongside each other without being integrated has failed, and today they live with us, and we have been lying for a while that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
That's not reality.
A multicultural approach where we say that we just live happily together, so this approach failed.
He's completely failed.
But I don't think Merkel has the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
Conflict is rapidly increasing.
EuroGerman Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who is said to have no graduation in the Europarliament - yes, that is the one that Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play an overseer in a concentration camp - as he has done before.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubikon.
Let us note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of countries that have been victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who for years, at least outwardly, have tried to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and a murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil is sown in the soul of Germany by aggression, superiority, and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his strength the Grand Germans' attempts to control the whole centre of Europe?
When did he say the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When he was shut down, preparation for World War I began.
The idea of Great Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars costing millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After the Marxists' attempt to dominate the state, for example with Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, for example, on the basis of ecology, which was by the way one of the main ideas of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving all those fighters against the atom, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people who everywhere want to do something differently and better, they have taken a full turn to the side of the fighters against heating the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slovak current treating all Slavs as a difficult vermin - since Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And, as the last statements of Schulz and the German minsters openly threaten the disobedient eastern states, the idea of a leader in Germany show.
Which must be obeyed without reproof.
Otherwise, woe be unto you!
And if we add the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is behind this, as always, capital, especially German, which is good for it and which derives from the fact that Germany actually controls most of Europe's states through banks and the Union.
The sander's pseudomism first led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multi-clturnalism, bringing them home today and possibly bringing millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by siren voices, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and begin to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force again, a part of its inhabitants - but it seems to be getting a little bit more and more ideologically mad, but eventually reality will catch up with him as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim dorms are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
Whom will be helped by Muslims who have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans embark on themselves, following the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and even to Germany, when people rise up who will protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superhuman Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict, which in Europe sparked the support of the sunbathing ideology, e.g. the ideology of elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt act against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, it cannot turn out well.
Finishing tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy sellers: scare them to death.
Just knock and a robust knock will break on you in a way that the weaker nature may not stand.
The revived head wipes you off nicely and drives you away hard, escorts you (or rather drives you away) of the persistent seller and the revived statue.
Maybe it's too bad you can't get a talking doorknob in reality.
We could use a lot of squints and scumbags to drive away.
Red oxalis (Oxalis corniculata).
A tiny weed that tolerates dry environment.
And so it is found among the outdoor tiles near my home.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expansive weeds, but looks like it creates a nice impression of flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's erratic, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, she's easy to adapt, modest and undemanding.
He creates leaves with chaotic composition, but it is worth watching and taking pictures.
The beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple accompaniment is still under consideration.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast-feeding diet
The Brazilian Pediatric Society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey knowledge to women of the importance of a good diet in breastfeeding using images of children sucking from their breasts painted with the display of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to the excess of energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic production of their children and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, though Nine's is trying to take the lead on Today Show
The escape of Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry due to the cost of the consequences of the Liberal leadership leak failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
The Morning Show Nine projected from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Army is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny did not seem to matter so much to audiences of Aussie TV, as it recorded 397 000 viewers in averages in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers broadcasting Today.
Today recorded a minor increase in its rating compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was only after last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been filling the Sunrise gap in recent months.
In August, there was an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more than parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!

The great news for Seven was a stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters by Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand, has on average very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night gives a clear "yes".
The X Factor by Seven retained strong 1,136 million viewers, thus smoothly defeating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings of the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30) featured by Andrew O'Keefe' had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
Monday night, The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the second half of the incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Due to the fall in the ratings of The Chase Australia from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a Million Dollar Minute show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secrets revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who would win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to Bachelor with is wrapped up in an unbeatable secret.
And the three girls who stay standing will certainly not reveal who is the one who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before only two left, they unwittingly told us who was going to win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's finale
All three women lyricically chanted why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, which one gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could have functioned as a splicer about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one best suited to Wood in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched Sara and Sam's energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, it's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're well and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For her herself, she claims that during his last home visits, she realized that Wood might be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls just as much - it's between Snezena and Lana indecisive.
The Bachalor airs on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams were asking after his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which he did convert the Australian rugbium league in the first pitch kickoff in Tuesday's 20:3 win to Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, stated that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and care only for another game.
As early as the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne fixed his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured swearing when he left the field after the error and later said to the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start of a NFL career he could not even imagine.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when recording in his own wicket territory led to a threesome of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for 27-year-old players.
Hayne posted a photo with fans, on which he holds the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russia Vladimir Putin will meet in a discussion on gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested at gunpoint on the Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts limited.
The ÚS advocated emigrants seeking compensation for property.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989 it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the amount requested, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by giving them only less than 90 thousand crowns, referring to the amount of compensation being determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The Emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and were initially sued.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to a complaint against the ÚS.
In the meantime, there was such a change in social and economic circumstances that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although it represented compensation adequate in relation to the property being removed - is now only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the expense of the interveners as a restitution of authorized persons who have been seeking their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation before," explained Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, who explained why the ÚS stood on the side of the emigrants.
"The ÚS has repeatedly stated that the general courts should proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistency should not be interpreted against the beneficiaries and that the purpose of restitution legislation, namely the atonement of property injustices caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, should always be achieved," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA is now performed by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, by the way, became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998 she portrayed the role of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, he says, "Today the intensity of Evita did not match the performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monika Absolon for the role of first lady of Argentina.
I saw the moon three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspirational for me.
This is where I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I'm quite a supporter of more modern modifications, but this is simply a particularly good one.
"The director of Ondřej Sokol is original, lightweight and contemporary," Fišarová notes.
The imaginary handover of musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monica Absolonová's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7pm at Studio DVA.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
Experience will surely include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Silent Your Cry, Argentina!).
In the limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also take off from the director's desk when he will act as President Perón during the filming of the film Karl Roden.
Due to public interest, additional dates were then added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita presents the Studio DVA Theatre in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolonová.
At her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of He Peter Strenáčik.
The legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with the Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovsky are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Mark, who was already involved in the first performance at the Spirál Theatre.
4 people killed after policemen fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber projectiles into a crowd of protesters against the design of a new state constitution, said a clerk on Wednesday.
Violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, reports that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, stating.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This clash was the last in a week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and alleviated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in West Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the emergence of its own state.
As of 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed a country-sharing agreement into provinces — a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials state that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We can't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of master Litvínov, you couldn't even handle a home duel with Sparta hockey players (3:5).
Aren't you worried about the same disastrous entry into the extraliga as you were a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.
Honorer Folk.
NHC predicts a 60 percent probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde Islands is likely to be 60 percent in the emergence of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, reported the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent probability of developing a tropical cyclone formation over the next two days, adding a weather forecast based in Miami.
Google launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said that it launches a campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states in escaping war-torn and poor countries. Google doubles every amount collected.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoudová published the report on her blog based on personal experience as a seven-year-old fled with her family from Kabul.
"We travelled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families, like mine, are willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all posts made via google.com/refugeerelief will double up to $5.5 million.
Europe faces the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of which come from Syria swept away by a four-year war, which has driven to 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether moderately obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data take a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on a new study of JAMA surgery.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the survey has been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the height-related weight relationship, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indicate overweight of a person and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastric gastricectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were moderately obese.
Average BMI among those undergoing surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 to the end of their fifth year, according to a study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical diabetes treatment remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 percent and in part only about 2 percent of patients were resolved completely for comparison of diabetes.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol has also been demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," found by authors.
Researchers also monitored the patient’s levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, reflecting the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, reported by researchers.
After surgery, the mean A1c haemoglobin dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group lost more weight than the gastricectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reached greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent against 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to an extension of life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone it is a soothing result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Here this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," it states.
Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously after the decline of the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to show people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once they accumulate these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" — Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the near east.
The Tibetan leader of Buddhists called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama dealt with the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on a study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that, under current circumstances, mankind’s interest should be put ahead of the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable it was, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dlai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in resolving the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to how to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the US' violent response triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children ingesting the sanitizer over the last 4 years
Toxicology centres around the United States reported an almost 400-percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who smoldered a highly alcoholic sanitizer, according to the toxicological center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Centre, the number of ingestions in children under the age of 12 reported at poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink an ambulance device deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking an ambulance for cheap fuss.
The teens reportedly mixed a sanitizer with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to an attractive fragrance.
"Children don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot more attractive (sanitative) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitation products with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges are available, which are very appealing to children.
The ambulance contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in young children, several locus may mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 Station in Kansas City's medical director of the Toxicology Control Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey just lie around, either, but people leave these ambulances outside, and when the kids get to them, it's a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four locus of the sanitizer with the scent of strawberries and was taken for treatment to the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered adult drunkenness, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any sign of brain trauma, as the girl fell over alcohol and punched herself in the head, stating Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers the use of non-alcoholic products or to arrange for sanitary devices to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some ambulances were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing an ambulance device that contained toxic, undeclared ingredients.
The paramedics believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in North New York planned to poison their "evil" teachers by deploying antibacterial products across the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary devices and forbids their presence in the room.
Police assessed the foiled plan as "innocent chatter," referring to the discipline of the school district,
Rumour: No disharmony in the Celtic team
Griffiths bagates talk of inconsistency in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is concerned that new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons raise their lead over Celtice by 5 points
The first half penalty in ADAMA Rooney's submission secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, making Dons a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of inconsistency
This situation has sparked rumors of inconsistency in Celtic, which were denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates do not work under any pressure from increased surveillance in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former reserve Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them due to the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador to Ajax, states, "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the Old Company matches, and not just the people of Scotland are watching these games.
I turn things back to good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted Celtic was stumbling a little bit, but the Norwegian boss undertook to turn things back to good.
The defeat by Malm and the subsequent fall out of the Champions League was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now rises to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has been through bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about current events.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, Ranger Chief Mark Warburton is concerned about large-scale buying reinforcements and insists that he does not want to disrupt the team's unity from Ibrox.
Former head of Brentford states, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer."
Players who come in the summer have an entire preseason period to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer destination suggests retirement
Swansea Michu's attacker, who was associated with Celtic in the transfer window, suggested that he might retire after the expiration of his contract with Swansea.
A 20-year-old gunman has had problems with a susceptible ankle for two years and has failed to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum, which was recalled.
Neilson stands by his claim and states, "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastleu
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics directed for former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was an evasive moment," the attacker stated and continues, "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in Celtic's jersey."
The Council of Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in remedying the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCINnes is happy for "ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately stick against Hamilton Accies to manage to win the seventh league win in a row and a five-point lead over Celtice at the top of the table due to the penalty of the first half in the submission of Adam Rooney.
McInnes states, "There is no team that has won anything, either Cups or Leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scotland’s unemployment remains unchanged, while the UK’s overall unemployment rises
EMPLOYMENT in Scotland remains unchanged to 164,000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the UK rate (5.5%), as data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a period of three months, with the number of workers now halting to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland has fallen to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Secretary of State of Scotland David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market, and Scottish employment has increased while unemployment has declined.
Why I Witnessed the Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will be watching a man be killed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison's death chamber and seeing Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to worry.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because there are often more requests than vacancies, morbid lottery is being carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will be watching the entire execution unbiasedly.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one and a half hours of visitation.
I like this kid.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help with procedures against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'm gonna be really objective.
To this end, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die an unnecessary death.
A man escaped Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after extricating the man from the Canning River.
A bet by a man from Petrh that he would escape the police did not come out after getting into shallow mudwater just metres from a police officer who tried to persuade him to return to shore in a nonviolent way.
Canning Vale police were summoned in an incident crossing Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come and get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't exactly want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and that police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things while escaping," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning the biathlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the races
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria's organizers of trying to get a spy in his stable last year and threatened to immediately end the racing.
He focused on organizers and the Department of Integrity Racing Victoria and based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation with regard to Lidarin's positive swab for cobalt that he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Previously Moody released a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the department's integrity tried to spy on him.
"18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him employment in my stables for finding out information about the things being done in my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information, because in trying to catch me, they totally burned.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Does the RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside coaching positions to take responsibility for what happens in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people around here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm saying will provide them with material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really made me sad.
I'll push them and put a burden on them to make a decision.
I have my family's support, and I can leave.
The frustration levels of the coach increased with a long-term investigation over the cobalt including Lidari and the recent scratching made him feel that "he could have had his license on the table for hours."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on the day of the race "ridiculous" after the horse's feet were applied clay poultice or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his foot.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for tiling treatment on the day of the race, for which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The Cobram driver who ran away was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram this weekend and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by the car on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with non-stop accidents, non-assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, head coach of Melbourne Storm, criticized the actions of his players as "setting the plan" by two NRL favorites of the premiership.
Trent Robinson, head coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the controversial Storm team victory in the Sydney final qualification on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark on Strorm after his team won the final qualification over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "show" rugby league and according to him two of Queensland's were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the interventions of his players and said they focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation increased his confidence as his team is criticized by two head coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeat from Team Storm.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24–2," he said on Wednesday Bellamy.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defensive system and techniques in the last year, and we've just been putting emphasis on contact during the procedures for the past few weeks, and that's been a turnaround for us.
Trent's been here for three years, and apparently he's coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right in that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that seems to him to be abolishing, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
Such football you would like to play if you had this type of players at your disposal.
He said this opinion in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they're worried about a fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they got to the big fights.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that more goals fell in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos team's game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are intermissions and failures interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they're mentioning us, it means we'll definitely meet again at the stage.
Storm are on break this weekend and won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
A Serbian man got a $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland was bailed out of USD 200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drug from the Solay yacht that arrived from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted in a meeting with the co-convicted at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential sentence of life for owning commercial quality cocaine, lawyer Maksimovice argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafe by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would escape.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the trial.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and stepfather Maksimovice jointly offered bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that the USD 200,000 deposit is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Apparently, their efforts themselves were insufficient, as the accused did not appear further in court, warning.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both the Australian and Serbian passport, will report to the police daily and will observe curfews from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used a cell phone of an 11-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while sleeping, then applied to her online chat, where he had a lot of naughty photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found out that she was missing her phone and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police became involved and saw five photographs, then analytical computers found the address and discovered "disturbing" searches on the web using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was to "introduce paedophiles" on the Internet before he would "pretend to be a police officer and scare them."
Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson stated for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's an addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer search, but he claims he was just trying to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them.
He claims to have lost his mind drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on her phone, he called his mother, shaking and crying.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to bringing an action regarding the admission or provision of inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, violated bail conditions on January 25 and failed to appear in court on March 24 of that year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sex offenders because he may argue that there was no "essential sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence to October to file a social worker report.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sex offenders before the date of his sentence.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the African oldest leader, fell earlier that year on the stairs leading to the stage.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they received anonymous threats of killing, which warned them of booing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the MP's Democratic Change Movement (MDC), Innocent Gones, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to obstruct Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is named 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and that once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief stated that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "behaviors" regarding threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolishing 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the company's business services costs.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the business of computers and printers from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected job cuts will result in a change in the range of about $2.7 billion and the start will take place in the fourth quarter, states HP in the statement.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will be in charge of the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of shops to help businesses switch to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers worldwide.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have a company's annual income of over $50 billion and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will be the distribution of the company, founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP went through a massive reorganization to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical firms in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Captain of Arsenal Mikel Artet says that teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilsher before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilsher that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason for him not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere finished strong last season after an ankle injury and then got back into the former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger claims.
It's a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It didn't concern his ankles or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be purely medically true, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different Wilsher injuries since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has only played in 65 league matches of Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you return after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition", says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he does, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Artet are likely to start.
Wenger could also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and let players who need it breathe," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after they maintained the campaign "undefeated" last season.
On Wednesday night, the stadium shook with a 3.2-degree Richter earthquake.
That was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal learned from last season's Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco and remains far from hoping to lead the club to its first European Cup victory.
"This deployment is tremendous," Wenger says.
It never happened to the Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar images on various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever in terms of suicide among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the only biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Man, whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
At the heart of this struggle lies a friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of over 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally sound friends represents half the chance for mental problems to occur.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it must be achievable first.
In this social media communication with emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and successful has doubled, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial achievement is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as a billionaire and game creator recently explained, money really doesn't buy any better luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this thought for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities who glowed through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent sacrifice, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can also relate to it, although they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."My role as a listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be seen as weak to open up to problems.
Friends are one of the shows that comes up in my memory when I try to offer a more long-term settlement mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As for my assignment, the condition of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer distance, from a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to FrendsFest this weekend organized by Comedy Central Station, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone at Starbucks alone, smile at him and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends series will be broadcast at Comedy Central Station from start to finish - full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a wicket against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut at the Champions League and helped the PSG defeat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the report of the game and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey at the Champions League with a final comfortable win of 2–0 against Malma at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and this PSG player sent French champions after the win, then threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for elimination rounds, but on improving their trip to the quarterfinals they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not a classic performance of the Laurent Blanca team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal before the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In the Champions League it is not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2–0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve with the course of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, who suffered a 2–2 draw at home this weekend with Bordeaux at League 1, but was overshadowed by Di Mario in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who would shift the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transition from Manchester United last month, and showed why, when he ran on Marco Verratti's passport to defend Malma and with a beautiful finish he sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back to the remote corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to start a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and got to this stage, joined with 9 internationals in the basic line-up and five defenders and two retracted midfielders were a heavy opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjic's shot, which just narrowly missed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, he was not offered much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with bad passes and lousy endings, which was not good even from Ibrahimovice, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was just from his pass when Di Maria sent a rotating missile that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan header sent past the line already the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic passed him after a pass from the left wing by Maxwell.
This ended all of Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could make a profit from the match, and only the excellent Wilanda procedure from a large distance thwarted David Luiz's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of alternate Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide admitted more closely that the PSGs were a class higher than his team, Nor stated, "Our last game in the Champions League took place last December."
Since then, we've only played the Swedish League that's not on the same level.
Qualification matches aren't enough.
Hats off for Paris.
It was a wonderful match for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion selling shares
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, who was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, made $2.5 billion of stock sales on Wednesday as part of his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in its statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with the price-reducing of commodities, as China’s slowdown in the economy reduces demand and ignites sparks of destruction across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore stock prices to the top in London's stock market in early morning stores on Wednesday.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69% above.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares is part of wider plans to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, which marked 2.4 percent discount on closing price on Tuesday.
So they got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about the extension of Chinese growth's braking have reduced the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the US at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his Tuesday report.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the President visited in November, said the report.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks are over.
"President Xi's visit represents an opportunity to consolidate relations between the US and China and urges cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the disagreements of both states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several technical leaders of the U.S. on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for the UN September meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address disputed problems, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber-spy and its increasing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis swept the Schengen area.
The emergency flare launched by Germany did not stint the European crew, but already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: it will rather systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they step on the old continent - particularly in Greece, rather than argue over the future allocation of refugees by quota on the basis of the quantities that are increasingly distant from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed priority.
Before caring for the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are arriving today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for migration management," emphasises the text discussed by ministers on Monday in Brussels.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its determination and increasing pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the tide of those seeking asylum in this country.
This makes it clear to the Central Power that no free movement in Europe is possible without it.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but he sees blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is realized by rigor.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two thirds of the newcomers were already registered and identified with fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that there will be camps left on its shoulders in which refugees would accumulate at its expense.
Greece remains the real black hole.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as much as it has recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, has put their hands in its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of common concerns now for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises that the introduction of checkpoints will take place as soon as possible, but it did not state any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," the EU Interior Ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the European Border Control Agency's intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen island surveillance.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the emergence of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is nearing it.
The new emergency situation of the .38 has, anyway, pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was already established by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year, and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the duty, was retained on Monday in a text approved mostly by the .38.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the trial is suspended.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been reached by agreement in June during the hectic EU summit, is concluded by Le Figaro.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also a woman who survived as the only one of the affected eight-member group.
Previous media reports said it was about Polka.
About a 30 - year - old woman was hospitalized in Briancon, with severe leg injuries in the femur area.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly made up of 40s.
"The rescue action ended, also the victims' bodies were transported to Briancon for identification," Pierre Besnard specified the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
Unfortunately, it happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the peak of Mount Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 metres.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 metres wide and about a meter high," noted the head of rescuers Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, the eight - man group was about 3,900 metres [3,900 m] tall of snow.
Meteorological services today did not warn the area of weather.
Trpišovský before the match with Braga: Finally, a true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský managed to pass the European League footballers through the front of the European League to the basic group during his opening night in the Cups and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
Slovan at the opening of the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist of 2011 Bragu and according to the coach she wants to impose her game style.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, when each goal and each situation could knock you out on your way to the dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every wicket we've earned, we can play our tactics and we're not tied up with just a double match.
"I look forward to it very much and it is a true Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
He considers Bragu a top team.
It will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may also be harder to say that he has no such name, but he has a player in his cadre who, I suspect, gave Manchester three goals.
"It is an excellent group at the level of top teams," Trpišovský said.
But he doesn't consider Braga a clear favourite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost from eleven duels of this season only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that Liberec can force Braze's style.
We have a team waiting to be strong on the ball, at the same time it is unusual for them to be disciplined.
They play from a 4-4-2 deployment with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the field," said Trpišovský.
In the pre-schools we studied the opponent a lot, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have adapted to training.
"And we certainly want it to be very difficult to play according to our notes," said the coach.
Student films take over Sand, starting an international festival.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have entered their works in the competition of the 15th International Festival of Student Films in Písek this year.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the final by a commission consisting of students and educators, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Portych cinema.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, said the festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Every year, the festival has its special theme that depends on the festival theme.
It's a mystery this year.
The director of this year's gala evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we must also solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student creations - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, in which, for example, the winner of last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda, will sit.
Festival organizers like every year prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turboshanson band Will we fly?, play band Zrní or for example Petra Hapková with recital Life at the bar.
The festival will host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will be brought by a graduate of the Song Film School and a prestigious award winner, among whom is not missing even from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition will zoom in on the atmosphere that existed in Nepal after a tragic earthquake.
The film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and sand natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotný will christen his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondrík, patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film crafts," said a spokesperson.
Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, will certainly help to perform several job auditions at the same time and gain a job position.
The festival is connected with the formation of the Private Higher Professional School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, married Vladana and Miloň Terč, organized its first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth grade.
In the event of the bankruptcy of CK, insurance undertakings are to pay the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of clients in full in the event of a travel agency’s bankruptcy.
It was decided on Wednesday by the House when it approved a revised amendment to the Act on the Conditions of Tourism Business.
Travel agents will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee, according to a draft heading to the Senate.
Insurance companies with the obligation to pay client claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against bankruptcy when the amendment applies.
The proposal is also criticised by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they'll either have to quit or go abroad.
Local Development Minister Karla Šlechtová (for YES) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocomform.
She pointed out this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to full refund regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance companies will receive enough information on the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, stressed by Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-president of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work because no one gives it unlimited.
"Travel offices will have to shut down or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousko's concerns on the basis of a survey between member CKs.
"Stop showing us the lobbying of insurance companies," he said.
The comments made by the insurance companies do not consider Okamura relevant, there is no official written comments to this effect.
They are said to find out whether travel agencies will be complicit, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS) also warned about the provision, which referred to the position of the rival Association of Travel Agents of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of stairs to Czech travel agencies.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to arrange insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.
Her proposal to delete the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Nor did Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) follow the proposal to return the draft to the committee due to an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Philip pointed out travel agencies that he believes may be threatening consumers.
In view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, the draft rapporteur Martina Berdychová (ANO) withdrew her proposal to limit the liability of insurance undertakings in cases where they could not know that insurance transactions would not cover the whole risk.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum four-million-dollar insurance limit for travel agents offering air travel tours, and a million-dollar limit for offices selling bus tours, for example.
The border will remain on 30 percent of the planned revenues from the sale of tours.
However, the insurance performance limit will have to be such as to cover all customer claims in the event of a travel agent’s bankruptcy.
Even after the modifications, the standard provides that travel agencies will have to newly indicate which travel agency organises the trip for the tours sold.
Travel agents will have to submit to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, inter alia, information on the management and number of tours.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information of insurance companies.
Travel agents will have to deliver to them monthly information on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of tours sold and the amount of advance payments and sales for tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations towards the insurance undertaking, it shall invite it, according to the draft, to remedy or prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The amendment also has to newly modify the financing of mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the mountain service subsidy on the basis of its request, which it will submit by the end of April for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money in the previous year, a financial plan for expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the Association of Lawmakers, however, he did not figure out the situation of what would happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
She won't be allowed to organize tours and the clients who bought the trip before the insurance was cancelled will lose it, according to the Association.
In this case, CK will suffer a significant loss and may fail even though its management was in good condition.
One way that travel agents can cope with such a situation will be to sue the State for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then we will act only as agencies on our market, said Vice-President of the Association Jan Popež.
Although the draft amendment also includes a bank guarantee institution, it cannot be implemented at all in practice, as the bank guarantee cannot sound to an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the Association, the change in the practice so far is de facto unnecessary.
In the two-year period, the whole law will have to be re-worked in view of the new EU directive.
The Czech market is now operated by a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
This year, only three CKs ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell annual tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after negotiations with German country premieres.
At the same time, it again appealed to the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU among the Member States of the 28th.
We need to help more countries where refugees are leaving or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will stand for decent conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, that this signal could also be a sign of greater financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"College countries also support the German government in promoting fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
Earth Prime Minister of Brandenburg Dietmar Woidke said in this context at a press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU states.
The allocation of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out to speed up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start faster with the integration of foreigners, said the Brandenburg Prime Minister.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees also needs to be used to integrate those who have a chance of gaining asylum.
It will take more teachers to handle German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners are able to integrate, they can become a benefit to us, he said.
Matt Damon Bagates Diversity in the Movie
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the HBO project, Greenlight interrupted the actor cast in the Brown series, emphasizing the need for alternative views on black protagonists in the script.
"Speaking of diversity, you do it by casting the film and not by casting the show", Damon argues.
Shocked, she reacted indiscriminately to Brown with distrust and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up by common known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they will treat Harmony's character," Brown said in the beginning.
The only black character who's a hooker who's picked up by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon cut off that their director "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disarray with Damon's commentary.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at writing a clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the talk of a single black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
Tweet has won over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After being killed by a teenage Michael Brown white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national action and pushed the creators of laws and authority to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made allusions to the movement while stating nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Award ceremony.
"Alba are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the question of personality Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported on a list of entertainers, producers, and mogul media invited to visit the Pope to discuss depicting the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior Has First Winner"
Professional climber and piccolo Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and took home one million dollars.
In the competition, which had just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all obstacles on the track.
During the finals of this season, two men fought their way through to the final round, Caldero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on more than 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated first in the set limit and thus became the first contestant to overcome the debilitating 4 section in American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero surpassed it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for newsE! News right after its hard-earned victory and it was recognized that he was still in shock from winning a $1 million major prize.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," said Isaac E! in response to my winnings.
"So suddenly... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed has given an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finals and why Britten won no reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, money belongs to whoever finishes the track the fastest.
"If more contestants participate in the track, the prize will be won by the one with the best time," Weed said.
Although winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don’t think he has a grudge.
He's glad he managed to achieve what he did.
He got a warm reception from fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me: “If there was to be someone who could defeat me, I’m glad it was Isaac. ”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just walked right past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the pink garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams in the U.S. League Central Division right now.
Just narrowly averted their defeat, the Tigers defeated Minnessota with a tight result of 5–4 at Target Field Stadium in Tuesday's match.
The twins missed a chance to approach the Houston Astros team and captivate the second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which for them during the second half of the season was so elusive.
"Wining is always fun and it doesn't matter how," said Tiger manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive entrance and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took the next in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 hits and 3 runs.
It was his only third great game from the last nine games.
"This year I want to finish with convincing results," Simon said.
"It's hard to get into a game when you sit on a bench often and that's why I want to get in the game."
Tiger batsman Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 rounds and his first withdrawn point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last June game in which he hit four times in a match against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned pretty hard on it," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at training, batted noticeably better and managed to transfer it to the match."
Thanks to three circulations at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins got the best chance of getting back in the game.
Central Pole Byron Buxton earned a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the pitch.
Right Pole Aaron Hicks scored a point thanks to a set bat and Simon strategized Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy eliminated his only rival Mauer, and he had Miguel San's batsman in front of him, who batted the ball and ran two bases and left Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the bases and a chance to draw in the second innings, VerHagen managed to send a third metacrat over two bases.
Plouffe has already won 27 circulation over two bases this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit retained the ninth innings, Mauer earned two withdrawn points and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5–4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-handed guy knocked San out on three pitches.
Detroit took advantage and gained points in Phil Hughes' game.
Tigers gained three rounds in the first two innings against a retired right-handed man who joined the game after more than a month's hiatus due to back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," said Hughes, "but during my third shift I felt that I was doing better."
After resisting the onslaught in the first innings, Hughes let one point out to the other metaman Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the real fielder J.D. Martinez took out Victor Martinez, who first ran all the bases.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 series.
Third metr Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored another circulation, but Victor Martinez was switched when he tried to run to third base.
The Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and Pole Anthony Gose got them two and then one point and the score was 3–0 on the resulting board.
"This has put us at our knees," said Twin Manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but got him in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, finished in the third inning with no points and replaced him right-handed A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, took six hits and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, a true Tiger pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez' shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should start in Wednesday's match.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and take over against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded for left pitcher David Price, he has scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
Since August 20, however, he has not yet played because of the pulled muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play the third mutual game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota's left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will stand.
Xi calls for the opening up of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to a wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping to a group whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in enticing foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said on the 16th session of the Central Leader Group to deepen overall reform.
Promotion of opening in emerging reforms will give new impetus and vitality, also providing new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The Head Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policy, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, stating the statement.
The government will also release controls on the powers delegated to firms and make sure that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are funded from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement states.
Moreover, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
A new bed section may be established in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Důmek (ČSSD), the current capacity of bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the county is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between departments of individual hospitals.
But there are also opportunities to extend care in the county.
For example, surgical departments could develop centers of one-day surgery, where surgical fields that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed according to the set concept.
It is not yet clear at which specific hospitals the one-day surgery department should be in.
At the skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital, a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases could be created.
The concept also recommended the formation of an apalic center that would take care of patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentration of such facilities to the island hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, is after-care beds, especially those of Léčeben long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely linked to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, recommends concepts.
As he points out, after-care beds are mainly missing at Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There you could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least in the Karlovy Vary Region, social health beds are absent with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are scarce throughout the country, so it could also serve for other regions as a so-called Alzheimer’s centre.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, to which European funding will be released.
"It is a bed that will be linked to the fields of supe specialized care and will create room for translation of patients after surgery, for example, after cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," the regional concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
