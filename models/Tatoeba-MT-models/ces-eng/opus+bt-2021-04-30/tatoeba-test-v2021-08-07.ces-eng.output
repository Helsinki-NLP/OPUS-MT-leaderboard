According to the Tatoeby guidelines, members are recommended to either add sentences in their native language or translate from language they understand to their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose naturally sounding sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. We ask you to translate the sentence only if you know with certainty what it means.
