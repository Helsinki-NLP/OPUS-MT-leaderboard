Inflation in Europe jumped due to food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to constant growth in food prices.
The November price increase in 13 euro area countries was above expectations, with annual inflation registered 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, reporting to the Luxembourg Union Statistical Office.
The official forecast only predicted 3 percent, reported by Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian Emissions Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the basic interest rate, with a reduction in prices of raw materials rising and falling unemployment leading to an inflation spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below 2%, but close to it.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a preposterous situation: it must "predate" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about this later.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 percent of the 15-year record; in Spain it then rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has skyrocketed due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
The term wheat prices rose by 88 percent, also the soy exchange rate reached the highest value since 1973.
Likewise, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The world’s oil price has risen by 52 percent this year, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will shift from 2.1 percent to 2.5 in 2008 this year, but will drop to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain at around 3 % over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The Fidesz supporters' circle increased significantly as of early December, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while the Gallop Institute has never measured such low - 13 percent support in the case of socialists.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support compared to the fifth-year support of the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for accession to parliament: their support within the population is 2%.
There is one percent more among certain party voters of both camps.
The public's view of the economy has worsened, even in view of the previous minimum - the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be strictly very bad, so high - 41 percent, while, according to the other 46 percent, the situation is rather bad.
Families evaluate the change in their material situation after spring and summer more promising prospects now again more pessimistic.
As far as next year is concerned, the larger part of the population is counting on further deterioration and only a tenth of the improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled were judged by the Gallup Institute's most recent polls that the Prime Minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsány believes or highly believes 13 percent of the polled, while Viktor Orbán holds 38 percent of the supporters.
The Prime Minister has no confidence in 54 percent, the chairman of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While, after last October’s riots, the government and the Prime Minister considered it desirable to remain 35 percent, this share is now only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the launch of new elections.
It is characteristic of the interest in the referendum that 60 percent of the polls answered a question regarding their possible participation that it would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
To compare, "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly only take part in 55 percent and another 15 percent would consider their participation likely.
The schooler would be told no 74, medical fees 79, and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only within the circle of people certainly promising their participation, then introducing tuition fees, medical fees, and hospital fees would reject 81, 84, and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth of which was betrayed by Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangle maintained last year's, on average 16 percent price level growth, with the difference that VAT did not increase this year.
Article of the journal Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs business triangle increased by 16 percent on average this year, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase of not more than a thousand forints.
Since prices in supermarkets of food have already "aired" in December last year, a percentage of the price has not been so drastically expensive given the earlier high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that they will not be able to purchase what they could buy at a price of under 9,000 forints last year for less than ten thousand.
The daily farm's consumption basket in the examined hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
Unica and live fish have remained almost at last year's level, but they have very much undermined the cruel breasts, nuts and also poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in Auchan we found kilogram bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go below 200 forints with the price of the product.
Likewise, it was surprising in this store that the price of the two-litre Coca Cola in the refundable bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the backup only 257 forints stood.
However, this year, according to the consumer basket, Napi Gazdaság Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket raised by 15, compared to last year's Cora prices, while Tesco and Auchan increased by approximately 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and this year's lowest value of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the addition was an average of 1,480.
The average price increase last year was 1,006 forints, with prices being affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that the trade disrupted, and the trading houses obviously failed to decide how large the price ranges for individual products should be determined, as they could not predict the effect the price change would have on consumption.
(If the trader plans the rate of circulation of the product incorrectly, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of the circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest price difference was 844 forints.
This year the extreme difference did not manifest itself, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest undercut 1,284 forints.
Compared to both Christmas seasons, catastrophic price growth became apparent, in less than 20 months, daily consumption goods in hypermarkets undercut by more than 30 percent.
(This is not entirely confirmed, among other things, by the Central Statistical Office's data: it has measured a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the daily economy's consumer basket, it seems almost impossible, because the price level of the product, quite expensive as early as last year, showed barely 10 percent price growth due to the base even in the worst case.
Flour suppliers seem to take stronger positions than egg suppliers, drastic price increases have also been achieved in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the business gold triangle do not complain, still report on a good year.
In our experience, most customers in three visited shops are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything in quantity, they take durable foods at salaries.
On Wednesday morning, long queues were formed in all three supermarkets at the cash desks, as the number of visitors rose sharply.
However, as we know, rural turnover is lower, several international chains complain to research firms that revenues lag behind their plans, not only in the case of food but also durable consumer goods.
In many places it is saved on disinfectants
This year more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hospital hygiene conditions, bed overfilling, overburdening staff do not help with disease control, says the Chief of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places they also save on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibacterial-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who got into the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
Patient's been isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site early in the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria found in his body, one important surgery could not yet be performed.
By 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistance disease agents were reported to the Nesocomialis Surveillance National System, Karolina Böröczová, the Chief of the National Epidemiology Center, announced.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistance disease agents have been safely registered in hospitals, others are unknown.
Almost two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methiciline-oxacillin resistant to gold staphylococci.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry a third of the people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsil inflammation, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, it develops from a bacteria that respond well to antibiotics that are highly resistant to antibiotics and that spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, in case of transient or permanent poor functioning of the immune system in patients with weakened organisms, low body weight or in patients over the years, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are among the daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," Tibor Nyulasi said, "where the presence of the disease agent is not investigated."
Resisting Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, care personnel treat them in rubber gloves, and we have the antibiotics needed to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether they are present in their MRSA organism, however, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favourable to preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistance disease agents, argues Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs characteristically in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should immediately control the admitted patients and isolate MRSA carriers.
However, sampling of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in the fashion.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations also plays a role.
Most cases are thus revealed, if the patient suffers from noticeable MRSA infection, said the chief of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also home guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, or microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not do so in all cases.
The collection of microbiological samples is even more rare for basic and outpatient treatment, or outpatient treatment, was reported by Karolina Böröcz.
Saved on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most often through medical personnel.
Therefore, washing hands and using gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by both drip infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, unfortunately, we can also see that in hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation they are saving on disinfectants, nurses are few and patients are many, thus increasing the chances of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are demonstrably less or further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written a MRSA prevention program, respectively, to reduce its occurrence.
The program seems to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a declining trend.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks among its priorities the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistent disease agents (including MRSAs), respectively hospital infections caused by these disease agents.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official expert opinion in the case of police captain XXII. district, which caused a fatal accident, is complete.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed pedestrians on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his post, managed under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, informed the spokesman of the Attorney General of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert opinion of the case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which had already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
At the time, the director of the XXII Police Directorate struck down on Tuesday at Lajos Kossuth Street in the XXII District with his own car at the turn of a 55-year-old man who entered in front of him while crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The last named fact that the pedestrian passed outside the zebra, after all, according to road traffic rules there is no extenuating circumstances, the turning car must still give priority.)
After transport to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned and applied for retirement, according to police reports, because he was so shaken up by the case.
He is conducting an inquiry into the Budapest State Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had worked with prosecutors conducting investigations from the outset.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
On Friday in Budapest, Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed an agreement on three loan frameworks worth EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects implemented under the aid of the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the Treaty now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Also, for the budget financing of projects related to education, the EUR 150 million loan agreement is used.
The EIB has approved EUR 300 million for this purpose in total, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract for €50 million, which the budget will mainly apply to the research-development project of the University of Debrecín.
There was also a talk at the meeting about the 4th metro route.
The Parties agree that, after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, it will revert to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and no commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is stunning - the attention of the whole of Europe turns to a previously marginalised Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the still cheapest yet rapidly expensive EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European property purchase goal is now no doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
Most of the mountains are in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha, on the sea coast there are Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will be aroused by investors sooner or later, and more interested people will also buy in the area of the very cheap city of Ruse.
Also, the capital of Sofia is a promise of appealing options, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best path to turning into one of Europe's most attractive golf havens, thus becoming next to the summer and winter seasons the sought-after destination of trips in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are already shopping in large quantities, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present here, there are traditionally many Russian customers at the Black Sea and in ski havens.
Foreign buyer lez split into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth €50-100,000, or dilapidated old houses for €5-15,000, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important for them.
The second category are buyers of chat (Bulgaria was ranked among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of a rise in value in the medium- or long term.
Real estate management in the capital is continuous, as demand is getting stronger.
In Bulgaria, while the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are, they have increased by 21 percent annually over the last five years.
The increase in property prices significantly outweighs the increase in salaries.
Fodor and Hungarian 6 percent
According to information from the Minister for Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor will conclude meetings of experts on Tuesday, and the international conference on the climate regime will continue after 2012 after Wednesday's official launch with the meeting of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Travel Map, which addresses efforts following the period of reduction of emissions as defined by the Kyoto Protocol applicable until 2012.
At the moment, they are under heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not want to negotiate precise numbers now, although they tend to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020, given the 1990 status.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developed countries will also accept, in addition to reducing emissions, the provision of both material and technological assistance to countries that rely on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member Governing Board, most likely under the World Environmental Protection Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the Piac és Profit magazine.
Hungarian 6 percent
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in efforts to global climate protection and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, independently of the success of adopting the post-2012 'agreement', and is prepared to commit to a 30% reduction if other developed regions of the world, respectively, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments appropriate to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set the target of a 5.2 percent reduction, with the then 15 EU Member States committed to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will meet. - It is recalled in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
Bali is a big deal, because within two years there is a need to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would not be certain until 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new emission reduction system, the necessity of which the UN International Climate Change Scientific Council has also pointed out in its latest report - the IPCC, which is a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units publish video sharing recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan that popularize themselves.
First, YouTube liked British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, announced by the BBC.
Recordings, taken by a miniature camera mounted on a helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Headquarters controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable.
With this form, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have already been made online, and over 75,000 people have looked at their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings from events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peacekeeping units in Iraq (MFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Air forces have released videos according to their original intention to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence they are also good to familiarize the general public with the real goal of the presence of an army abroad.
"Promotion published in this form compared to traditional TV recruitment ads costs almost nothing," said BBC defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it necessarily also carries a political message in it, as it confirms the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government in a special form."
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully modified, censored recordings, amateur videos are also available on the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a bit of hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers are talking at most about losses, but there is no bloody form of struggle.
After all, many videos of the fighting sites in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a sharp deployment, have already been posted on the Internet, but the British military has only just come to them.
Americans recruit slightly differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through a more or less faithful simulation get directly into the skin of soldiers.
There's gonna be a Christmas with a raffle and poochies at the ministries.
The Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her colleagues, at which she will say goodbye to the pags and coffee in 2007.
At some ministries will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere will conjure up the holiday atmosphere of raffle and toast to officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - so the powerful are having fun.
The state authorities are preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will hold the most costly Christmas celebration this year, but it does not expect its employees.
At Christmas orphans will receive gifts from children of fallen soldiers, during the Missional Christmas will be hosted by family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will kick themselves out of the ditch compared to other resorts.
The GKM event is held in the centre of Jövő Haza, for a total of 4 320,000 forints and of six hundred employees of the Ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and a raffle will be drawn.
Christmas NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
The hall rental cost a million forints, the rest being spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: a tender company, the Hungarian Center for Economic Development (MAG) will organize it from EU money.
To this end, they rented the Vigszínház Theatre building.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information as we failed to reach the relevant person.
There's no need for a suit
The OIT building was not only hosted by NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held St Lucia's ball instead of Christmas on December 7.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
500 people attended the ball.
The party began with the health minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question portal [origo] at the ball were not mandatory evening dress or suit at all.
Puritan parties are being arranged by health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for 400,000 forint employees in its own building.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth even officially invites her co-workers to a Christmas party, but to a final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, which according to the press department's announcement only get coffee and pags, so only 350,000 forints will be sufficient for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his co-workers will simply toast in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas reunion, which expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he dedicates 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with buffets and a toast.
Since János Veres is Minister, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missed, officiality increases not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time.
The Agriculture Resort hosts a New Year's reception on January 20, and ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the City Orchards and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are intended for 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions start with a short health minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the [origo] portal was informed by the relevant press departments.
The award of Christmas celebrations to the Department of the Environment in the press department was not announced.
In any case, 400 people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Arts.
There's a giant strike coming up.
The Association of Trade Unions Liga, respectively the National Workers' Council Union (MOSZ) will form its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
A protest public assembly is held on Saturday, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious traffic interruptions, as rail transport will almost completely stop and employees of Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Association will introduce together the National Workers' Council Union with details jointly organized Monday's strikes.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, which will coordinate the event on Monday.
A protest public assembly is held on Saturday, and from Monday then the union joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period if there is no agreement with the government.
This means that there was no deadline for the termination of the strike, which will start on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament did not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions would immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if the legislation is voted, strike committees will meet to decide on the next step.
According to the Monday's agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will not be voted until late evening or late night.
Due to Monday's start-up strike, it is possible to count on serious traffic disruptions: on the railway the work will be stopped for an indefinite period, some of Budapest's public transport and more than half of Volán companies may stop in the morning.
At the same time, half of the road will also be closed in many places in the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil organisations joined the strike call, the list of which is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations have announced a strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary stop to work.
By Thursday afternoon, Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZZZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, while more and more people travel on the railway at the beginning of Christmas holidays.
According to previous communications, there will be a strike at BKV from the beginning of operation until 13:00, from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organised by the LIGA Energy Industry Union, calling for a 2- or 2-8-hour stop to work, respectively, by the Education Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers.
The Hungarian Medical Union will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), belonging to the Co-operation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by Liga is for the government to withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions should be introduced gradually from next year.
Third, to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the system prior to 2010.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), falling under the Liga trade union, does not accept the Ministry of Economy and Transport offer concerning railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Raised Country Risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért movement in August this year, according to the Division of Risk Analysis Division, the Political Capital Institute increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in several respects.
The "warning of risks" drawn up by the company states: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "the highlighting of already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Romani populations of Hungary may already take place in a short time with violent ethnic clashes".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to be directed towards provoke such an action - it adds the research institute.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligents of Hungarian political leaders: "public debate on the Roma issue has been left by representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict."
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the Institute judges.
Moreover, according to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard's activities, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, have "broken largely the image of Hungary abroad, particularly as regards belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have been receiving ever greater publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, is that several organizations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007, which are called self-organizations "national militias".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the event of natural disasters, attack of their homeland, disturbance of order), plus pointing to the inability of the police, army, or state," he adds.
He further notes: all this is done in a way that tries to wrap up various political efforts built on the opposition of society to politics and parties into civilian robes.
Thus, emphasising civility and the form of a society in the case of these groupings is not only designed to avoid legal difficulties in judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also a risk-enhancing factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, Hungary's Guards are pointing to several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policy by appealing to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so political risks to the area as a whole have increased.
As he writes, the Hungarian Guard's activity resembles, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roma riots that broke out in one of the Sofia neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
She used the BNU to establish a guard, saying that the organization's goal was "national militia".
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained dormant and indifferent, reminiscent of the Institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative sparked a heated discussion by the Bulgarian public.
As he further writes, an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guard as a sign of resistance.
As the Hungarian Guard's activity so far shows similarity to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read in a warning of the risks created by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, the research director of the Political Capital Institute, commented on the press office's inquiry: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analyses are issued each year and if they find anything that might affect risk change, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk alert.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, days of leave are precisely laid down by law and it has become a general practice that working days are being moved around the holidays, which is less likely to happen next year.
In the European Union and in America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and days of peace of mind.
The days of peace are usually tied to church holidays or to significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year with us: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is a work day - on the New Year so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
In the course of the year, we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15 celebrating the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, a memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the establishment of the state, on May 1st work, on November 1st and 2nd, we remember deceased relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day Easter, Pentecost and Christmas holidays.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays rarely come to a weekend, it has become a practice to move a working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price for extended weekends is that we remain in the workplace and in school the previous Saturdays.
The day immediately preceded or followed by the festival will be worked out by the Minister of Labour for many years in a special decree.
The legislation shall apply equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to public servants and to public servants.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, in view of their designation, operate even in days of rest.
This year, there will be a change in the working order only around the end of the year: from 24 December life in the country will almost stop, because, according to experience, most people will "work" or take advantage of the holiday they have saved in advance between Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Next year, several of our holidays fall into the middle, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be transformed around the holiday of work so that the workers can then stay home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, may be a rest day.
The next move is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will be working instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year, however, will be able to take place completely in the sign of the holidays next year, because from 24 December they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays despite the fact that New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six scary little things to piss off your colleagues
The e-mails we forget to send, the voice messages we never receive, the innocent lies we hardly notice any more: all of this makes weekdays more commonplace in the workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these minor inconveniences or put on gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry with, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that the marketing department was looking for you," a colleague will tell you.
That you missed the meeting for this?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
The most common thing is one apology.
Before it comes to embarrassing apologies, it is good to think about how you could prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues, knowingly trying to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than when you reach out for a document, office use, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table of one of your colleagues your pens that you thought were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they'll be rightfully angry at you for going through their stuff.
Do not remove envelopes or adhesives from your office because it may be uncomfortable if you run out of them prematurely, and you will need them immediately.
Talk about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop rumors.
Who, who, what was he doing with?
Where and why?
Don't put your reports on everyone's nose about the private life of colleagues!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even if others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and refer to a severe headache, report your absence because you are not feeling well, or think that today you would prefer to rest, think that your work, urgent tasks and work that they have a certain term will have to be done for you by someone else.
Have regard for your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something can happen that you will have to stay home for, report it so that your colleagues and the manager are not confronted with your absence the next day.
Grouchy, giggley, phone calls
Did you dive into a job that's gonna rip you out of the giggles of your colleagues?
You accidentally witnessed a phone conversation that would be better to not hear at all?
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming, chanting, talking loudly (they are above their heads), or stomping, constantly curtsy, loud discontent.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not currently involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If something is not on time or you forget to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to any office chaos and deaf colleagues!
Admit it if you've made mistakes and someone's paid for it, and correct the damage!
Ask how you could fix things, correct negligence!
Do you feel too at home in your office?
Tracksuits and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not suitable for office!
Do not wear leisure clothes even if your profession allows it!
Do not be negligent, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in a common dress - and if your profession requires it, nicely and gracefully!
When you want to be comfortable, you stop being interesting.
Driving in the usual morning traffic.
A special tune will be heard from the radio: the sound of a violin to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes pace and bass is added to the previous tone coloring, then a women's choir joins in as a real jewel.
There is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love at the mr2 station.
Home music has not been spoiling us with quality electronic pop for a long time.
Suddenly, the traffic seems quite different because you're listening to the new Zagar album.
The Yonderboie apparition, a few new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the picture, and although it is again in the fashion of garage rock with its beat-up guitar, home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Příkostelí and he also played in Yonderboi's band until finally - perhaps because two pacifiers can't fit in one row - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ference Töröka "Szezon").
His formation, playing in beginnings in smaller clubs, recognized the wider audience after the magazine wan2 ranked their first 2002 album among the 50 most important home records and declared Zagar in Yonderboie to be almost the only domestic entities determining developments that could be sold even in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt "on course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded as it belonged: she made a new, better album.
Now released album titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new ways for them, although the name itself tries to create continuity with initial flights in the Fivepostel.
This is one verse from the composition of the old band Balázs Zságer.
A reference to ethereal, flying would be in place, but alongside the ethereal touch of this music, it has now appeared - in harmony with the spirit, trend of the time - a louder guitar, influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, presented himself at the premiere of the album in Millenéris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, which has been playing popular music from morning to evening, we started to enjoy the muffled tunes of Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is all right?).
The portal hvg.hu interviewed Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, there is a question of how much what you play remains by marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music means little to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can only be produced for sale, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop track can stem from an honest inner need.
In this spirit, there is also a position as adopted, regardless of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially west of us, light music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers and 20 - year - olds go to concerts there.
Much more follow the transformations of light music taking place around them, as they also regard it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who listens to your music, where and how much?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a goal, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more in concerts where mutual influence is already working, but it is hidden only in the insatiable transformations of the moment.
Still, I noticed that when one wants to please the audience, from that point on, one ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How far are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works solo and built his career more west of us.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain.
We're more like team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let it develop.
At first, of course, we could not avoid our work being compared to Yonderboi's compositions, for several of us separated from his band and went another way.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the mr2 station Petőfi, the song Wings of Love came first.
Many first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
In a more popular way, have you consciously opened up to wider layers?
B.Z.: We didn't plan on writing a hit to sell the record.
There's more to that song.
We intended it as the album finale, by which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The idea was to create such gospel choir.
Then came the idea to assemble this choir from the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir came together - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized on Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls reshape something about it?
B.Z.: The song has long existed in an instrumental version, when the material on the record was then gathered, we thought that there would be something more to this song.
A succession of chords tempted the singing part to join him.
The other night, I sang a tune to him that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost the first time, and it was very spontaneous.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course it took Wonders to do it.
It wouldn't work that vigorously with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together and they're not louder than music, so the music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They also stood in the back of the stage.
Is that on purpose?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only because of technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we did not want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even that song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where who's from, where they belong, and just letting those wings, love wings rise.
I wanted this euphoric state that we felt when that song was born to be felt by others.
hvg.hu: Which one was the most busy with?
B.Zs.: During composing music actually not with one, harder pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for long, then everything found its place in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new record is your favorite?
B.Z.: This is still changing with the concerto and the fact that I've already "released" the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions of inferiority
Treacherous defraudant.
This is what Jerome Kerviel's former employee is called the French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka.
She lost almost five billion euros because of him.
Rather, Kerviel seems to have been just a big player who wanted to settle for colleagues and, moreover, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally weaker," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who sent the police after him.
However, as Kerviel’s statement, which was made by French media, such as the daily Le Monde, shows, was a person who at the end of last year had a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros on the American crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that the so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or to those who have had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis did not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet it right.
At the end of the year, its profits then climbed up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Since I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything for himself.
In all the interrogations, he admits he faked the records so he wouldn't be found out.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though Eurex became interested in his business.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd find out?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to gradually work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, he knew he'd never make as much money as anyone else.
"Already at my first interview in 2005 I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after the onset came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he made half a billion euros in London's bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But they said the bosses knew about everything, or rather they suspected.
"As long as I was making money, they were closing their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a holiday is a broker who doesn't want anyone looking into his records," Kerviel closed.
The Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can raise EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go into traffic.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will run with CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and firms to raise funds for innovative business.
Companies should raise funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the current drawdown of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful within the newly accepted countries.
A 20-year sentence for ex-president Nicaragua has been confirmed by the court
An appeal court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed a twenty-year sentence for former president of Arnold Aleman's country, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (almost CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 goes back to prison, the AP is not clear at the moment.
According to the chairman of Ileana Pérez's Court of Appeals, it will now depend on prison officials whether they let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in fact to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Aleman based on funding his election campaign in 2001.
That's how they approved the budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He passed last year with the support of the ČSSD, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford his non-adoption.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote on government mistrust, nothing dramatic was going on this time.
The Chamber of Deputies approved this traditionally overlooked, although most influential, law calmly.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget appropriations, whether someone likes it or doesn't like it.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power rivalry of government with the opposition.
This is more media grateful and therefore he pays much more attention in the media.
The argument of politicians is much more interesting to the public than a few figures.
The state budgets in past Social Democratic governments suffered from three ills, which for 2008 are suddenly unable to resolve:
The first is a high share of the law of mandatory, so-called mandatorous expenditure, which is not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM last year before the election.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first malaise.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. the deficit in urban and municipal budgets.
However, the greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to money from taxes, fees, and loans from banks, gain additional resources for investment, often recklessly issuing bonds by which they disproportionately owed their town hall.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other distribution networks that they have received from the State from privatisation.
They no longer have this source.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, boasting about the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put the public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state owed more and more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more rationally than our Republic.
It is a huge disgrace that falls primarily on the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have been completely unnecessary in recent years.
Although part of the senseless populist spending, approved this year before the elections, has succeeded in abolishing the pension and pension reform border in the near future, then any policy in this country will in fact end and whoever is in charge of it will be mere office.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the extrusion of normal spending through mandatorial.
A planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not spent what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want to see government politicians become mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not very strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can earn on taxes and charges, calm to prepare other reform laws.
Only these will allow a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland, and Canada decided together to combat the financial market crisis.
Thus, more than $100 billion will reach monetary markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank auctions an interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion, then make the next twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is after the September 11 attacks for the first time that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move is intended to address the biggest economic difficulties, a growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baušol wrote in his report to clients from the consultancy company Economic Outlook Group.
"Coordinated Central Bank action reduced the probability of recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Bausol added in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billion losses.
"Central banks must be really worried about what else can follow when they decided to do this," said the chief economist ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with potential impacts on the economic growth of the world.
Central banks decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, despite the fact that central banks of the US, Canada, and Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting to Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank's move will contribute to the crisis's elimination, because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are incredible
Global climate change is intended to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now come to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he stated that environmental debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which forms a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality, is unacceptable.
"Debata there is completely unstructured, it's just fireworks words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that her topic is very important to him and that is why he is so involved with them.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my views".
So now interested persons can read his unbiased attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but, in his opinion, he had enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess expert treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a nationalist.
He called the main conclusions of the book the thesis that the climate is constantly changing, and so its changes are normal, that there is no consistent view of the planet's warming by all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a man with experience in totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the questions present that he was not opposed to "reasonable environmental protection, but to militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people didn't change their license.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not have time to change the old driver's license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request that the authorities be able to issue them a new card by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would take the road after the New Year without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged mainly by those who don't even want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of a license, the authorities in the metropolis are buried in requests and interest in the exchange of a licence has increased this week.
The Magistrate checks in around 2,000 clients a day.
There's about half an hour in the queues.
In Prague, approximately 140,000 drivers have not exchanged their driver's license.
It takes 20 days to issue a new license.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a short period of five days.
In that case, however, the driver will pay extra 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the mandatory exchange of their license by the end of the year and leave on the road without a valid driver’s license will be subject to a fine as of January.
The guilty will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But a policeman can also deal with a misdemeanor by arrangement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will rise to CZK 2500.
According to earlier information, even a person who's not going anywhere could get a ticket from City Hall.
It was said that he could pay even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum thousand-year fine.
According to Transport Department spokesman Karl Hanzelka, however, tens of thousands of fines are not a threat to anyone.
According to him, driving licence is a document for which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not an ID that every person has to have in force.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver's license.
Just take it or send it by registered mail to the competent municipal authority.
At the end of the year, the passes issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
Motorists, however, must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is roughly 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are charged with criminal association with David Berdych's gang, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
It was definitively decided by the Prague Supreme Court, which thus reduced their sentences, one by a year and the other by two years.
Originally threatening detectives of the Prague Department for the fight against organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
There is no appeal against today's decision, only a summons to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also being charged in this case, but he is waiting for a first-instanstial verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already received sentences in excess of 16 years.
That's all he gets.
The Regional Court in January recognized particularly from participation in robbery by guilty 19 people, the Supreme Court today dealt with appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have rejected the prosecution since the start of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement, inter alia, with Berdych, passed information on to criminals from police sources, covered up individual robbery and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Koňarík for it out of the dandruff.
In the prosecution, it is a gang crime from 1999 to 2001.
Especially the robbery, whose victims often suffered serious injury to their health, but also the abuse of the authority of a public official and the illicit armament.
During home searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel core missiles, laser sighting or machine gun.
The gang, according to the allegations, came in for tens of millions of crowns by robbery.
In addition to nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already definitively recognized the guilty of other Berdych robberies and a number of other people.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood have yet to confess in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to trial.
The main trial has thus far avoided Tomáš Pout and Maroš Šulej, who reside in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a final decision on their extradition to be prosecuted into the Czech Republic.

For replacing the children in the maternity ward, the lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleba wants 12 million crowns for compensation after the Trebe hospital, plus court expenses.
For each of the mothers of three million, for the father of two million, and for the children of one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ondrej Dostál, the hospital's attorney, strongly disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," said Dostál after today's meeting.
"But in order to get an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty had drawn up.
Let's see if it has any telling value at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the statistics for all," Dostál emphasized.
According to him, the amount should range between CZK 100,000 to CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month when she did not raise her biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for negotiations on the compensation expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motola.
The parents of children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress at various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, even when they faced with regrets that they had not prevented the replacement of newborns.
In turn, women are having a hard time coping with the topicality of the trauma and with what is happening right now, he summarized the content of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the Tříběch obstetrics last December 9.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáků do Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová do Jabloňov.
Hejtman Vysočiny Miloš Stuck each of the families CZK 100,000 in late October to compensate the expenses incurred by them by the mistake of the Tříbe hospital, which the county is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In the event of errors, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they may seek the assistance of the institution.
The courts have so far granted relatively low compensation to people, the sums have been calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup lost the Wallachian kingdom
Bolek Soup lost the dispute over the Valashian Kingdom brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, for the first time he used the designation Wallachian King, but the project was built by a long-time team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
Soup didn't take part in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client appeals.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabish and his team parasitize on Bolk's Soup popularity," said the lawyer after the Soup trial.
According to him, everyone remembers actors and comedians in the words of the Wallachian Kingdom.
Harabish feels the same way.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Collecting money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could get something out of it.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative Business
According to the court, the Wallachian King first used the Soup on his television show.
It was crowned in 1993 by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this was not related to the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
Years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionist event turned out to be a business and lucrative business activity, to which Harabiš followed the establishment of the Wallachian Kingdom Company.
In 1997 Soup agreed to state its name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts while visiting their farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabish had only used the bare idea that Soup published in the mane for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslava The soups of the Wallachian Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that Harabish and his team were the soul of the project, which was intensively dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today’s demolished parties continued until 2000, when Harabish organized official coronation in Vsetín for Soup.
Since then, however, disputes have begun to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the overthrow of the "King of Boleslava I chosen forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by singer Jarmila Šuláková as queen mother at the initiative of Harabiš.
In 2002, Soup then filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clearly, Harabish could bring about the upcoming campaign for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
Details and deadline haven't been revealed yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be like riding kings on Slováck.
The king should be elected for a period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can volunteer," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi Test: Vanishing Preconceptions
In fact, I've never been much of a fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, gear quality, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But there is now a successor to Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And a station wagon called SW goes a little further, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about, for example, the head space in the back seats.
That's the end of the complaint here, because the bodywork of the estate means that even two-metre tall people will not suffer in this direction.
♪ Flying the world ♪
I'll move the interior very quickly so I don't repeat too much.
This is a pretty good design, where I have only one complaint about a poor middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design invention here, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side line also improved significantly against model 206.
What about space and here is the increase in body dimensions.
In the estate, the already mentioned lack of head space disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
So the main thing on this car is his baggage carrier.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (even thanks to the tilting rear window) and as well as as properly stored.
Deaf places are equipped with rubber restraints, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be extended and it can hold even heavier objects.
But let's take a look at the volume together.
This is according to the tables in the basic layout of 428 l, which is more of an average value against competition.
However, not against the Czech best-selling car of this class - Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot lags a lot noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I were to raise the positives, I still have to mention the floor completely flat after lowering the second row backrests or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre spark ignition four-cylinder with 88 kW power.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old girl should look like who drives a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low-consumption, and above all, it's pulling.
If I compare it to a harmful equivalent that sometimes acts as if she had a stuffed rag in her exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
Price list hints
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a positive fourteen-pointer for CZK 329 900 is still good.
Our aggregate costs CZK 410,900, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment then throws in the equipment for another 80,000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper triggers, electric rear window control...
It's just a car costing all of it CZK 531,900.
It's a lot, but count the extra gear at Fabie's and you'll get a lot like that.
So all we have to do is make a mark.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, children from Eastern European countries are growing, which raises concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
The integration of the East Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of indigenous people grow into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools illustrates well the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying, and skirmishes among pupils were also transferred into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The guilty defends himself against being insulted by racist insults.
Police had to intervene even after attacking two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls reportedly made racist remarks and threw rocks at him.
"When we went home, some boy climbed up to a bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he came at us with apples and pears, and then he revealed his ass," another unpleasant event for The Times, the mother of Slovak pupils, described.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even called disputes with eastern European immigrants a struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrant countries is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who headed here for work.
Roughly 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba The most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation can be done if you choose the right way.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters, offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the islands of the Caribbean, you will find it in a full and even richer list.
But only on one island will you find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba used to be a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus described her as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure warehouse and transshipment site that the Spanish robbed and transported to Europe in America.
And then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel grew up at the very end of the 1920s.
He had it built by one of America's Mafia chiefs Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were me.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses grew in Havana, cars that belonged to the iconic symbols of the 1950s were traveling on wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and in Cojamar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, both show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, they make you a cocktail as you wish.
And those cult cars from the 1950s have been driving in Havana so far, because once imported giggles and fiats in that salty and humid air have rotted long ago.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part of it, is very dilapidated, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places also turn into beauty, such as Trinidad.
As tourism brings much money needed, its development is green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially on Varadera, on the coast of Holguín Province, as well as on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pleasure, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
A third of the vast plantations were transported to sugar factories on narrow rails by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been restored for decades, so there are working machines whose peers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
And so about Varader or Havana, there's not much to say about.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingway homestead and whoever likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Vinales Valley One of Cuba's most picturesque parts is the Vinales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone subsoil.
Mogotes, limestone homoles and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and in their cavities a fertile soil caught, making even the weathered rocks covered with dense growth.
The valley is where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see its final form if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Perhaps some find it interesting that there was a Chilean episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has become the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that there was still no road in the 1950s that connected that county to the rest of the country.
She's helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was broken, everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places nearby, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening it is possible to go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it is quiet over the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba some call it the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion is certainly affected by the journey itself.
Both roads that run there from Guantánamo have to overcome the high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that human activity has scarcely affected.
The Eastern Expansion of Cuba included UNESCO due to its intact nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have Columbus Cross (in fact originated about a hundred years after Columbus Cruise) and down the hill where the former castle and the present-day El Castillo hotel stand are seen several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isle of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions that profess the descendants of former slaves, there could be many pages about all of this.
But, as they say, it's better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, say Americans
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment influence the mission in Afghanistan according to the United States.
NATO, according to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, should outline a concrete plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not carried out as planned, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to increasing opposition from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are today discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to do more, the UK sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow residents to start further economic and security development themselves," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC station.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is, according to U.S. military figures, the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, even 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have roughly 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which roughly a quarter in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to seriously reflect on specific targets for the next time and ways to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and the equipment we need, and that's not enough," Reuters De Hoop said at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
There have also been controversy among the participating countries in recent months as to whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for passivity.
"Germans have quite numerous representations in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan loafers revealed: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went into counterattack and printed a photo of the British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the state debt is over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to improved development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months of this year it thus increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
As of June, however, it decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
Thus, the Ministry of Finance today confirmed its figures on the state debt from early October.
Every Czech has a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
In the whole last year, the state owed more than CZK 111 billion.
"For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could not overcome the CZK trillion limit until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between CZK 900 billion and a trillion," said iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek.
Similarly, next finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it: "We could get to over one trillion in 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more money, it could shift to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Debts Are Growing
The government debt forms the central government's debts and is created primarily by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
State debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has so far increased by 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion this year.
The state's foreign debt has so far increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion this year.
The so-called negotiable state debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and fell by CZK 13.7 billion as of June.
The average government debt maturity increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt grew 13 percent year-on-year for the first to third quarters, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that it will be what to trade with when there is a pension reform," Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The strategy of financing and managing government debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to improved development of the state budget.
The amount mainly consists of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the projected CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion pension reserve, the funding of CZK 43 billion of government bonds and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is scheduled to appear today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher, tried in Sudan for insult to Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday night by a Khartoum Tribunal and expelled, as her attorney stated.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils name the Teddy Bear Mohamed despite any depiction of the Prophet Islam being forbidden.
She was subjected to whiplash.
This British 45-year-old teacher, working at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insults to Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old students to choose the name for the class teddy bear.
"Eight names from the children's mouth, including Hasan, Abdullah, and Mohamed", says school principal Robert Boulos.
After the class vote, 20 out of 23 children eventually select Muhammad as the most popular name.
Of course Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but it is, above all, a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a teddy bear accompanied by a label: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no label with that name on it, but the trouble is in the very depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One fellow Muslim Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, specified that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked children to vote for a name", according to him, it is merely an "innocent misconduct".
This opinion is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "never in the class talks about religion".
Let us recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most often given first name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way to honor the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended their sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement", stated European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to keep their commitments to peace and be prepared for dialogue even after the negotiations ended.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period", he added, adding that "it is evident that the situation is tense".
Negotiations expire on 10 December
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be on their way to Kosovo on Monday for the last time.
The future of the province, where 90 percent are Albanian-speaking populations, could appear in a clearer light as of December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
Interviews in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, commissioned the Troika with new negotiations.
Americans and Europeans are counting on talks to be concluded on December 10.
On the other hand, the Russians, who previously blocked Kosovo’s independence in the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue even after this final deadline.
"Russia was and remains inclined to deal negotiated, compromise solution", said Bocan-Charchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community administration, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in favour of it, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on widespread autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have reached no agreement", announced the President of the Kosovo Authority Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden hotel, where this "last chance deal" took place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan introduced by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise still comes into consideration and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the independence wars in the 1990s.
"It doesn't mean that for Serbia," he said, "the compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"Kosov parliament will have last word"
"For Serbia, only solutions arising from the Security Council are acceptable", Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the Security Council's soil."
Fatmir Sedjiu replied to reporters that "the last word on status would be the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking residents, it would be "after agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal on Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened on his impulse, U.S. President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed to immediately open negotiations with the intention of resolving a 60-year dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy 'terrorist infrastructure' and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush stated and recalled the obligations that flow for both sides from the 'road map' to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues without exception, including central issues".
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled in the 1948 conflict from their homes in the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took up the word after the American President and emphasized that the subsequent negotiations were "total and thorough" and to touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Then Olmert spoke on the bleachers, who expressed his position that the ensuing negotiations should be "straight and continuous" and that it is necessary to "take a look at it being concluded during 2008".
Bush determined the end of 2008 as the deadline for the realization of his "vision of two states", a Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had taken a commitment from Bush to this effect before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries offering peace to Israel in exchange for abandoning all Arab territories taken during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in Middle East history especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saud in an interview he provided to an Arabic-speaking diary shielded by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, police officers don't take responsibility.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspection of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car passed through the Louise-Michel street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday shortly after 17:00.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but was on patrol and passed at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, without side lights on", explains the police source.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unincorporated and therefore without permission to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without helmets, passed through "very high speed".
"Motocycle rammed from left side into police car after favoring from right", specified one policeman.
The blood alcohol test performed on the crew of the vehicle proved negative.
The condition of the car (cut front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) is indicative of the sharpness of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "the acts of unintentional manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons at risk", which is also being taken up by the direction départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (directory of the Val d'Oise County Police Department).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by IGPN ruled out, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three witnesses of the accident who were questioned on Sunday night, according to the clerk, confirmed "a version of police officers, namely that the minimotor had approached them quite quickly from the left".
A groove, no doubt caused by rubbing clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the moment the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
There was an autopsy on both victims' bodies yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a rapid spread of talk among the people that police officers should have left the scene quickly without providing first aid to two youngsters.
IGPN should, in all caution, also exclude "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"It is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more research and with which to be very careful", said the police source.
The diary "Liberation" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows runs right where the accident happened.
"Immediately, my cousin and I, who is a nurse in the hospital, ran downstairs to try to resurrect them", says the Witness.
We couldn't do anything".
Then he saw "a limping, completely terrified cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the youngsters and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with rapidly increasing tension and certainty that the situation of the youngsters was hopeless, police officers were taken by the car of colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the officers left".
They also did a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush the youngsters to help.
These youngsters were first aided.
The fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them", stressed the prosecutor.
Tensions in Pakistan Increase
Pakistan police suppressed the first demonstration on Monday since the announcement of a state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers, demonstrating against measures taken in an emergency state, grenades with tear gas were injured, which, according to witnesses, used the order forces.
The last names answered with stones, thus injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been subpoenaed.
Similar scenarios like Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, attorneys of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were overturned Monday morning, in order to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyer movement gained the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "instigated the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the exceptional condition, and garbage to those who took the oath before Musharraf".
"Musharraf's promise does not apply"
The Pakistan Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election that took place on October 6.
The President of Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry Court was removed and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and against Supreme Court judgments", said an official in The News.
Parvíz Musharraf's promise to surrender to the military leadership and become civilian president,"doesn't apply" after introducing an emergency condition, on Monday, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem declared.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential mandate ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government otherwise refuted in a country of ongoing speculation, according to which the Deputy Chief of the Army was to order President Musharraf to house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy still forms an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected today, revealing studies conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined)- The State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, estimates Ined.
After all, the regulation of contraception allowed for better "fertility control", the Institute argues, and notes that the level of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between 20 and 44 years of age has reached 60% today from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight out of ten births are well planned today.
One couple out of five even has the birth calculated per month exactly and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant season for the birth of the child.
Remarkable Space Station Repair
For more than seven hours of spacework, astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed a remarkable repair of the ruptured solar panel necessary for the station's further scientific activity.
It was a risky climb into space, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned and the rates of "skilling" the astronauts spent on repair.
Trouble occurred on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is some kind of landing pier for modules-laboratories.
These, however, need to be supplied by electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate a seventeen-and-a-half-ton electricity-producing module using solar panels already located on the ISS, to anchor at its final station.
After it was relocated, the crew began to decompose the 75-metre solar panels of the module.
And in that one of the panels, decomposing like a pulling harmonica, as a result of a cable snap, was damaged on an area of nearly one meter.
Decomposition was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally to perform a control output to the Discovery ship, and subsequently go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to engage in a damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go flying to the end of the robot arm of the ship, added to the station's shoulder, and performed a repair.
He is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalker) of the American Aviation and Space Bureau (NASA).
Tall, strong, very skillful, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" a "torn" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed on damaged places a sort of "snaps".
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the balancing chamber, and also from within, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, namely a mini-hockey wrapped with an insulating device to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and "after a handyman" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely decomposed and then invented its tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday as scheduled.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are losing heavily on the Paris Stock Exchange after this airline company, operating in the aviation and defence industries, announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to face delays in the A400M aircraft.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was forced to reconsider its expected production results for 2007 due to delays arising from slow progress towards the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the initial flight.
The cost of alleviating delays in the delivery of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was calculated "to EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European EADS designer.
Due to these costs, the EADS, next Thursday, will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before deducting interest and taxes (EBIT) when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponded to a six-month delay.
Let us recall that EADS production results fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the giant A380.
Originally, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft would be provided to the French Army in October 2009.
Decisions for status quo
Sunday elections will take place without tense expectation: the Russians will majority elect President Putin's side, United Russia.
Confirming so, after the end of the very little free election campaign, its aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the House of Commons, Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a pre-recorded television message to voters at public stations, but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so from the position of leader of the United Russia, the Prokremel Party, which apparently celebrates a overwhelming victory.
When he received ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president let nothing out of him and settled for another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the prize of true democracy and wish for honest, as transparent and as open as possible, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty", he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennadij Zjuganov says that "never had such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin".
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, according to her attorney, she continues to have no visitors.
"Russians remain the mentality of homo sovietica"
Two far more open questions are being profiled in the background of these parliamentary elections of simple tense expectations:
- "Who will become Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful party of United Russia, who chooses government and president?
One way or another, the outgoing ruling power will win the whole line in parliamentary, as well as in the presidential election.
It's a tradition.
"Russ remains the mentality of homo sovietica, does not feel masters of his destiny", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Sankt-Pepětburg observes more distant contexts: civil society has gained, in this country, christened five centuries after Europe, a delay; the famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After liberal reforms from the 1990s, "Putin followed the paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so that this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by some economic well-being", argues Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are "volunteeringly giving up personal responsibility" today, which they demonstrated briefly after the collapse of the USSR.
"What's to think about?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 Russian regional leaders) drive local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Čednchenko, a 45-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Compressed memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, recounting the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, open to the public.
47 million archival documents stored 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have been accessible by this time only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
Eleven states responsible for managing archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the ratification process for this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to explore "especially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Cimité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were opposed to accessing these nominal documents to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or warrants drawn up by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labour subjected to civil citizens, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are still dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents", said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin's Technische Universität in 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve free trade agreements in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India is almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Treaty in 2008, and European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath have announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the Commission the green light to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU's ninth trading partner.
"Free Trade Agreement enormously dopes both economies" and "India gets better access to the 450 million prosperous Europeans market", commented Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specified by the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants will exchange "€47 billion in goods" and "€10 billion in services" each year, stated Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India will meet at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosa on Friday.

The English bank took note of the concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the Bank of England made it clear that it intended to alleviate the current concerns that credit market conditions would worsen again and to announce a bid of £10 billion in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75 %, a bid valid unusually long.
"In order to ease concerns that financial market conditions will be very adverse at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in the way they secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", announced in the Communication.
The bank states that £10 billion (€14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time BOE pumps cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They normally last a week.
BOE adds in its communication that "it remains ready to take further measures to maintain interest rates on a daily basis" of interbank loans at the same level as its basic rate.
The inter-day interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest figure since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, sums have been placed on the financial market by the Bank of England associated with fee rates that discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation reinforced by the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many preferred to opt for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for the People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Center) refuse to deal with Socialists' (PS) proposals on purchasing
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss the various paragraphs of the Socialist Bill on Purchaseability, which equals the rejection of the text.
The text of the bill came on the agenda of the day as part of the so-called Socialist Nest (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, which included an increase in the employment premium of 50%, a renewal of the fluctuating TIPPs, a transport cheque or rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against the deliberations of each paragraph (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate that became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television appearance on purchasing.
PS MP Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act to be discussed by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, he announced this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Festival of the British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a person who inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration", revealed Charlie Jones from C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm with an area of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, then in 2006 the Festival Republic established the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Beginning in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also in charge of production, licenses and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of as many as 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event" ever experienced and says his firm and Melvina Benna are working concurrently to give the region a European style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We were dealing with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, due to the current leadership of the city, we got caught up in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Unfortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and are about to establish a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the residents of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after excelling on the festival scene by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 were 9.8M$ and 11.3M$.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European Melvin Benna Festival model takes place in the countryside while our festivals take place more in green spaces in cities", says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the impression of the rural festival after European and urban after Americanism."
Vineland is located roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland municipality, including mayor, enthusiastically supports the realization of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, saying "they are profitable enough to allow investment in such an event and welcome the festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which accommodates 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is just released to the press.
"Vineland will have a rock breath, but the music will be varied there to attract as far as possible a wide range of viewers", says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's tasks.
His mandate, however, is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall into "Governor"'s claws?
"It is necessary to be careful, it is the industry who decides where he goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will consider best", he said.
Hunting for festivals
For the moment, however, Denise Turcottea's priority is to promote the local film.
The Oscar hunt has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether they are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing Québec films, drawing attention to them and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
The Age of Darkness a few weeks ago had good publicity at the 30th Annual Mill Valley Film Festival.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be introduced in November at the 30th annual Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also introduced four short screens and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experts split the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors already have my hands in anticipation of a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock exchange has a positive course".
However, it is not appropriate to produce forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, certain doubts".
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange will move in recent weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market maintains the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially solid income affected by the effect of turnover on quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the exchange will have a rather quiet course, not without volatility, "especially because the impact of the likely fall in FED rates (Federal Reserve), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of stimulus to inflation pressures is unknown".
Javier Barrio, the head of the sale of BPI bank in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to make bold statements that there will be a marathon.
"There are not many reasons to rejoice", assures this expert.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed to 15,944,7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst for Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points due to portfolio regrouping and traditional supplementary pension deposits that occur each year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, as he believes that the marathon will occur sooner, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The analyst in question does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst of Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are getting closer to technical levels and "that is why we could observe the reflection of the index generated by US reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will ensure that they bring Ibex to the new maximum kótáma.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "the year is up to strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction firms in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industry sector.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been regaining position for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will follow the same path", explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, this expert believes that technology will also do very well, although they are not very well represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of downfall in two cases.
The actual marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see yet whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year (Ibex has so far increased by 8.36% since January), and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular bank will open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a major change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30.
BBVA, another group, which also assured several times that it wanted to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, he intends to enter into an agreement with the union to cancel the opening hours of 75% of his branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular bank will be decisive for other players to join this initiative, which supports opening hours of business, or not.
This is exactly what the project was designed by Popular Bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new branches, but only the adjustment of existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernise the branches it already has in business zones by adapting them to the client profile on individual streets.
This complements the extension of opening times with a different concept of branch space and new, more recent design in lighter colours.
Ángel Rivera’s business director assures that this restructuring will not constitute a large investment, but more recruitment, as it is passed from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Selected were branches in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seems that it was a happy choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialised immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónica to sell cell phones through external personnel.
Telecinco doubled the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time on the stock market
We did it.
By this sentence, yesterday Paolo Vasile, executive chairman of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction in the conclusion of the trade, stating that the television he manages doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoils his joy: 'what I'm sorry for is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we dropped less', he stated.
And he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday by a shift of 2.54%.
This profit shifted their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with Vocent's participation (another 13%) is EUR 4,488.88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5% overall since January, has a half value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (Publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in ratings'.
Telecinco announced last week that it was counting on overcoming billions of gross advertising revenue to become the first television channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that provides advertising to the group.
If the forecast figures were actually achieved, this TV channel would see an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (which amounted to 734.4 million), while the net income of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One factor on which analysts focus, for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock market, is the increased pay out that it has retained: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevaría, split among its shareholders 100 % of its profits.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always reported much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some weariness at these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates, namely 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected income growth from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antena 3, namely 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Ibersecurity: recommends buying both titles mainly on the basis of increased dividend yield and sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco better (assemble) than Anten 3 (maintain) due to its 'number of advantages' and trade growth.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases recommends not to overestimate them, as they face 'similar threats' (overrun market and degraded economic environment).
Congress approved MiFID transposition valid from 1 November
In parallel to parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today by the Congress vote on amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government subjected a public hearing to a regulation developing a new law, in order for both to enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the parties have consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities required for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, foresees modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial consultancy services to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and will create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultancy companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities brokering offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of operations with financial instruments is widened by adding multilateral trading systems and orders internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stockbrokers.
Furthermore, the Act obliges investment services companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and methods of dealing with risk, and requires a statement of all transactions carried out to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the negotiations on the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which the securitised claims were considered to be a "complicated" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high risk mortgage debts (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the directive was used to legally establish the functions that bachelors in the field of economics and corporate governance can hold for 30 years after a royal decree was passed in 1977, setting out professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has ranked the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and customer acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to Eurostat and Central European Bank (CEB) policy to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated as using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute of Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is merely indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be known on December 14 of this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president of the government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes stated that the November ISC increase to 4.1% was a "temporary number", but at the same time predicted that the price index would continue to be at relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes made it clear in the coloars of Congress that "although it will not be a favorable figure", Spain's inflation differential towards monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%", said the Minister for Economic Affairs on the data submitted today.
Virgin plans to make 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (16.8 billion).
At that time, the bank managed record deposits worth over £25 billion, which gradually declined within two and a half months, despite the fact that the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces the name of the entity with its trademark Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks over the next three years, in order to obtain the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
The Richard Branson tycoon group, known in the United Kingdom with its conspicuous advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to reach its resolution.
Northern Rock Bank marked this week's Virginia consortium offer, which makes up three other companies, as those who prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices during construction
The Civilian Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcian city of Totana (the People's Party) today in the early morning hours due to his alleged involvement in corruption practices during construction that were unveiled this week.
Furthermore, one of the town hall's secretaries and the chief of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales in May of this year, the current People's MP and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources addressed by Cadena SER television, could have been the 'head' of the entire company.
Police officers continue to monitor city hall buildings and construction commissions, and further arrests are not excluded in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect in corruption practices during construction, was charged with being exposed early this week.
As Caden SER, the lawyer of 'human' MP Juan Morales, who was vetted yesterday, was arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to investigative sources, Morales' alleged commission collection is subject to investigation for his signature of a construction agreement with a Galician construction firm that has been overqualified by 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are being detained at the moment.
Bono accepted the bid to stand at the head of Toledo's PSOE candidate and, if they win, preside over Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to stand in the next general election as head of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the general election, became Chairman of Congress.
This was announced at the press conference by PSOE Secretary for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, following a meeting with Zapatero, which took place today at noon at the party's federal headquarters.
The executive chief justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be a Socialist Party candidate for the President of Congress if the Socialists win in the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as Chairman of Congress, who published his decision not to run in the next general election on November 15, leaving his active political career to pursue the fight against climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly urged him to return to the top politics he had left two years ago.
He also stated that just as citizens know who will be Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, if PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will chair Congress.
If Bono acquires this function, he hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not a swearing or screaming" and to make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where it is impossible to speak in peace and quiet is Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate, on one occasion, has been interrupted 26 times".
Likewise, he spoke commendable words to the current chairman Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not yet want to imagine himself in his place, so as not to lower himself to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate propaganda
As the movement against climate change undergoes ruthless persecution, both for those who view its predictions sceptically and for those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must demonstrate firm cohesion.
Moreover, to have a movement leader who is Prime Minister as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why the action or inaction of his government has made a significant contribution to Spain's failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening, and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take in order to slow climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays to save the planet.
But we didn't get any of those explanations, nor do we get them.
It's because we have to sacrifice ourselves and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centimetre from the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky for Zapatero in terms of elections that he rushed to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it doesn't cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the treaties with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks, blames, asks for nothing, but is an adornment of meetings and stirs up tenderness.
If it is limited to being a virtual contracting party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totany arrested on suspicion of corruption practices during construction
As the investigative sources were informed, the Civilian Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, the "people's" of José Martínez Andrea, the chief of local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in hospitality, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and taken to the city hall, in whose premises he is now located along with a number of police officers, who also came to the Construction Commission and the City Enterprise for Industrial Lands and Housing Management.
These three arrests were added to the six that occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving the retraining of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last term, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged in abbreviated proceedings in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
Six of the first arrested were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency, registered today in Totana, and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area, was charged.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigran (the Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which bribes were passed.
The investigation is carried out by a crime group under the construction of the Civilian Guard Operations Central Unit, whose members, in addition to arrest, also conducted eleven searches, mostly in firms related to the arrested, headquartered in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (the provinces of Madrid) and Totana.
At the time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, in the area of the very well known owner of the poultry products company, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcian town of Totana, which would represent the construction of over 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "sleeping".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the settlement of the municipality, which has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Corunya, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
That's what happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's release of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18, on the same day that the critic of Blackburn's book coincided:
"The content of the course of philosophy penetrated public discussions in connection with tragedy at a school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, an education councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical position on Plato and claimed that there was no need to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory basic course of philosophy at secondary schools."

One colleague informs on the introduction of the criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime with rates ranging from six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you dispose of records in the store worth less than EUR 400, it is considered a mere misdemeanor (§ 623.1).
B. estrangement in a store of up to €1,000 is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (§ 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in shifts of compacts.
Attendance of disorderly conduct has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and the rate from six months to two years would be the rate from six months to the exchange of compacts
(§ 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is more punished than the provision of pornographic materials to juveniles (§ 186).
So if my colleague's right, someone's arm is missing, and it's gone.

My attending physician is pushing one of his articles on strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or, the feelings that a month’s salary causes for employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at Bonn University using magnetic resonance imaging on the tomography and results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the group Displaying the neurocognition of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague misrepresented."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, activation was mild, but when one got double, activation was higher.
I really don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
Applicant for the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been fiercely persecuted by the state prosecutor of the Court of Justice in The Hague by criminals from the Balkan War.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims perished, former General Ratko Mladič and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzič, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which he took over the title of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not listed in Spain), which, at the pace of the detective thriller, follows from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss applicant in pursuit of escaped criminals and pressure on the respective states to pull the net.
What kind of insurance is appropriate for me?
The insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident is a substantial expenditure that depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, duration of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to choose a suitable car insurance than to choose a model of the car.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insurance amount of a certain amount for taking care of the damage in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined with respect to various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the likelihood of a crash, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons over 25 years of age and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that married persons have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the rides and thus the probability of having an accident.
The growth in the frequency of rides increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of insurance premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the kind of insurance that best fits his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for the selection of one or the same type of insurance, which, in addition to complying with the type of insured person, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 encounter various disadvantages such as the lack of driving experience and the short possession of a driving licence when they want to negotiate insurance premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good cover, there are also cheaper variants.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount in premiums so as to obtain insurance cover for all risks, but at a more acceptable price.
This type of contract would assume the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"Part of the payment of the insurance event provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the premium, which will be even higher, how much less co-participation would be", explains Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe in Spain, an intermediary of insurance over the Internet.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants by insureing the client against damage caused by other persons, but not against damage on his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire, and vehicle loss.
Recommendations.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction of the basic rate that an insurance company has.
By contrast, malus is an increase in the said basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to raise the bonus", Noguera explains.
After crossing the 25-year limit, drivers have it easier when they go to arrange insurance, as the client's risk index decreases, thanks to their acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of pre-established experience when a crash occurs, nor when driving", assures the director of European society in Spain and adds that most accidents occur in the second year of proceedings, when the 'fear of a newcomer' has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount (which could be EUR 300) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other users, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is calmer and their purchasing capacity higher, so they can afford luxury to get the highest discount", observes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended to cover all risks with a discount of premiums (which is EUR 150) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expenditure, which is a good reason for appropriate examination of the insurance options that would suit us most in view of our personal situation.
Celtic tries to get at AC Milan point which means eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to gain a point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the conclusion of the League's "Champions", as for the Italians it would mean being the first and for the Scots it would decide the location.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured progress in the fifth match by a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs one more to make sure that Chechťor does not get in front of him with six points playing with Benfika, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where it first takes the thirteenth in the semifinals, in an attempt to advance to the finals being played on the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive result at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to compete for victory because the Italians will not want to tactize on home ground and Celtic knows that after winning he would be the first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
Gordon Strachan's men could even have lost if Chechťor didn't win, but he can't count on it because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) advanced, but won in the first straight game (2:0).
Thus, the AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening to the Scots who believe that they will get into the semifinals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League just as they defeated them in the same match in the last challenge by goal Kaka in overtime (1:0) after a state of 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hoping to win the "rossoneri" will be the Chechťor for whom it is worth winning, only if Celtic loses, both for advance to the eight-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being the last and having no chance to continue the highest European competition, could achieve third place by one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
20,000 people participated in the first concert in the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls group started its first tour in Vancouver (Canada) ahead of 20,000 viewers since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before opening their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver stated that the reconnection of their group was "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present for the concert, which also included a video that recounts the history of this group, which triggered a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as they are released by a new album released by EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets, which were donated to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, despite Victoria's nervous ban on it a few days ago.
Prior to the start of the performance, Victoria Beckham stated about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks of the performance".
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the contradictions between us" caused the dissolution of a five-member group two years later, also revealed her nervousness in meeting journalists two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, that the opinion of Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I decided", Chisholm told me about the reconnection of the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things settled and we all loved each other very much".
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver with a Virginia Airlines special.
An army of nannies was expecting them on arrival at the airport.
The five have a total of 7 children.
After a concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), in San José (4 December) and in Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He will perform in Madrid on 23 December.
Fears of a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the prices of natural gas, and so the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected is increasing.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is conducted through pipelines across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raised the prices of gas to Ukraine, Russia would charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more because he agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas he receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during negotiations," said Reuters Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoli Kinach to the Agency.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees (to Western Europe) via Ukraine."
The last larger dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a drop in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused an overwhelming fall in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of them remain under-used.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The controller said that the Scottish NHS Chamber must improve criminal register controls for non-European employees.
A recommendation from President of Robert Black's Supreme Audit Office came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreign personnel it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were conducted in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was immediately interested in personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area following the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge charged with connection to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the UK before his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
A report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines that help employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found out that part of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," she announced.
Mr Black said that Scottish NHS is in many ways in line with its own pre-employee vetting policy, but also added: "Our report draws attention to areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the amount of foreign personnel."
President of BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employee controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employee controls in Scottish NHS work well and it is unclear what further value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1 161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably be higher also because the commissions had difficulty identifying personnel with residence permits.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revamping the policies and directives of pre-employee controls for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to handle this job immediately after a terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices appear in the updated directives of pre-employee controls of all personnel - including foreign personnel - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division took over the film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for the best film.
The awards were also won by star Sam Riley, who worked until the role of Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbibin and in the side role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress behind the thriller Journal of the scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The prizes were ceremonially handed over at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' path to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie, and New Order - cost only £3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the album U2 Joshua Tree, two awards - for the best director and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning one - as Julien Temple's film about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen was awarded a plaque for the best actor as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in London's thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard men, won the Richard Harris Award for an extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This 50 - year - old, whose films include, for example, Scum, Nil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, which is named after the star of Camelot films and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He is my man, the great actor of his day, I am very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers sit.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loch, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people over a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants due to membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities, as well as on spiritual and security forces.
State television reported to the largest oil exporter that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers campaigned against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since 2003, i.e. since the invasion of Iraq.
The television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a stranger planned an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid response unit of 35,000 members to defend the facility from the failed al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report cited the Ministry's internal statement: 18 arrested belonged to a cell led by "a rocket launcher" that slipped into the country.
She further stated that the militants were planning to smuggle eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged clergymen to try harder to prevent the Saudis from leaving for Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and the Shia government supported by the US, whom conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities co-opted many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to support the royal families that control the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of al-Qaeda leader Saudia Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings, and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," said the state television internal spokesman for the ministry.
Also arrested was a 16-member "media cell" in Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfirian thought" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims designated as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate of Venus may be a glimpse of the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could have once been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more similar to the headstrong twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the recovered greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and lower rate of rotation sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and be ravaged by storms and hurricane winds.
Findings from the probe of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a moderate view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford Physics Department and one of Venus Express' mission leaders said, "It is becoming more and more clear why the climate in Venus is so different than on Earth, although the planets themselves are otherwise quite alike.
"Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus began as well as Earth, perhaps even with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police have intercepted "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched with uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesperson stated that three people were detained and the material is being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
♪ Still wide open ♪
Mitt Romney said that it is not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over for broadcast to candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28 was as comic as a snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the second party's debate on YouTube.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected much about the state of the Republican Party toward the elections next year.
It is unclear exactly how CNN producers, one of the debate sponsors, selected clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked the undecided electorate panel to turn the disc when they heard something pleasing: the announcer noted the peaks of consent when candidates talked about hard access at the border.
The hardest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who poked ahead in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake down the reputation of a man who, as Mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing former Massachusetts State governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
These two wrestled particularly fiercely when the interviewers asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (give illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Side candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, Colorado Congressman, managed to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of these two have a chance of a nomination, but both remain in the game for perhaps starting to sound the alarm for immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have roughly the same opinion: greater rigour at borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between the Libertines and Christian Conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether a simulated heater technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through it to the point that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all the assumptions in the recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning a laugh.
The duel remains extremely open.
Mr Huckabee's increase in Iowa is covered with recent achievements in raising money and loud cheers by Ron Paul in Wednesday's debate.
These two rebounded from the bottom, as the two wings of the party still cannot agree on more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning news of American greatness on its lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown again found a trap into which he might fall; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
No orders appear to have been sold, no accounts at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would do without discovering that some wealthy businessman for four years had masked the contributions to the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under other people's names, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling the election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by polls, there was a hope that it would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being worded by an increasingly witty representative of the Liberal Democrats, the once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of the Troubled Bank of Northern Rock showed weaknesses in driving and poor judgment under fire.
The poorly-thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative failure.
A trio of retired generals launched a rebellion in the House of Lords; they objected to cuts in military spending, claiming that being a commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of Labour (and their former internal discipline guard), has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is irrefutable towards his end.
In spite of this, governments can reach the point of tipping beyond which they find the governments heavy.
The people don't trust politicians and they don't like them, but they usually push their distrust away when the new crew takes over.
When it seems clear that a Prime Minister is probably not going to improve anything, and he may not be in office for long, this is a push away: the state administration is becoming leaky, ministers start making briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
Mr Brown's position is particularly complex in one direction, because he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the Treasury records are linked to the decisions that Mr Brown made as Finance Minister.
And although he was not directly involved in Blair's troubles, such as a long investigation into the funding of political parties caused by "values for money", voters may well conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they look.
Those missteps aren't as terrible as conservatives make them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been completely deceived.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The latest commotion about political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, says he wanted no publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't his.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who might buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams' advance, but did not know it was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly questioned; as did Jon Mendelsohn, the chief Labour money hunter who learned of tricky donations in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, although the main part of the payments took place only after his onset in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but dilute his determination by reaching out for a proven instrument, a commission for examining this matter - also led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, lessons are not difficult.
If the law has been broken, this is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and advancing with a real reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require Labour, who are in close proximity to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the union - bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to win is unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the US credit card market affect the sub-prime crisis?
When blood is in the water, naturally, dorsal fins begin to wave around excitedly.
Now that the U.S. property market is wasting away, predators are targeting the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if sub-prime mortgages infected other consumer loan variants.
The signs of tension are obvious.
The number of defaults (in more than 30 days of payment delay) and debited accounts (accounts considered by the provider to be unenforceable) is increasing.
HSBC announced last month that it lost $1.4 billion on the US consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it is still too early for panic.
There are still few written-off accounts and inability to pay back.
According to the Moody's evaluation agency, the 3.89% insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below average.
The worsening rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Act 2005 resulted in a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies that make much of the credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore rise, regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers worsened.
The sector also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts per month.
And trust in credit card security is solid, despite paralysis in other parts of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup's research firm predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% larger than last year.
Direct routes for spreading infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when real estate property loans are drying out, consumers tend to owe themselves over credit cards.
Credit card publishers, however, view the cash flow rather than the value of the voucher items, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They may even be advantageous for loan providers.
Consumer motivation to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; consequently, credit on cards shifts up to the list of priorities for repayment.
Card publishers can also respond faster and more flexibly to turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid price change of the guarantors.
"It doesn't happen that one beautiful morning we'll just reevaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the form of sub-prime mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case
The three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud associated with former financial leader of the Enron Group Andrew Fastow changed their statements on Wednesday and plead guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew originally blamed seven fraud charges, where they were to participate in financial fraud together with Fastow in 2000 -- to enrich themselves in the account of their employers -- denied.
They were supposed to stand trial in January.
However, during a trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former Greenwich NatWest executives, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was featured on the front pages throughout the two years that the extradition process lasted.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation initiated after the Enron crash in 2001.
The accusations raised against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The prosecution against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims to have come to Houston in 2000 to con a scam along with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner branch controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of many Enron frauds that pushed Enron in a spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its share in this branch by zero, but our three British people knew it was actually worth a lot.
The company under Kopper's control bought a share of the bank in this $1 million branch.
Incriminated bankers paid the Koppers $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the impeachment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But the 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow, and others.
According to the indictment, the bankers received $7.3 million, and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in three years and one month's sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three British were free on bail of $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse abolished thousands of jobs, over $60 billion of market value, and over $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron's founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of their roles in the fall of society last year.
Skilling is in charge of more than 24 years' sentence.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow Non-Powerless
The Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine, and with enough fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream Representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many jobs because it's for a narrow family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire's show, which is a four-day orgy of flamboyant consumption at the mammoth exhibition center on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers have built their stalls, hoping that the newly rich Russians would lure everything from mahogany-soldering yachts to diamonds decorated with car counters that would not be ashamed of even 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer carefully looked for a bright orange Porsche in the next stall.
"That's a nice car, but against us it's pennies and dimes," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market".
Oil waves are pouring money into the Russian capital just like when Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans became enormously rich and went to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at Davis Center of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like Saudi spreaders from the 1970s and Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians become the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Klondika.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH Group to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of wealthiest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total worth of $282 billion.
Moreover, the local main institute in Center for Economic and Financial Research issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, whose assets totalling $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London Jewellery David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly groomed and men are all worth a fortune."
As they walked in the evening dress on Sunday night through the halls, 21 - year - old Evgenia Yumatova and five years older Svetlana Turovcova identified themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who was covering herself in designer clothing as a red carpet veteran, who makes Joan Rivers look like a homemade chick.
The fair seemed to focus mainly on fresh rich people, brand-controlled Russian buyers, who are willing to sit in the road for several hours to walk around the warehouse, which loudly mixes Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, pool tables, apartments in Dubai, Gund plushs and draughts.
Members of the common public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr.Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproduction of Rembrandt's image from hand-painted blue tile oversized.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the glitter."
Indeed, the local vendors say that the Russians with old money (according to Russian standards is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from flashing logos to few known labels limited by editions that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires, or simple tourists, flooded the fair hall every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local bed manager general of King Koil, stated that he sold two matrac sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold threads, after $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, told the high-end cars by high-end alarms that his firm sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, stated on request that he had sold three bars to cars in the style of linked chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms after $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a fabric coated with Swarovsky crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconia, doesn't have to ride those wheels yet," said Mr Karapetian.
"He puts them in his garage of 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently means nothing very exclusive, given the large increase in prices of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at a stand operated by the Russian Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company erected four red phone booths of British style stuffed column of counterfeit bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires Fair.
The passers-by stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to let friends take pictures with a cell phone, as they rest in the middle of a spare fortune, or simply stuffed a pocket of a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey possibly caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the big windows of the local restaurant a little healthier and followed an ambulance that arrived at the white New England house by two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car soon joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw a medical examiner's van arrive," said Mr Livingston, restaurant supervisor.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the New York Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and hope that toxicology tests, whose results may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief to the Newwar police.
Miss Arroy was an assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known by many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and worked hard," McCarthy said about Miss Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, State's Attorney for Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Miss Arroy died from the consequences of an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. 21.
On November, they found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is reportedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities interviewed Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday in Miss Castro's house, with a broken pink bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel in the open garage, marked "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Miss Arroy provided him with invaluable help in biting through the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this one or this one," he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to a strengthening of the world stock exchange
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market's hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm the lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernank, the Fed's chairman, said that in responding to continued pressure on the financial markets, executives must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In a clear attempt to calm down irritable markets amid signs of rising credit effort, Mr Kohn said that recent excitement "particularly reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets towards the end of September and October".
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of further worsening of the financial conditions of households and firms would increase.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is prepared to deliver additional fresh capital injections to US markets, and possibly further cuts in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of other bad news about the American economy when the sale of flats in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of financial vortex were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns by the investment bank that it would abolish 650 jobs, which is 4% of its world workforce, in the context of reducing costs due to the compensation of heavy losses caused by a failed bet on the provision of sub-standard housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York City, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 index strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index strengthened by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by over £39 billion.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 strengthened by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets proved to be in full force after three-month European Central Bank cash packages auctioned, these funds were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release above-standard money on London's money markets has increased, with rates of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" rising after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to its maximum since late September - 6.59%.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who will be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the committee selector, who holds on to this post at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision-making help and because Hugh Morris, the chief manager of the English team, begins to fulfill applications for the post national selector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
He who will not be built in sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, selection is challenging and requires an assessment that must always be subjective in the end.
Is this the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same question in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and insight in the field, should be promoted to the commission - the place is only for one.
Who's to say which level is right for cricketers if he doesn't get a chance to drop or swim on the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a great influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
The team's cricketer must at the right moment capture the captain's view of whether to take a Wicket, and the batsman needs regular chances at starting positions, if he ever has to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
It's more complicated to capture the collector's view.
For example, last season there were many better ones, which James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artillery.
Anderson took 32 pickets in first class at 33 times each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same meagre average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish both careers, or it may not have a great influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka he played Gareth Batty in every Test and in first grade he served good performances, five Wickets and 40 vacation runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time fought for his place who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who is extra, although in Australia he scored twice a hundred points, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training cleanly at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful luxuries.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah speaking his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first grade compared to the six Bopars, who are, at 22 years of age, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah did in two innings in May against the Caribbean at the Lord's Test, his home field in Middlesex, just ten defectors, along with the immediate rejection of the selectors, when Vaughan wanted to retake him for the next match, his batting seemed to take away something of the vigor that was so evident in Mumbai.
In contrast, the Essex Universal has a joie de vivre in its bones.
On the cricket field, nothing frightens him, and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently flipped car with four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of an English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and probably shock, but first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate who watched it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed skid pitches on the local playgrounds that seem to suit him, gives out effectively and batting confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah will not excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and pouring out refugees who ran out of money or visa periods, and others hoping that the city would return to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight the militants who have driven them out of their homes.
Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubajsi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the paper, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, having in mind the Shia militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to interrupt the fight.
Kasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amarija, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amaria called him saying that the local militia, with the support of the U.S. Army, helped push al-Qaeda out of her positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shia tribe, which from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad drove out a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, a few friends called me and told me that they were starting a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said 26-year-old Sabaah Al Obeidi.
Many have spoken of the attraction of calming in the capital after strengthening the American military presence and growth of local "groups of biased citizens", which, with a gun in hand alongside the U.S. military, defend their neighborhoods.
But more talked about being forced to return by visa obstruction and money loss in Damascus, to which more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three children, voiced out loud suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and thus induce them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
A partial reason for weakening violence is the fact that the Sunni were pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
Fears arise that the sudden influx of refugees will once again stir up sectarian tensions and lead to further struggle.
Little Saarland, good education
The smallest Federal State of Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even the international focus of its universities.
Only in one educational area is Saarland concerned by the same lack as the rest of Germany.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time that we were not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarsk on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest Federal country.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in fifth place.
Thus, colleges traditionally cooperate closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students may terminate their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above average number of children in Sara is admitted to college - many of them without studying at the gymnasium.
"In Sársko, the vocational education system is being used", says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert of IW.
By getting more than one in five minors permission to study at a vocational school, Sársko is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich possibilities in Sársko to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two disciplines are the second best in Germany with regard to the population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Syria has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we carried out several reforms in general education schools," says the spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
For children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge - a model taken over by other Länder.
If the results of pupils improve significantly, they will show future comparative studies.
In carrying out the 2003 Pisa study, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 %.
In total, however, Sársko did not improve as much as other Länder did.
The bosses can do better than that.
And to the disappointment of the Sárska study, Pisa does not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sársko could be scoring in this area.
The language of neighbors is compulsory at grammar schools - although the inhabitants of Sársko are not French.
Chávez shifts clocks
Soon the clock in Venezuela will go differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will have the hours in this South American country moved back half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela's official newspaper reported that the clock would shift by minus four and a half hours according to the new law compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the US, justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the world to split time zones throughout the hours.
In addition, in the middle of local time, Chávez announced that, due to a hostage case, he was interrupting relations with neighboring Colombia.
This left-wing nationalist stated that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe was President of Colombia, he would not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can no longer do so because of my self-respect," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution on which the citizens of this oil country must vote in the Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would have greatly strengthened his power in the country.
The argument prompted Uribe's decision to remove Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels to release hostages.
Uribe criticized Uribe in the face with his decision to "spit in Venezuela", criticizing Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
Also in Spain, everyone is talking about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone here caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" - that's a sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was voiced by Spanish King Juan Carlos, whom at the recent ibero-American summit, loud remarks from this left-wing populist upset him so much that he silenced him in this way.
The Germans are facing lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages this year despite a strong boom.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to Hans Böckler's estimates, in 2007, employed people can realistically count on getting a lower wage than last year.
"The guilt carries a small salary increase, a value added tax increase, and a price increase for food and energy," said Bild Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance minister Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% was correct and reasonable in this situation as of the new year.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties to require loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, citing the newspaper of this social democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was published that the price explosion of food and oil products drove out inflation on its highest level over the last thirteen years.
Overall, prices increased by three percent in the annual comparison.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth
Despite its life's hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar to what was supposed to be. Venus Express's European spacecraft on Venus recorded phenomena that appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind belief at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is being flashed.
Now the European Venus Express probe brought evidence - it captured electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at about 56 kilometers high, wrote in the science magazine Nature Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the formation of the primary matter, life could have originated on Earth through lightning, and storms reportedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
That was not the case with Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, something living could hardly be found on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about 100 times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Venushe may be the Earth's infernal twin, but it's a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to the Earth with matter and size, began to evolve completely differently, is the basic issue of the Ace mission.
As no probe has been sent exclusively to study Venus since the early 1990s, the start of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in research into this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results that approached several articles of Nature magazine did not just emphasize Venus’s uniqueness in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more similar to the Earth than anticipated to date," Ace said.
In addition to the already known wind vortex at the North Pole, scientists found a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which revolves considerably faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air currents on the Earth's northern hemisphere, writing a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of the Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km it is almost the same size.
This planet, referred to as Morning or Evening, orbits the Sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns much slower around its own axis, one day on Venus, it lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble the Earth with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bars, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
But on Earth, it remained in the oceans while Venus evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's encounter with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands the end of party disputes due to the Dalai Lama's acceptance at the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls on the great coalition to end the feud about the Dalai Lama's acceptance.
"We should not present ourselves on the outside as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt's economic newspaper.
At the same time, he expressed understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
Although the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent him from standing up for Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not dropped the traditional policy of single China.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disapproval of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition because of this.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "pretentious" foreign policy of the coalition.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery Office, German-Chinese relations worsened.
Not only did the Chinese government lift the invitation of German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the acceptance of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao emphasized China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located in China, is attempting to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France
Street fights with police, gunfights, torched cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from becoming violent on the street, calling on the Federal Minister for the Interior.
The barricades were on fire, the rioters shot shotguns at the police. After serious youth unrest in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create such social tensions in our country, which will erupt in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said in the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not all youths are said to be able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The Federal Government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to solve problems, Schäuble said.
Which doesn't just mean migrant integration.
"From the Summit on Integration to the Conference on Islam, we record first achievements".
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In the past night, juveniles have fought hard street fighting with police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "implication effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is "over-average".
Above all, there is a need to ensure a greater number of learning opportunities.
Kolat emphasized, "We must give youthful hope."
However, the President of the Turkish municipality added that, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "We still have to pay attention."
We need to allow juveniles "to start working quickly and to learn."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly calm.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and helicopters flew over the area with headlights.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several heated trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces have been taking care of the peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, after visiting the suburbs, Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie announced.
In riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse riots seized.
Disorders triggered a Sunday traffic accident in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the state's attorney, the police are not to blame for the death of teenagers.
In the kingdom of Angela, "The Clouds"
The Chancellor's reality's remote output documents that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can't expect anything more from it either.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferently sounding and content-poor speech at the General Debate of the Federal Assembly, we must state: not here - not in this country, which, after all, she should manage.
To blame for focusing too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel responded with one very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what critics are up to.
In the Federal Assembly, she visibly showed everyone how much she deserved the reproach.
Merkel was not even really interested, let alone a sense of trouble in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" presented herself: a politician who excels over others who flees into foreign policy and even there is only vaguely expressed.
For example, climate protection: constant praise is given for the conclusions resulting from the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And anyway, such self-praising - so much impropriety the CDU chairman would have forgiven herself two years ago.
It is now limited to idle phrases that might increase its popularity among people.
This approach harms its imij pragmatists, who do not need to flatter because they solve problems.
But in the Angela Empire, "The Clouds", internal political problems are marginal issues.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
She's got a few minor sentences left on the subject.
It is worth noting how often the Merkels misinterpret themselves when it comes to child support.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning in order to be able to say at least in part the right sentence.
Once things get too specific, they stumble like they're in completely foreign terrain.
Attack Department
The debate of Republican presidential candidates for Youtube has been heated up in heated debate for the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to worry about the outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is reflected on the first topic.
Mitt Romney pitches to his rival Rudy Guiliani that he has made New York "a refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp regrets: "I believe that his own house was just one such refuge," he replies and pitches to former governor Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrants without papers.
As the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates use these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, internet users filmed and over Youtube sent videos serve only as such help key theme.
"We have allowed Hitler to seize power with such a policy of isolationism," John McCain pitches to his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain spares neither Romney nor his regrets, for refusing to condemn the agonizing interrogation method called "Waterboarding", in which heating is simulated.
Audience reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither war in Iraq nor methods of torture are among the important themes of the campaign.
The audience bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This shows where the weakness of both favorites lies.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains condescendingly and asks the party base and television audience for forgiveness for being a proponent of abortions in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first reigns in civil
The day after his resignation from the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took a presidential oath.
That concludes eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan President Parvíz Musharraf took a presidential oath on Thursday, thus remaining in the presidential office for the next five years.
Pakistan television carried a live ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed his office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the U.S. side.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning from the position of Chief Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional condition declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyuma, Musharraf will cancel the state of emergency soon after his oath, thus fulfilling another of the demands of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, following the announcement of an emergency state at the beginning of November, occupied his inclined lawyers, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed while attacking a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal area and four others were injured.
An Army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
Fathers of the Krautrock Return
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group took up their electronic synthesizers at the concert in Berlin again.
Revival will include Live 1974, a haircut from the band's most successful period.
They were already significantly better known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three settled gentlemen who initially look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everybody's got a box, cables and buttons in front of them.
63-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
On his left is a fifty-seven-year-old Michael Rother who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who bows intently over synthesizers, is from the viewer's point of view to the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes beats.
Sometimes, inadvertently, they become a traditional track.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians much.
Among Krautrock lovers, Harmonia's revival caused a considerable stir.
The repeated questions have shown that this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not long enough to miss the band for twenty-three years.
But why can't even a German celebrate his still-living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when they value the musical style, mistakenly called Krautrock, in England and America more than in their own country.
When the music business awarded the Echo Award to surviving members of the Can Group of Cologne for a Life Work in 2003, the hall was full of enquiring views of German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the La Düsseldorf and Neu! groups in their speech, the audience's wonder no longer knew the border.
Michael Rother later at Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia we unnecessarily overloaded memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time did not have such an influence as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially they played in the basement of Berlin's Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a gramophone company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the band Cluster's musicians to exile in Forst, Westerbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, a ruins of the 16th century, they lived as members of a commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to grope like a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the given art is reportedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing choir, whose badge is reported to have been found in the trash can.
Many of it was kept by Harmony.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the following was called "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting roosts did not just serve self-knowledge.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been edited in front of a record-breaking small, barely fifty-membered set during the Griess concert.
At the time, Rothera expressed a wish for Harmony members to exorcise and practice occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebius, that was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in an esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
Cluster's band came back to life in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His record firm Grönland took the goal of Krautrock to cherish as an original German contribution to live music.
The Neu! band was considered by Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance of the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be British, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the Krautrock Sampler handbook.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
Thus we outlined the overall extent of impact of the Krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled in by Harmonia.
Brian En's sentence accompanied by the strangest sounds hovers in the hall: "The only true music, it owns the future."
There are paintings on which a producer with Harmonia is in a peasant seat.
Other black-and-white photographs, on which a set of apparatus is wildly connected by cables, also contribute to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are once again busy with improvisation.
Not by gluing microphones onto organ and drums to pull out the instruments of the never-heard self-made tones.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of immersing punts.
Even the congregation of the House of World Cultures does not change that.
Under Barbara Morgenstern, there's a whisper under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place, there's an emphatically sung "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Roots would be found rather than in blues at music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not be brought out of peace even now.
Even the most obvious part of the scene is thought carefully.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question will either rob a person of his nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
With The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the Balkan War appeared.
But neither of them is convincing.
The draft of films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop that at The Hunting Party.
Good news first: The war criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the bleak background of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he has played in many pleasing, unscrupulous roles in cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences on Buddhism forever, they take one's appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become prey (Why must movie names be so long and tangled nowadays?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could become if fate and film industry were not so merciful: a man who has long since had his best years, but still retains a remarkable charm as a ruin like this.
But despite this trump is The Hunting Party along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinemas this week, just a sequel to an endless series of unsuccessful films about the Balkan War.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can do a brief process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, then one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this televised plentiful film changes too soon into shooting and action.
The film will leave something very similar to the Kobru 11 series, without the highway, but for the war.
On the film The Hunting Party, you can explore why so far the Balkan War has failed to make a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters posing as "the fox", a Serbian chief war criminal, would at another time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (here is both Richard Shepard) possibly become the new "Apocalypse".
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauchery and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft also prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
We can finally write off The Hunting Party after reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film succeed in what NATO, the CIA and all the criminal hunters of the world have failed in the last five years: catching criminals and leaving it just revenge for Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court in The Hague.
In doing so, this film has a profoundly human message.
It condemns that Karadzić and Mladić are still at large, and suspects Americans and French (here they are exceptionally united) that, under secret political agreements, they do not engage in persecution intensively.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar, women will think of the famous Brecht poem.
There is a wooden mask of Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, remarking: how hard it is to be evil."
In films like The Hunting Party, they perform exactly such swollen heads, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
To this one can be added: No good film has ever been made about South Africa.
Almost always true: When a star hangs around a crisis area or walks around a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Boundary of Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio will be created.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, they had to go decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler List.
Many films must probably mature - films that are today considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter", "The Apocalypse" or "The Lead vest" - were not in any way celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today, when every mass murder comes home right away on two screens, we know too much about this world's conflicts.
Writers then do not have the ability that is needed to tell good stories flawlessly.
"Being or not" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime actually ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to create a sarcastically distant artistic view as novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked for parallels between his historical novel "Lemprièr's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War," he stated: "The image lies only in that some things never change.
Large cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered and there will also always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for the Olympiad's disclaimer
The mayor's resignation from holding the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg came upon fierce criticism of politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, urges realism in estimating chances.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called this decision "in terms of business, unhappy".
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sportfully political enthusiasm to such a high extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on an altered timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his earlier statements, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on Olympic candidacy", told von Beust to the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that in early December the Sports Union would decide on Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means for us that we have no realistic chance with the timetable of 2028."
Yet this dream is not over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beust's statements regrettable.
It gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to compete for the organisation of the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is still too soon to destroy our chances by marking the plans as buried at this early stage," said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
The waiver would be contrary to the Senate chief's statement made at the General Assembly of the General German Higher Sports Union.
Von Beust did not report Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 University as a replacement for the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg College Sports Association has only nominated for a candidate city in the past week.
The faction of the SPD in the Hamburg Senate Parliament has accused the Senate of wasting valuable time that could be used to build flats in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because he bet on organizing the Olympics and excluded the construction of flats," SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area still planned the Olympics with the entire area being later used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
Running for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm at its time in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, crashed on Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever combines the terms of Sweden and wooden crates is not thinking of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Do you?
Wooden crates produced currently in Sweden cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of his listed ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type are falsified.
After Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of the 1968 Warhol's "Brillo Boxes", comes internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm with the result that brought disillusionment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Museum of Moderna Museet donated to its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - as are most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type, which are on the international art market in circulation.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, painted wooden crates that were based on the red-blue-white design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works in Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It was not works of art, but of their designs, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo crates in Sweden, but those in Moderna Museet are not displayed.
At the time, witnesses now speak of fifteen crates that rightly entered artistic and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol Brillo Boxy" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the legendary director of Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 approximately a hundred crates were manufactured and displayed, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were made in Malmö for an exhibition in Saint Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief conservator of Moderna Museet, explored in addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood plates were painted with basic paint and brushed with oil white paint.
On the contrary, the 1990 copy structure revealed that the paint was applied without the previous basic coating directly to the plywood plate - in addition it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official charter Brillo Boxes," said Modern Museet's director, Lars Nittve: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six crates of his exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "ministerial accusations" that were raised in the matter of boxes with soap powder.
But the organization still remains in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered who fortified in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagoal Arroy.
The rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with the use of tear gas.
About two dozen soldiers had fortified in the building hours before.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial due to a botched coup attempt in 2003, including the Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his about 30 sympathizers.
Apparently, military police officers who were supposed to watch over him defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government's loyal troops have closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite unit Scout Rangers said that other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for large demonstrations to take place against the president on Friday.
For months now, corruption has been blamed on her government.
The Manila financial area became the main scene of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo in 2003.
As the army refused to join the insurgents, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven times in the Philippines, they have tried to overthrow the democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes Versatel's majority shareholder
United Internet has secured more than a 20% stake in Versatel’s telecommunications business.
On Wednesday, the company announced that the average price per share was EUR 14.46.
It is said that the company now owns 20.05 % of the share capital.
Before that, there was speculation about taking over.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market with this step.
Following the increase of its stake in the company of this Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5 % to 15,1 %, there were doubts of entry on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this money institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had almost 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put an additional 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million for sale.
Of which, 5.15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We strengthen our partnership," United Internet spokesman explained.
In order to take over the competing company Freenet, the companies combined established the SME Joint Undertaking.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies will be satisfied in Freenet with a share of more than 10% and will not use their right to take over an additional 18.49% of this company.
It is considered that the companies have kept all options open so far, especially the possibility of further increasing their participation in Freenet AG.
Interviews between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This already months-long and hard-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile network contract customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connections.
Holding United Internet and Drillische still held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will receive approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49 % of the investment company Vatas was agreed as early as August.
