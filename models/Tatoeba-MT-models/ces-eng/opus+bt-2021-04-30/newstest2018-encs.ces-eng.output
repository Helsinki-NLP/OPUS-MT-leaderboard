The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advantage of Color People (NAACP) published a warning for color people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the state's discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
"NAACP travel recommendations for the state of Missouri, effective as of 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when travelling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state," the Association's statement states.
The NAACP stated that this action was taken under the current laws of the state of Missouri, which make it difficult to defend racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as as the actions of law enforcement authorities that disproportionately target minorities.
‘There are violations of civil rights.
People are being stopped by policemen just because of the color of their skin, are being attacked or killed," said the Kansas City Star president of the NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We still have the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated insults directed against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of blackness from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and was thrown into custody by the police without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri State Attorney General, stating that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should carry money for any bail payment or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by the state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI program to report hate crimes, there were a hundred cases of hate behavior in Missouri in 2015, which places the state at sixteenth place among all states.
The travel warning is also the answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue the company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration bill allowing state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which according to ACLU is to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for Foreign Countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family hasn't had peace in 12 years!
Murdered is Sally Anne Bowman's model.
A girl native of Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixi directly at the restaurant she worked in, who placed stab wounds on her.
Both the victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched a thorough crime scene inspection work.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to imprisonment in 2008 of 34 years for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a minor in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted the attention of a taxi driver," he claimed lyingly.
According to his statement, the girl was supposed to defend herself as much as she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After confessing to Dixie, he talked about his hornyness and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light his marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol, and taking cocaine, that's what Dexie himself said to the police.
He said he smelled adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people at large who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror mother of the late girl Linda revealed information about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither violent nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs Prague's Intimacy boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip around Moravia.
One of them not only brought a bike, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.
"Miscellaneous moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with a German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he operates the Intimity boutique in Prague's Benedict Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are commonly offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you talk about at lunch, you say?
Oh, come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin Fun Factory store, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It was opened in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how to handle Prague trade, where it should be and what it should be called.
Intimacy's name appealed to both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, after all, and it is also, you can say, gentle," he says.
It was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for an appropriate space, which went parallel to various interior visualizations.
In the end, the variant that spread the store into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, dominated by the bed, won.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem ideal because he wasn't on the main street, but because of it, he was sitting in the name of Intimacy again.
He's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so nobody's looking at customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And don't make them ashamed that they've ever entered a store like this.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to the sex store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even though there's only female service in the store, it doesn't mean that women aren't shy about asking for help, it doesn't mean a man's leg doesn't come here.
Most gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size and prefer bigger," Martin smiles over a frequent mistake.
It's the prejudices, the clichés, that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith might choose an unnecessaryly large vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black linen, whereas women tend to tend to be more pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
The expression on my face must make it clear that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's a sort of no-touch clitoral stimulator.
There's an adolescent need to laugh in me with admiration for the serious tone of interpretation.
It's like it's not eating.
And it doesn't actually stick.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's some kind of latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator shaped like a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe pairs.
He completely demolished the taboos that may persist in some men, seeing competition in erotic aids.
"Different variants are being made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with a remote control.
That's a favorite category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they may use them only externally.
In Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it'd have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin considers.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent." The most sale is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience during use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were very fond of erotic aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," he explained.
The mundane one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more connected to women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and vice versa, they are taboos for women." Just out of interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not violent.
On the contrary, we are quite an accommodating nation.
Certainly unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the shop ranges between 35 and 50 years old and "he already has a certain experience with both sex life and with some aids.
Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka will come for something nice, of a better quality to fill their partner's life with, or for themselves." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka care so much that they can see that it is perfectly functional for each product.
We also don't want to go into bondage and latex specials, because we don't have room for it either, and it's not really suitable here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are people who've always been shy of going to the sex shop because they were afraid something like that would come out of their eyes.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really nice.
It is also due to the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design prizes, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the mentioned sea horse "and this triggered a change in the entire sector.
It began to be abandoned from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-free, other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant to note that the Czech Republic is behind the design of some, namely popular designer Anna Marešová.
I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy those designer things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mareš, although they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who come straight for Venus' marbles from Anna Mareš.
She has done a really huge job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it is not a large production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may go a little upstream, but it seems important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years' time we will not be able to produce anything else," Anna later describes to me the situation that she and Martin agree that our company is becoming increasingly open.
He does not encounter a negative or negative attitude.
They say people are embarrassed at the most.
Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer, for which you can get a personal message, and this year she plans her own lubricant.
In the next year, vibrating eggs and other news should be added.
Healthy Sex Boundaries
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one of us may seem completely abnormal to another, so we're rather defining ourselves by a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them go into extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one final question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail came in asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural length of twenty-eight centimetres.
Well, we had to tell her we didn't have any of that.
The question is whether anyone was making fun of us," Martin measured me with a suspicious look.
Even that happens from time to time...
Shot for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štědrý is fighting a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend struggles with a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately it is true," the singer himself confirmed the sad information of Lightning.
I know about my illness, and so far, given the circumstances, I'm handling it quite well.
"I take medicines that have accompanying phenomena of disease to slow down," he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The entire branched family came together to facilitate Karl's life.
Eva's wife tries to stay home as much as she can, behind her father's house in White Mountain commutes daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Tereza, the son Karl said Karlas.
Generous twice fought cancer and passed his experience on to Slavík to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's had 60 chemo.
After them, he managed to return to work and to the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I have been told by the astrologer that I will be here by 90," said Charles to Lightning.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I won't forget them," Karel admitted.
Actress Kveta Purple is now fighting the same disease in the Institute.
Do you have a Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will assess the ÚS.
An absolute ban on abortion is still in force in Chile, so it must not be implemented for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing in parliament for more than two years," lamented Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and by the end of August it should be given a new chairman who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
The bill repealing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current president Michelle Bacheloret, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would attack the law in court because it would violate the right of an unborn child to live.
Members of the vote on the bill postponed last month until it was analyzed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, Members approved the proposal and did so again after them.
According to the new legislative regulation, abortion should cease to be criminal in three cases: if the life of a woman is at risk, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy has originated from rape.
Similar exceptions existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, in Chile since 1931, even before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion in 1989 introduced right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Others include Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years in prison for interrupting their pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, this was a spontaneous abortion that the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
The critique of the statue is an unmistakable sign of regime change.
Americans could tell about this as well as everyone else - see carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein at the Baghdad Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, surely knew what was coming when he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the topic of President's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigrants.
It's nice to say Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and impersonators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reprimanded Acosta by saying: “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem, which was placed additionally on the pedestal, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller's really right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
These are, above all, the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - not only invites them immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let me go, who goes down, who is poor, who can barely breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these "poor worms" on our screens.
Miller was not trying to criticise poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the meaning of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who, after her death, sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was intended to express the connection between the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The merging of a poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long tried to reverse that meaning.
Known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan Baptizer in the matter of Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not really invite anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: “The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It brings out a torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the trip to the United States."
Amazingly, Limbaugh is referring to something important.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the sight of an exhausted and damned passenger who often arrives after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean with hope in his heart to a new country.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championship 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish UK team members
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom's Athletic Federation, Neil Black, said that a strong squad of 16 Scots on the World Championship team would be "a huge asset to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the 2017 World Championships in London, starting on Friday.
Black believes that something strange is happening in Scotland, and British athletics could learn much from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand it and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
That's what people on the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“A few athletes, whether Scottish or other national athletes, came out of the room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
Passion and unhidden feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist of Commonwealth, who will compete in running over obstacles to 400 m at her fifth World Cup, stated that she was "unbelievable", that there are 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous 1983 and 2015 record is seven.
The middle-line runner, Muir, has set five British and two European records for the last year alone.
The MS will participate in a run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. This season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, at which she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The team's captain led her to be “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got on the team, but in many cases they will also attack participation in the finals and medals.
"The unusual thing about team captaining is that I was elected by other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by team members is all about it pleasing," she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves where we've moved to.
They're athletes who will think of the front seats on stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it's a good one.
I only pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew of his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take long to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he wasn't trying to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “Free speech may be taken away from us - and stupid and dumb will be led as sheep to slaughter. ”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union for these acts.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as for no reason, and there were many opinions in the comments on the Internet such as "who cares".
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, it does matter.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It can boast of the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not excruciating.
As can be seen, he manages his own state with certainty and strictly adheres to the principles.
He also turned out to be skillful in using Facebook as the main means of communication with his constituents - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a bare head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paid out of taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by blocking the comments from the position of moderating the posts.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers, or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people to whom contributions were deleted.
That is exactly what real people are - the real people who speak to their elected leaders; the teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As they all said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi's attorney Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the Washington Post Daily Comment section.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting so-called collective efforts instead of being recognised as a larger group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest" would probably have been called "defence".
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or delete negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for denigrating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces suit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born in Virginia last week.
According to District Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, where it prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook site.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the low shipping price had virtually the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press has quadrupled, and its position as leader has been questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belistarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions accumulating in his office criticizing his position on the Deal of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and intimidation lie within the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they are in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, they have more time to browse the web, and under the sunshade they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming, and a smartphone in your hand.
This is the typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This is based on O2’s fresh statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the flat rate than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum of our countrymen go during the winter, data consumption has increased even 50 times this summer season.
Italy then ranked second in the ranking of the data consumed.
Most minutes the Czechs will call from Germany, where many of them go to work during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech travel agencies, Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs annually, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here traded the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
Recorded this year was July 7th.
"Thousands of millions of photographs could fit into the transferred data," Silvia Cieslarová, the director of the mobile segment in O2 specified.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
First is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is only fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and an active holiday, for which we do not have so much time to browse on the internet.
"Over Austria, the Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the operator has seen high year-on-year growth in data after the release of roaming charges, the growth is much lower in telephones.
The number of minutes allowed in roaming increased to double last year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates.
"Roaming calls are more used by business customers on business trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golf number one Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere within the next three days at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administration area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, succumbed to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of ambassador of the tournament on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen advocate for this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The Englishman Eales will defend the championship title for the first time, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about this," said Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have a chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament was cancelled a year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when winning me and my wife Sharon really meant a lot.
It was a beautiful time that I will not forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns on domestic soil after celebrating 50 years from the county this year.
This event will be his first participation from the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said about Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed while feeling a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I think I'm doing great.
I am satisfied with the result so far."
The three players will also be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup competition Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be dedicated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, it rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of local "nota" - into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and enjoys it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as laundry in cloudy water from nearby marsh.
A bucket in a room without a roof supplicates the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was assigned no field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"No one dares to wander around the village this afternoon after five o'clock," Bardina says.
It is a rare view of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of public upheaval before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Yakart government, which controlled the entire region except foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and ravaged city, where you can reach after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura Province to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach gripping through the ride.
Mass traffic doesn't work at this place.
The town with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners, have looked at this place.
Prior to the arrival of Christians, locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-woven turban, dark T-shirt and shining skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line and the local child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the land of gold of Indonesia.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of American Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province approximately the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, alone, Freeport extracted $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army to the Papuans.
An investigation conducted in 2005 by the New York Times shows that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the Papua tribal area during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission said.
In the last year alone, Indonesian police arrested over 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report from the Brisbane Archdiocese, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, is particularly popular by the raping and execution of the electric current - and brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to count the number of casualties because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian Human Rights Watch researcher.
The situation was exacerbated by the fact that Papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% claim Christianity, but the demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Locals are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura Province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - Mama-mama (women) - lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised in his 2014 presidential campaign to address inequality and violations of rights.
The former carpenter secured and made his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi hoping to hear our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jakowi, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the dark of the night.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers was this reproach and tone, which was touched and later returned with four other soldiers, said local vicar Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state pursued a group of children and beat them with the stocking of their weapons, stating victims and witnesses of the event.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone torched a nearby electoral commission building, and the following day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field outside the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came up with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - in which they run in circles and imitate the singing of birds - the Papuan Mee Pago tribe.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at buildings.
With increasing tension, an order was issued to the troops via radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot," according to the weekly TIME, in an official document whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to break up in their homes.
But no one had heeded his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," TIME said on the porch of his well-painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people everywhere and a lot of shots were fired," he added.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, one of the local residents, Alfie Youw, was hit three times.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," TIME told the weekly in a gloomy voice by Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told journalists that his officers had only "secured" the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people are threatening us with death," said the press secretary of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiya, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injury.
The murder report went through the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his understanding of the victims' families, promising to engage in violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
Minister of National Security Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
But almost immediately, excuses began to be heard.
“Most violent acts took place a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
However, in a June 5 interview for the weekly TIME held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be brought before the court".
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent election in East Timor, stated that 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, have been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with distrust.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but I haven't seen anything yet," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he claims.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by military members after helping bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army began to look for me," he said.
And the shooting isn't stopping yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
A skirmish, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction firm, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to police, the villagers were throwing stones at them, and the answers were warning shots fired.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) began shooting into the crowd and killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retribution," he told TIME 29-year-old Domingga Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"Two days I didn't leave the house."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes who live in central highlands.
Many of them joined the Movement for Liberation of Papua (OPM) - an army of rebels who protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. They are among not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all this under the pretext of "assuring national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among Papua residents as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Oil pours poverty into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
And bread is unattainable anyway.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are intended for family needs, they sell the rest on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport has opened more routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, economic inequality has increased between native Papuans and immigrants.
As few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to get into business.
"Young people move out of villages due to lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to its isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from Papua due to a "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they were given such a rare permission to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"Foreign journalists who work in the rebellious most eastern areas of Papua and Western Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - ran the UN Human Rights Council on investigations into "various and widespread violent acts" in Papua, including shootings in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanath Nasir dropped the charge by stating to journalists in Jakarta that: “The democratic system is still in force in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people call for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, locals called out by a source that also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto "We want freedom".
More elections are scheduled in Indonesia for 2019, but the Papuans claim they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but is surrounded by people involved in shooting in Paniai," Gobau, Chairman of the Tribal Council, said.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of a robbery army - are rolling in poverty, poor education, and a health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, regard their voice as a “debt” that Jokowi must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the paniaisian shooting, they continue the last symbolic act of defiance: burying the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least they will not let responsible persons forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy picked up a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy intercepted $1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific yacht.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
During the intervention, a four-member crew of a ship was arrested, probably made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was dragged by police after being detained to a port in Nouméa, the French overseas territory metropolis of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence said that, in cooperation with its international partners, it would seek to determine precisely where and where the drugs were headed and to reveal the "Lithian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop large quantities of drugs going to Australia," said its executive director Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street prices.
The country also faces the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first one of these days.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in elderly homes, the solution would be, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádlová, an infusion of saline, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
They're only applied in medical facilities so far.
The older a man is, the more water in his body drops.
"In addition, they lose their feeling of thirst, so the elderly generally receive fewer fluids and are dehydrated very quickly," said Mádlová.
They should drink two liters for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into an old man is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she often says no doctor watches over it.
In hospitals, dehydration is commonly treated with infusions.
"I think that even there should be gradually introduced so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two pints of saline can be delivered to old people in a day.
Fluid deficiency can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration proves to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confusedly," she added.
In case of neglect, it may result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and plugs the vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, maximum cotton sheet.
One-off diapers may also be a problem.
"It's more nursingly demanding, but it would be ideal to expose the patient occasionally and let the skin ventilate," the doctor said.
The Torch skyscraper burned in Dubai for the second time
One of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was on fire in Dubai on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of 337 metres high and 79 storey buildings.
In the last two years, it has been the second fire of this high-rise building to bear the fitting name The Torch (Torch).
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries, the cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard screams.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the skyscraper.
Dubai's civilian defense stated that the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 a.m. (0:00 GMT), then continued cooling the building.
Government officials have added that they provide replacement accommodation for the disabled.
Once again, the incident could spark discussion on the safety of materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which launched the management of the Torch skyscraper following the 2015 fire, showed that the most damaged linings and external panels used to decorate or isolate.
The British police stated that the isolation and lining system of the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, in which nearly 80 people died.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. carry prohibited items on board the aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously performed prohibited objects through the checkpoints of the U.S. government's Transportation Security Administration on board the plane. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have been delayed finding out that they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and answered by more than 1000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to deliberately travel with an object banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours flew compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
The most common items that have escaped TSA attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents deliberately spoke through security of a sharp object, while 2.2 percent of polled women and 3.7 percent of polled men also admitted to deliberately bringing banned drugs on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it was conducting research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried out unauthorized items through airport control and how many did so on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who have transferred unauthorized objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
Often people do not know what fluids and how much they can carry on the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that TSA seized the most banned liquid.
For a time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Liquid transport is permitted within domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on the postponement of the planned Obama administration emission reduction directives
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, her boss Scott Pruitt appealed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes within his plan, reacting more rapidly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal appeal filed against his previous position in the federal appeal court.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October, when states should start to comply with the 2015 Regulation for reducing the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or imminent economic growth".
Pruitt, who served for a long time as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations before being placed in the role of the head of the EPA by President Donald Trump, served as State Attorney General Oklahoma.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
A sudden Wednesday turn is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the EPA executor exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with states using comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
"During the reign of the previous EPA administration, she often did not meet the deadlines and waited for her to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans," said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits to the EPA.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and authority arising from it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can use “the possibility of delays and all other legally available authorities” at some point to ensure that regulations are “based on sound policies and the most accessible information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcript of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure still did not pass the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that were suing the EPA this week, stated that the group did not intend to allow in legal coercion.
"The turnaround in the views of the EPA - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground-floor ozone arises when common harmful substances discharged by cars, power plants, oil refiners, chemical power plants and other sources react in an atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of premature deaths.
Public health advocates and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is disturbing what pressure needs to be exerted to change the thinking of responsible people and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with Trump's ideological campaign to help polluters and special interests."
He spilled acid on a man, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family laughing, the next, your whole life changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was flattened by the acid unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The information was provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christophers'.
Andreas picked up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
The man he'd never seen in his life, he spilled acid on him without warning, saying, "This is for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and all I felt was an incredible pain in my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital quickly, but his loved ones learned a terrible message - according to doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was affected, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
The loss of the eyelids became a major complication for Christopheros.
It's probably the most tortured thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has 12 operations that are far from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, the injuries that victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformity and deformity throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the case properly and subsequently tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, the verdict to the astonishment of Christopher’s family later changed fundamentally.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be lifted as the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the last few years, the numbers of corrosives have increased considerably.
The Home Office there commented on the issue by planning to lay down new guidelines for state representatives on the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But victims of similar attacks are not about to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in various stores, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai was burned at night by the famous The Torch skyscraper, one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the 80-story building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesperson for the Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upward.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were sleeping.
The alarm woke us up, people screamed.
"We drove down the stairs, took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said tenant George.
Another of CNN’s witnesses estimated that the flames had caught about 40 flats.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to a civil defense message, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
The extensive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over 100 flats.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, no one was harmed, as the residents were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became the world's tallest residential building with its 352 metres.
Another Dubai skyscraper robbed him of the record the following year.
A bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substance in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito produced a variety of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, finishing fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugbista David Vatta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record quantity for the caught athletes until then.
According to his words, a three-league player began taking steroids the year before he failed bodybuilding.
Lucky Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged passionately with an ex-lover!
Just as Lucka Vondráčková entered the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And he's also drawing attention to wherever he goes.
Last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older then and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly did not want to hang up her career.
So they separated, but they remained friends to this day.
This was also demonstrated at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both blended in blue.
At first, they ignored each other, but then they became closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal's pranks until she fell behind her stomach.
Then they hugged and posed willingly for the photographers.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, because they will play together a lovers' couple in the new series Prima Captain Exner.
The Islamists were given life in the UK for preparing an assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamist cell called Three Musketeers to prison for life, and according to the prosecution, she planned a terrorist attack against the police and the military.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
Authorities at the time thought he was about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbelieving", and a gunform.
It happened the moment an MI5 intelligence agent placed a listening device in the vehicle.
"Recent assassinations have shown the terror the defendants could have caused if they were not stopped," said prosecutor's attorney Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25, and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, aged 38, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also questioned him, but then dismissed the defendants' claim.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
At Hodonínsk they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With a 38.3 degree Celsius recorded in Strážnice, Hodonínsk, he surpassed it on Thursday, which thus far became the hottest day of this year.
This was confirmed by employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, many temperature records fell on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records for 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years were broken or evened.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice in Břeclavia on Thursday's 37.4 degrees it surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of the degree and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice it was the greatest heat in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, according to ČHMÚ's website, for example in western and northwestern Bohemia, the highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
"The temperatures only started to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually wear off according to ČHMÚ and more heavy rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain still on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions due to visa policy.
For decades, China has sought to exert its influence without the use of force resources.
He spends $10 billion annually to support language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushing his entertainment industry into foreign markets, and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is failing.
The state media there are talking about a plan to turn tourism into a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals rose by only 3.8 percent last year, and roughly 80 percent of tourists came to China from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assessing the situation in the world's most populous country, Professor of Economics from Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
The example that speaks for itself is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contact with China, and the citizens of the others have to deal with the visa in advance.
Thus, at Chinese offices in the US, crowds are comparable to Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in line, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and has less than one percent of all residents, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself when tourism uses its political objectives, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut traffic to South Korea in the spring as a result of a riot around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell 42 percent yoy, while Japan grew 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the Federal Central Bank of America, China could have left as much as $190 billion a year as the Chinese’s foreign travels, while China receives about $35 billion a year as part of the currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on balance of payments, China had a $217 billion deficit in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China’s entire surplus in the merchandise trade.
Thus, a small number of tourists strike a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously obstructing capital outflows.
However, the above mentioned factors are only one sign of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
Until 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
Some cities have more in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the intersection of immigration, has doubles.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
But you can't practically find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian states, especially India and Vietnam, have been making great efforts lately to simplify and make visa procedures cheaper.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsner Zoo, mortally poisonous reptiles were propagated.
The Pilsner Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the cubs of three rare, fatally poisonous reptiles.
At the exhibition visitors will see only all nine newly born vipers of Turkey.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 metres.
"It grows to a meter-long length," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba described.
The cubs of the other two species, mortals and red cobras, meanwhile, will gain strength in the breeding background of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
Australian vipers have come into the world eight, they are descendants of a breeding couple native to the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the mortals around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care, 6-8 weeks of winter is necessary for mortals at 13 degrees Celsius.
100% success was accompanied by a stack of African spitting cobras red.
A couple in the Pilsen Zoo hatched out of four eggs a total of four cubs.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of up to four metres.
It's pointed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species feed on mouse sticks in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they expect hatching of young from the mamba's collection of black, eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of a phone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico to pay for a border wall
The U.S. Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a phone interview on January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump directed him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The U.S. president blamed him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, reportedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump pledged to build a wall along the southern border, announcing that Mexico would pay for it.
He also leaked the transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. refugee surveillance agreement going to Australia was "stupid" and "stupid", insisting that if he agreed to such an agreement - that came out under President Obama's rule - he would look like "drunk" after proposing a ban on the entry of refugees into the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day".
Tusk testified again at the D.A.'s office for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to worry about," said Tusk's address, brother of the dead president, Chairman of the Government Party Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied and read the country's current leadership that they are trying to abuse the judiciary against political rivals.
On leaving the DA's mansion, a TVN 24 TV crowd was waiting for Tusk according to TV, chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
According to his words, he does not blame the prosecutors, but he does not doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against rivals, opposition or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He's been in interrogation for the second time.
The exhibitor has been questioned in the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time he was to be questioned about misconduct in the autopsy of victims of the Smolen disaster.
In addition, the replacement of bodies in coffins was found.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there had to be some reason.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was to serve Donald Tusk to become someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński said on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would frustrate Tusk's chances of gaining the most important seat in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also stated that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the D.A.'s office on April 19.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his subpoenas for questioning considered it part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and PiS Kaczyński's chief to discredit Tusk as a political rival by combining with various scandals.
The prosecution is subordinated to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who performs the role of Attorney General.
The subpoena for questioning came soon after Tusk's election as head of the European Council, to whom Kaczyński worked hard but tried in vain to prevent, among other things, from visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote anywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote newly on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, and is currently in a comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens elected MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its approach.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has been changed," says the material.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which includes the representative offices to which paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes representations of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press version.
They're changing their list with the decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs were allowed to vote at, for example, the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representation in Bamak and Kyoto, Malaysia.
The election will not even be held at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, the Senegalese capital of Dakar, and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation by the Consulate General in Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
The ballots will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to select MPs in polls at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state electoral commission shall designate a county for whose candidates are voted abroad.
This was the first time in 2002 when it was decided among South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemia's candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemia Region was chosen as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, around 3800 people came to vote, in 2006 around 6700, four years later 8222.
Ten,571 voters came to the early House elections four years ago.
Massacre on Moore's Ford Bridge: activists recalled racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by by bystanders of Monroe, Georgia, and crumpled towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
By the time a car with four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge, however, a group of white men with guns had blocked its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - dragged himself from a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, passengers trembled with fear.
"We want this n-and Roger!" shouted the man.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence breaks the roar of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of events that occurred on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
As of 2005, a group of activists regularly return to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has ever been tried for murder.
"It is surprising that in all these years not one person has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the reconstruction of events, let himself hear.
"It is a stain on our history and a burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call for action. Every year the Monroe community reminds that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first," Brooks said.
"In the meantime, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The M.E. is covering one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files received by NBC News news coverage, lynching was to be attended by up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts.
But no one has ever been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, by decision of the Supreme Court, black-skinned people of the state of Georgia were granted the right to participate in the elections for the first time in the summer.
And just during the summer election, according to the FBI, a black-skinned farmer, Roger Malcom, was supposed to stab White-skinned owner Barnett Hester during a skirmish, supposedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was rumored that Hester had been hanging out with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, the then significant owner of Loy Harrison's white-skinned land posted a $600 bail for Malcolm.
Dorothy and his cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
On their return from prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects had blocked their way.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in the lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks spoke more briefly about the matter.
"It was a massacre due to electoral law," he said.
"Murders had a clear subtext for all local black people: 'this is how you will end up if you register and vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event is organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging, and concise, showing deep-rooted racism, which many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even more difficult to look away, but Greene says there's a point to it.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"There cannot be a relationship between us, however, unless you hear what I have been through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and on the first day approximately 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks - piled up in a room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to his words the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, or Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The show begins with a skirmish - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n-e!"
Rascona can't be.
There's a skirmish.
At that point, everyone (at least every black actor) explodes in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene answers cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people used to call 'n-r' that tone."
"Exactly," one of the black actors blurts out.
"You need to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be done for the four victims of the massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct expression of the word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Scream, gunshots... and there's silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of actors and sings the grieving song of Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
With every word in the room, there's sadness.
In the background of all this, about a dozen bystanders wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
In the audience there are virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from New York Ithaca, many bystanders from nearby.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks in the crowd leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders could have been looked at in distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching occurred, the atmosphere is frightening.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites a crowd of bystanders to inspect the bodies.
The children kneel to the heads of the victims, watching false blood and motionless bodies and whispering something in their ear.
"They're not dead," a little boy says.
A few minutes go by, and Greene thanks the audience.
Actors clean up the rope and tear their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two actors-friends and cries in their arms; eventually he gets emotional.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
“We know you hate the role.
But you had a reason for it."
Later the same day, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her feelings about tonight's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to the ugly words and look at the hideous deeds... done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said for the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic," she added, "it's just called police skirmishes."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in a courtroom, enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning the show for the next year.
"Reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about it," he said.
“If we don’t learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
A friend of mine says he only reads the instructions for use to a coward.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I recall a time long past, where the instructions for using anything were rather a rare phenomenon.
So for example, my first gramophone contained only one paper containing hieroglyphs depicting the connection of some components, all of which had some secret markings.
Years later, when something went wrong inside me, I offered the deed to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a smile, he told me what the labyrinth paper was suitable for.
Yes, it was a used aid in chronic toilet paper depletion.
He easily found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl badges again.
New times brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply stuck to the cut grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
Especially good was the sketch with a description of how to insert one piece into the other.
The set was two-part and another procedure was simply not possible.
Putting it in reverse required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic parts.
My contempt for instruction ended with my self-propelled Seat Leon brand.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the exchange of light bulbs.
It was easy.
In total, three steps and the work were to be done.
Unfortunately, the author neglected to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Take out the cover.
2. Unscrew the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3rd, pull up the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the interior of the car I would pick up a spring, a screw by which the cover was easily removed and then I would follow points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
It's a footbridge error.
The shelter had no place, no space for a slender hand of Cinderella, let alone an obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life without any success.
The state was still heightened by the entry of my wife into the garage, which was summoned by a exclamation and words which she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked unwittingly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss vulgar terms, there are only two published words left.
Changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked a sentence that could be her last in a long-term union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the process of curing the author's instructions, where blessing with hot iron on her hand, which she wrote, then by wiping her away, so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of manuals of Hammer on Witches, including his commissionial burning on top of Losin Castle.
"Why don't we remove the box?" meant the woman's installation of the battery.
In pure despair this occurred and then step 1-3 was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just waking up from a collapsing state after checking two civil servants at the State Department of Drug Control.
I know him as a colleague of a balanced man who has experienced both possible and impossible in the field and who can tell wild stories in an unrelenting voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having handwashing instructions posted," she told me in a weak voice.
I gradually got the whole problem out of him, which was that he did not have picture instructions on how to wash his hands above the sink in the patients' bathroom.
His argument to the Commissary that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that it did not take pictograms to handle the usual activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simple washing of washed palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of cro-aponion that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
It must be said that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end is a joyous finding that one washed his hands exactly as ordered by the SÚKL hosudar.
Finally, I must point out that I was inspired and prepared a detailed plan for toilet activity.
On the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in urination, due to certain differences in both sexes, two instructions will need to be put up.
The problem remains the pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all anatomical details, which could arouse a certain outrage in the prude's toilet, despite finally learning that he has been wiping the opening with a completely flawed procedure throughout his life.
Pearson will release 3,000 more employees and reduce the dividend in an attempt to revive the trade
On Friday, the British education group Pearson stated that it would release an additional 3000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another wave of dismissal, which according to the statement of CEO John Fallon will occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, follows the company's previous decision to release 4000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in an attempt to resurrect declining trade as a result of the sharp development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month, stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
An attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, reported by official officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, reported in NATO's statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the Qarabagh district attack.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bombing - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in the Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a home-made explosive device".
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are located in an American military hospital at Bagrám Air Force Base.
As reported by the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a significant source of concern for NATO's Allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb placed in a car killed at least 30 people in the Kabul district of Shia.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city center killed over 150 people. It is the most deadly militant attack in the country since U.S. troops overthrow the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to assist military troops and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have shaken the confidence of the public in the government, its regulations, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Gandhin in recent weeks.
In response to the action, the EPA reconsidered its decision to postpone smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency appealed its decision to postpone the Obama administration's law ordering states to cut emissions, just one day after 15 states sued the Agency.
In Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to refer the “Ozone Standards 2015” with the words that it submitted the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will listen to their views," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure the actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, on the basis of measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, stating that the EPA's negotiations were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an effort to kick economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA reports on its website that Ozone-containing air breathing “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, ” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this quite new singer in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer held a monstrous event in the Czech contexts, where he hosted such prominent personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not hosted by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show up to the public, and to introduce your music video to the song Sara, whose baptism was hosted by just-named personalities.
Few who already know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, was not without problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and did not go without a proper embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramatism of the scene, the singer's sok was supposed to indicate a slap in the video.
At one point, however, he struck him so hard and right in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, immediately my nose started to bleed," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers argued on the set that this was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the sequel to the next filming.
We now bring you the mentioned video clip of a young artist, you can also record the scene with a punch.
The failed version with blood, however, was not better used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweightweight champion - did not come down to the hall where he welcomed Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's cockweight champion.
After Garcia's victory based on a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's showtime match, both boxers made it to the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm a former cockweight champion," Garcia adds.
“Because of the fight with Broner (67 kg) I had to gain weight, but I’m not that big.
I'm small at my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the lightweight category.
He's got to put on a lot of weight to get himself on the easy foot... then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Why not meet them?"
Squirrel agrees.
"The box would be good for this match."
Klimas made a request for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should complete his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year he will compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title in the Forum arena on 23 September.
"The match should take place in the style of viewing payment, that's what fans want," said Garcia, who later said that the possibility of broadcasting the match is open through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else gets that kind of attention.
Let's wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia stated that he recognized Lomachenko as a "wonderful boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But he did not allow Garcia's praise to be lulled when he said that the champion of three divisions from Riverside looked “very slow... sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers stated that they felt an increasing tension in front of each other's duel.
“You can’t forget this game.
No other match draws so much attention to itself.
And I will put a great deal of pleasure on the fire," Garcia said.
He said: “I was waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey. ”
It'll be a great match."
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
They found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Cherkasova have been missing since December 2005.
There's been an extensive search for them, but no success.
And finally, in the absence of evidence, the police ended the investigation.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad ending to the whole story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volha River in the town of Čeboksary, Cuvašsk.
Only thanks to the documents that were left in the car did the police manage to identify a few.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without them it would take police much longer to determine the identity of the found.
The couple were last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
So far, the diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by an frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its conclusion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The most recent results of tests by asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people have been polled as over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensicverket (Rıttsmedicalverket) began new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failure in determining the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has handed over 6880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent of (2002) was assessed as over 18 years of age, while in the next 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered the defendant to be “perhaps over 18 years of age”.
In the next 423 cases, it was decided that the surveyed was “perhaps under the age of 18”.
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the person questioned is disputed.
According to Johan GÃransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
"Compared to the last month, the statistics stick to the track and the numbers are very similar," he said for The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the person concerned is 18 years of age or older".
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the polled one stated that he would be 18 this year.
There was also a medical method of determining age, which includes an X-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of knee joints, which is subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is, among other things, concerned with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person underwent puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue, and I don’t think these types of age measurement are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age accurately, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," Metro reported.
The Forensic Medical Agency Agency Agency Agency's Gìransson advocated the decision by saying: “In general, the risk of misassessment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person questioned is just below the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all those questioned."
Trump threatened the President of Mexico on the phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peño Nieto, threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that financing would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This results from the transcripts of interviews published by the American daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last year's election campaign.
Immediately in his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after joining Trump Penu Nieto, he undiplomaticly reprimanded for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He portrayed the South Neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press that," Trump said repeatedly in an interview dated January 27, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to issue defiant statements.
They say the funding's gonna work out, and it's gonna work out in the end.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," he said, according to the American daily Trump.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but perhaps politically the most important thing.
The executive order for the construction of the Trump wall was issued shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a wall of 3200 kilometres in length, as a result of which the relations of both countries have also escalated.
In late March, Trump said the project would still be valid for the United States.
Trump eventually met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 Summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull of January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
Such a conclusion prompted him to exchange views on the agreement, according to which Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States receiving people from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump at first considered the deal stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you have created, but you will have to stick to it," Trump Turnbull told.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example when Trump appreciated it as a good idea for Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
But the tone of the conversation suddenly escalated.
"I hate the reception of these people," Trump remarked.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people to go work for local milkers," he said.
In an interview, he also noted that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump conducted phone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, roughly a week after coming to the White House, often several during one day.
In the end, he called Turnbull the least pleasant one for the whole day.
Before ending it, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father watched.
The execution took place on the square in Yemenu Saná capital.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose for his sacrifice the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He subsequently raped her body, which he then threw near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl struck the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd that gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd shouting the word "let justice live".
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was taken.
The police put him on his stomach.
One of the members turned his gun against him and fired from immediate range.
The present crowd celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia Law triumphed," he added.
I was standing in Sana's Liberation Square awaiting the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rano's tiny body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hate madness, grab and lynch the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shia Houthi.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 whip wounds after being arrested, but his act aroused such outrage that the judge opted for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, she discovered evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that ran Ran's body was terrible," he told the media.
"The morning disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held, and to demand immediate punishment.
The Justice Department representative read the present crowd a record of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not show pity for his actions.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read him the sentence, but the convicted only glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but many records were recorded online by the crowd.
The governor of West Virginia announced the change of political party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced Thursday night at President Trump's rally that he was crossing into another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats turned their backs on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I am telling you that I can no longer support you from the position of democratic governor."
A crowd of bystanders blew up in joy.
"Tomorrow I will join the Republicans," added Justice.
"As coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised people an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited large property from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement stating: “The defection of Governor Justice is another blow for the Democratic Party, which puts obstacles in our way instead of giving rise to the lifting of our country. ”
"For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the least law enforcement bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is the last straw for an already woeful party without a leader seeking in vain a positive and unifying report," said President RNC Ronna McDanielová in his statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "honest" apology for the doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but again he repeated that the time had not yet come for Russia's return to the sports world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the MS in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “to all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way. ”
Despite his comments, IAAF Congress members voted to maintain the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported doping its athletes.
"I think we have seen a very honest answer and presentation today," Sebastian Coe, President of the IAAF, told journalists.
"All members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and worked hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said that he was also “pleased” that Russia had adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been a great success and we have moved on to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Crisis Staff on maintaining the sentence that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
“In the coming months we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our efforts have always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones," he ended his speech.
At the MS in Athletics, which starts Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF.
The head of the IAAF crisis crew Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being admitted back.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still unsatisfactory and expelled coaches continue to operate, telling reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF board.
The CzechTrade contract was awarded to František Savova, whose state prosecutes.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
Officials awarded him 100 percent of the points in all quality criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecutes Savova for tax fraud and asks for its extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Trade's pro-export agency launched a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A contract worth CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta podniker František Savov.
The Czech police charged him with tax evasion in 2014 and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for its release.
The case was brought to the attention of the server Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award was to be decided from 60 percent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion greatly helped Savov's company.
According to Dotyk.cz information, she received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
This is exactly what moved her in front of another candidate, the publishing house Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with the amount of CZK 404 900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324 350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received 62 points from assessors in all quality criteria below average rating.
The tender was also attended by the consultant company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Aktuálně.cz under the label Economia.
VLM has raised several objections against the result of the tender, considering its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it decided to challenge competition at the Office for the Protection of Competition of ÚOHS.
He believes that CzechTrade has acted in contravention of the law.
"The proposer believes that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public contract supplier on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, a clearly favoring participant of the Young Front, a.s., at the expense of the promoter and other suppliers," the proposal to initiate the procedure filed at ÚOHS this week, published by the server Currently.
According to VLM CEO and board chairman Michal Klíma, scoring the selection committee seems to be an unreliable and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such miraculous success of one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," Klíma said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in the Contractor Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin in accordance with the law.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on its progress," said the media representative of Štěpán Dlouhý.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that Economia had intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it had its own business interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in that article.
In the tender, she could be helped by the fact that she was the one who provided BusinessInfo editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was first competed in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive deductions of VAT by his companies, which caused alleged damage to the Czech state up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO Andrej Babiš movement, under whose influence the label Mafra, is responsible for his criminalization.
The London court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition last year, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any information from the UK regarding the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to date," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague city prosecutor, said for Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov represented in the company Harvester Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the České Budějovice Samson brewery, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
It should also control the failed Heavy Machinery Services company, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with bringing property out of the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker ran down the sidewalks and through the park, ended up in the crumpets.
The biker attracted attention by unscrupulous driving on the streets, pedestrians and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to take her in the direction of the station.
"The officers of a man with increased caution pursued the city when he failed driving on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," said police spokesperson Daniel Dvořák.
Eventually, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, which transported the injured biker to the Pilsen Hospital.
Subsequently, police found that the biker did not own a driver's license, motorcycle registration plates were stolen, his serial number sharpened and the production label itself removed.
It's so possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test performed was ruled out at the site of alcohol presence in the driver, but a positive result on the substance methamphetamine was detected by the test," the police spokesperson added.
How the Financial Rules of Football Will Affect Neymar’s Transfer to Paris
The rules limiting the financing of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The financial fair play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 state that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million in conversion just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar would demand a salary of several tens of millions a year.
Several financial terms follow Neymar's transfer to France.
As the PSG team is funded by a rich Cathar family that has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
The clubs can spend huge sums on the purchase of players, but on the other hand they have to demonstrate legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after being placed in the UEFA Director's seat in 2007.
A former French player believed that clubs that were in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements were ultimately cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected their attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spent horrendous sums for players y to build a global brand - suddenly was not so advantageous.
As part of the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Cheferin is determined to advocate a ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," said Andrea Traverso, the Associated Press, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules last week.
Although the PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in a one-off payment, it may decompose the amount for accounting purposes to the full duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of highest sanctions by the FFP hit in 2014 PSG along with Manchester City, owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
The PSG received a €60 million ($82 million) fine - which was later reduced to €20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors the PSG once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority of the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar's PSG revenue could be reimbursed by the MS Organizing Commission in Football 2022 in Qatar.
However, PSG and MS 2022 officials in Qatar denied the fat that Neymat should become an ambassador to the MS in football and that such a maneuver would easily be revealed by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's insiders, UEFA has not initiated any investigation into Neymara's transfer to the PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as it was not entitled to comment on the PSG situation, said The Associated Press.
The last published accounts show that the PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Spanish League officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate the FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of ‘financial doping' the club and the state," said La Liga president Javier Teba for Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Cathar Syndicate.
Arsenal Arsene Wenger's manager, whose club owns an American sports tycoon, shares the same attitude of the La League on the financing of the club.
"It is a consequence of ownership that has changed the football world from the ground up in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club owner becomes, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have various interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan reserve Rosický: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Thomas Rosicky's on the set.
Same scene as in the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder moved against the Crveny Zvezda game, coined several goals, but his teammates did not head into black.
The Letensky team pumped up with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements thus ends after the opening two-game in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything else about the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the goal was scored, four had to be scored, which was hard for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, raise our confidence, so we could bounce back to the next game.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get to the game for so long?
The game is so worked up.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we fired at halftime like once.
Of course, that's awfully little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final period we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is a large number of changes in the lineup a problem?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We played only three competition matches and the line-up is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the ideal 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging that you have already played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will evolve and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, there's no other way.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta decided somehow, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came again in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
There was another wonderful visit, just like with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
To do something that'll come next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember those visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, the businessman is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is supposed to serve ten years in prison for tax cuts.
The valued damage is CZK 645 million.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the justice had violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
The Constitutional Judges, however, ruled the complaint unfounded, found CTK from the court database.
The ÚS is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as the fourth instance, assess the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by general courts if they do not constitute an infringement of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, it was also located at the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The penalty imposed is at the top of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage suffered.
The Supreme Court referred to the case as an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Service between 2005 and 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was created only during the period from January to July 2008, the total leak, according to the expert, exceeded a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the whole amount.
According to the prosecution, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in mere statistics.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company was trading have a relationship with the businessman Radomír Vykelec, to whom the judiciary has charged 13 years in prison for VAT machinations in fuel stores.
Also his complaint was rejected a while ago by the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic to both figures from the famous 1980s; as well to dirty 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch "The State"; and, of course, also for modern times, specifically 2001, before stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd scattered on larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody as well as the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the franchise's point of view, it looks like someone's breathing is running out.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to absurd humour (for example, the story of the emergence of a talking can of vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin has told).
The authors diverted from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults do not push so much to the emotional level and satire is sometimes sporadic, including parody to the 1990s thrillers as "Hand on the cradle".
At one point, the character finds Apple Powerbook on a pile of junk, roller skates, and "a lot of other things from 1991".
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now the writer, still did not get over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), prompted by George H. W. Bush (very well cast by Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair alias figure of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
Franchuise could be triggered by moments of random insanity, such as the returning series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I assume will be a logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the whole group embarks on the premiere of "Summer to Survive".
In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: Cold War Revivalism of the series "Such Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regret" and even the series "GLOW", in which icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes clash.
The comedy of creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak directed by Rhys Thomas is to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania of the 1980s who are fighting for truth and atheism after a manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - tenacious Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, which were dubbed into the English language by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
In some jokes you laugh (such as police officers watching chess on TV - parody of American football).
The series was lent its voice by many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a killer with Reagan's mask - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too distraught and comedy moments aren't enough.
With a shorter track, the propaganda satire could work in "Comrade Detective", such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly attend the U.S. Embassy, in which two fat people devour hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message to imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The fictional Romanian creators were right: we do so with our own culture, as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not get the IAAF launch ban lifted.
The IAAF International Athletic Federation at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on starting Russian competitors due to the state-supported doping program.
The vote in the event of the World Championship, which will start on Friday, was very clear as expected.
To prolong the ban, 166 delegates spoke out, against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the rejection is mainly the fact that Russia is failing to meet all requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before Congress by the Chief of Special Investigation Group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban should continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been interviewed and there are still coaches working in the country with a damaged reputation.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not fully operational yet.
However, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," Sebastian Coe, Chairman of the IAAF, said.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians will attend, who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start in national colours at the championship and will not play the Russian anthem if they win.
The Bank of England shall hold the interest rate at 0,25 %
England’s bank should, as expected, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by a lack of economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has stifled speculation on sharp growth.
England's bank warned that economic growth would remain "backward" in connection with maintaining interest rates - despite wringing family budgets.
Policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) The Bank of England voted six-to-two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote on the interest rate increase supported bland economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family budget reductions would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that growth should occur over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit, and also stated that movitities rents should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, as of next February, the Future Fund Plan should start to apply, offering cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England has stated that it will now offer £15 billion less than planned.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: "MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household income and consumption burdens."
On the subject of rates, the bank stated that it would need to ‘tighten money policy belts’ to calm inflation, namely ‘to a greater extent’ than markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "slight" and "limited".
The bank reduced the growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The projected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
Following the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euro.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should be slightly increased by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor salary increases.
The report further states that monetary policy 'cannot prevent' cuts in revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to 'significantly' rise towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also increase due to the great interest in British goods thanks to a weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after last August rates were reduced to 0.025% in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that the complete unification of prices and economies will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with increasing inflation, which exerted increasing pressure on households, and three political officials demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it expected such a change and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank stated that the excess relative to the 2 % target was ‘completely’ due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Because of the recent fall in swap rates, competition on the mortgage market seems to only rise once creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and re mortgages - there are no fees available in the offer, as well as low rates they earn in popularity."
NHS prescribes a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will gain access to ‘transformative’ treatment to prevent HIV from September on the basis of a decision by the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) reported that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through health services to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance a probationary period after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court decision of last year, stating that NHS had funds to pay for PREP despite a statement that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a ‘deciding moment'.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to begin receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 full implementation will take place across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a pre-sex HIV drug to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
Injecting PREP before sex means that the patient's body contains enough specific drugs to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who will sign their consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program comes to taxpayers at £10 million, and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute drugs after obtaining an international public contract.
The test period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PREP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should be complemented and fully burdened by the ever-extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years of effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, Managing Director of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: ‘We are witnessing a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients who are at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to persuade a partner, leading to improvements in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, the executive director of Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests throughout the country; we must ensure that it is accessible to every patient.
We now have a PrEP test drug at our disposal, and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Secretary of Health Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the cessation of transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Follow-up tests will take us one step closer to a full understanding of the PREP benefits.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people exposed to HIV and together to end the spread of HIV in society.'
High-Length Life: Mezzanine and Smart Design Turned This Small Apartment Into Earls Court's Spacious Home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate banker, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of the smart terrace of Queen Anne - and is an illustrative display of modern design, which uses the maximum space available.
"Previously, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge district," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something for a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away and said yes to him the same day."
Since then, he has passed the apartment of 1000 square meters of complete renovation.
One-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storerooms and mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed's design and design studio based in Notting Hill and used a nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps would rise above each other - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which one could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on each other - and at the same time add to playwrights.
On the mezzanine floor, he looks down on the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and it looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Sloppy kitchens are nothing new.
But what is unique about this solution is the tipping door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan talks about reinforced veneered doors.
"The doors are equipped with counterweights to roll away very easily."
Thanks to smart use of space and storage space, Joanne received another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to that, what you're selling is a living area - or an appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
"The real estate broker essentially calculates the price on the basis of the living space when entering the apartment."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space while maintaining quality materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with home," Erfan added.
“You don’t love the power lines in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts will not be won."
As it turns out, quality design and the increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can eventually decide to stay.
The United States is disintegrating.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on travel by its citizens to the state of Tennessee and the other seven states.
The Tennessee State retaliated and declared a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, US citizens can travel freely throughout all 50 states.
It is that California has banned the spending of state money on the trips of its citizens to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT, and any manifestation of disagreement with LGBT's lifestyle considers discrimination.
Tennessee, however, adopted a law of conscience that states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with LGBT patient therapy is not obliged to provide it to them, but has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
In turn, Texas and other states have passed laws according to which religious charitable organizations, which have received children from mothers after birth to adoption, do not have the obligation to provide such children with equal sexual couples to adopt.
Because of these laws of conscience, California has banned the funding of its citizens' travels to eight states of the Union from its means.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have trips to scientific symposiums in Texas, for example, cashed from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They need either federal grants to travel, but it's absurd for the federal government to fund citizens' trips from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and his parliament has passed a law with a resolution that he also dislikes California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerances for illegal immigrants, but yet he does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's putting them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same happens to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban on any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
These are facts, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on conscience reservations as well as decide what their money will go to and what they cannot do.
Second, what is wrong with conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty when butchers offering pork are enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or alcohol-containing cakes.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes with hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that constitutional rights of all Federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policy in powers that are not federal, according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California could be California and Texas could be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and letting live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance to themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one must ever again express moral, religious, or philosophical opposition to LGBT's lifestyle, and if he does so, he should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history where states have done this on purpose because of political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the days of the Negro civil rights struggle, where the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1850s, the political case was slavery, and the Northern War against the South was imminent.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the Blue Democratic and Red Republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disintegrating internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic got a greasy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalnyj was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules before the presidential election, which will take place next year.
The court fined him for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to bid for the head of state in March next year.
The reigning Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He fined him for calling people out for demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube Internet portal.
The fine is 300,000.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the judgment politically motivated.
The fines of 300,000 rubles, including 25,000 rubles, were also imposed by the court on Thursday by two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny joined Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
Authorities are trying to defend the Naval in every way possible in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence due to the theft of the Kirovles forestry business.
In May, the verdict was confirmed by the Court of Appeals.
The verdict is so final, which, according to Russian laws, prevents Naval from running.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are lashing out for one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis resides at the Toorak estate, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who drove the dispute over common property and business assets to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being disputed before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this site, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
With money, additional properties were purchased and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, flats at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who according to Paul's words is a "significant driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court files state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages real estate for $176 million.
For Paul, it was the distribution of property and funds that became troubled.
"Colin's motion came out prominently in my eyes in his favour," Paul wrote in a sworn statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at peace, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, Colin cut off.
Colin contradicts that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin stated that he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that family is the most important thing," he wrote.
The cost of court standings is rising. Hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defending both parties.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With money raised by building property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little, about a 10-year-old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis stated that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, she hoped that the transfer of property to the sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin stated that Mark was compensated with $10 million and Luke with $26 million on his departure.
As Paul stated, both Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation".
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He only answered Colin through a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to settle the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of Colin's statements in court, he stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation," he let himself be heard and added, "he still hopes for a successful solution".
On Friday, all hope was out of sight.
"Our disputes will be resolved in the near future in court," Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers get water and summer clothes.
In the Na Chodovec kindergarten in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The kindergarten is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a big shadow.
There's no pool, but teachers shower in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children remain in classes where blinds and curtains are closed.
The air is trying to cool the air cleaner because they don't have air conditioning.
It's hard even for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation during this period," said Miloslava Makovičková, the kindergarten director.
There's a glass corridor in kindergarten where she says the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6:00, the windows close, and we have blinds on the south side to protect ourselves.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree there, there's a table underneath it, and we do things there," said the kindergarten director Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers try to go to the woods with their children, where they are cooler.
Children's wet caps and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a manual pressure sprayer that is used for flower spraying, and we use it to shower children," Kompanová said.
Also, the kindergarten director at Novoborská Street in Prague's Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers try to keep their children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a rather grown garden, so they are there under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a low-sweet tea or dilute juice, and they have a water drink in the garden.
Each day, they also eat vegetable salad and always fresh fruit and vegetables, sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe today one mother brought about ten kilos of melon for the children," she added.
Drivers receive water or a summer uniform.
The Prague DPP transport company provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
In most cases, tram and bus drivers' cabs are air-conditioned, said DPP spokesman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabs, some trams are air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not seriously damaged anything yet.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have sufficient drinks.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points, and roadways," said Řehková.
In the rolling stock and in some alternate places, employees have so-called sodovars, which produce cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," she added.
Hot and dry weather in recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic liquidated 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday through the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic were rising over 35 degrees Celsius, he employed firefighters mainly fighting fire.
"They predominate fires in the natural environment as well as those associated with harvest work," said firefighters spokesperson Nicole Zaoral.
Even evening weather change brought relief to the firefighters, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and torrential rainfalls.
In connection with the storms, firefighters set off for 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"The most interfered in the Central Bohemia Region," Zaoral continues.
The help of firefighters was also in Stvolínky in Českolipsko, where due to the storm they evacuated 60 people from the children's camp to safety.
Tropical temperatures have also added work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, ambulances were leaving for dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the car.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warn rescuers.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Signs of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and fainting sensations.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media diet
Before him, many tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
The Politico portal stated that the new Chief of Staff in the White House plans to limit President Trump's information flow - including news reports in TV news - in hopes of keeping Trump on the surface.
Here's part of Josh Dawsey's reporter report:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met on the first day in a new position with staff, he outlined the key problem of Trump’s White House, which intends to correct: incorrect information that comes into the hands of the President.
Kelly announced to the staff that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a word of speech - because the President can make better decisions on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth to control Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reports, it was fitting to show him that in a positive light he was spoken of by a lot of other media that was easier to convince," he said in February for Politico Sam Nunberg, a former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmeri, of the Politico portal, then wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets at bay - at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that praises him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something other people don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't checked.
We'll probably never know about tweets Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
However, no one has yet managed to regularly prevent Trump from encouraging controversial topics.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by substituting materials - which can, but may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisors to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“Current and former Trump officials say that the President often responds very angryly to negative news from the media, especially news of leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone slipped the president a copy of the GotNews.com article - the website of the provocative Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the 'source of many leaks of information' from the White House.
Regardless of Johnson being banished from Twitter forever for harassment; or that he has not supported his claims with any evidence; or that he has already posted false accusations in the past and later recanted them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff of Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “tryed to implement the system to manage and document the information President Trump receives".
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to pursue the same strategy.
Maybe he turns out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just disappear, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaire Quarter'
Several of the most mobile homeowners in the English county of West Midland again embark on a battle with determined tourists who negotiate with local authorities on the rights to regain the field for their settlements.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a thriving street in Solihull, called the “millionarian neighborhood. ”
Bringing horses, children, and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. They did not fear even a ditch which was excavated on site on the basis of an authority order in order to prevent their incursion.
A tactful group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected gap that served for the journey.
The angry residents of the neighborhood attacked the Solihull City Board of Directors, saying that ‘she is unable to solve the problem'.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said: ‘ They took the place Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Governing Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to a different place and now they're back.
More arrived last night, and probably more will come today.'
She added that : ‘Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem, using court orders to protect parks.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I don't want to pay any more taxes until the board settles with tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: “It’s ridiculous, we just watched the last traveling tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought horses with them.'
Solihull City Board press secretary said: ‘We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or unlawful conduct to the police at number 101.
This will give us the overall picture that we will present in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special delivered the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under constant control of Slovak physicians on board the plane.
The long-planned flight was without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský, according to information, TV JOJ had a serious accident in Brussels early in the summer.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After transport to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of Bratislava's hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská by NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
The Italians are adhering to the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships coming to the coast of Italy with Mediterranean immigrants unless NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Retettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization refused to comment on the matter due to allegations by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"It is and will always be a priority for us to save people's lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social networks.
"We can comment on all current allegations only after gathering all information and evaluating the situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, which were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
According to the prosecutor’s file, at least one meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, and the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The code of conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer aboard ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS, and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation stated on Thursday that new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" as regards rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct was also rejected by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has let himself be heard that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks landing in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
"We are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel in the last few days," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations to take place this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarosova: She had both silicone and cellulite coming out of the oval!
Hot summer days are all about taking on the most necessary things to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting in Prague Zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone who has to do with TV Prima, it was just swarming, she wrapped her body in a mini-overal.
And all it took was a few normal moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
Because he's been cutting through her cheeks many times, and he's gotten so high, she's had to adjust it all the time.
She certainly did not need the attention of the masters and photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages encouraging Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of two-year imprisonment and then spend five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took her own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father testified in court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened with up to 20 years imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter stood while proclaiming a judgment on the spot with tears in her eyes, with her hands down, and her eyes facing the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
However, Carter’s attorney said that these were “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder has no significant impact on her actions. ”
The plaintiff read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “It will not go a day without mourning the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will bear with us forever," said the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was "following" her knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of a person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I'm going to carry for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person assisting in the suicide of another person, thus establishing a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were released that instigated suicide.
"For example, hang yourself, jump off the building or stab yourself, I don't care," wrote Carter in a text message sent only two weeks before his death while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the generator and be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from making any comment in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison. ”
Audi adjusts up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just the day before the notification, the Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of the BMW - which are considering banning or reducing diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide emission regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide that emits diesel engines is considered to be a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, making it difficult for cars to compete.
While German car manufacturers face careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces allegations of spoiling powerful automobile companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars, which, while testing, reduced the amount of emissions issued, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics of the engine development department in the Audi would have been arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation by the German police in the matter of the Volkswagen car factory after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to bypass the European emission limits - thus extending the charges that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of an Audi car manufacturer in the investigation may have an adverse impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer forms an disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane crash landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred at Praia de São João Beach in the Costa da Caparica area, approximately 30 kilometres (30 km) south of Lisbon.
One witness told SIC Noticias television channel that the plane had flown just before landing over people sunbathing on the beach.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both escaped from the accident alive, and police officers took them in for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even completeable?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it started to be built in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, Wall Highway D11.
The construction of another section of it for at least a few months was newly stopped by the Earth Children movement.
We East Bohemians get freeways by bit, like they cut sausage.
They cut the wheel, and then we'll see when and if we get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite currents of trucks go straight through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a reasonable roundabout.
But so far, the last stretch of our dream highway was launched in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a damn thing since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradec Kralove recently began to be built, and on other sections to Jaroměř, an archaeological survey began with the construction beginning at the end of this year, you could hear a loud bang of the plugs in eastern Bohemia.
Nobody believed it anymore.
Last week, it turns out there's no construction this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno gave decay.
Earth's children repeat their D1 tactics.
They contested the building permit decision in its entirety.
In decomposition, they request a review of all already issued binding opinions of all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, from D11 we ride near the village with the eloquent name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we prefer to then get into the column.
Worst of all, you see stories like this all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Funeral.
What do Earth Children demand?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network practically inconclusive in the existing system?
Read in the new Reflex.
Lavender from Provence Threatens Climate Change
Lavender have become a symbol of Provence in the South East region of France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Lavender is dwindling as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, causing dismay on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “Lavendering in Provence has been threatened because over the past few years this plant has been exposed to climate changes that bring less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
The cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in a dry climate are also to blame."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil they produce is an important component of perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped, and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution can be more efficient water distribution and slowing of water evaporation from the soil, but also spraying of lavender protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes growing threats in Mexico
Riodoc weekly staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the riots in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and constant drug wars.
Today, however, it meets under the strain of recent events mainly for its own safety.
They learn it's important that they change their habits.
Two deserving journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking your children with you to an office that someone attacked in 2009 with a grenade or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to state names for every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and premonition.
Picking them from what - drug traffickers, politicians, traders, and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence continues and the bodies rise to a mass across the country; journalists among them are constantly increasing: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pen Nieto's rise to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and seven were killed in all seven states this year.
Among them also co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence involved in the drug trade.
His loss is felt, even though his presence is all-protruding - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice" on which the middle finger points, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - aged over 30, have a T-shirt with a photograph of Valdez with a smile on their face, glasses on their nose and a Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010, in order to solve journalist cases, she still sued two suspects, according to the opinion of the Committee on Journal Protection.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, so journalists' killers are exceptionally brought to trial.
Riodoc journalists insist on informing about the violence that is happening in Sinaloa; even though they are the destruction of grief and the said territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without the vision of justice, the Security Meeting is irrelevant, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoc headquarters in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently due to the name of the article - which can be translated as the 12th River.
The shooters then boarded his vehicle and crashed it near the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind his wife and two grown children.
Rumors seem to spread rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzmán and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of embellished two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “proportion” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoc still accuses himself of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two errors contributed to his death.
The first was the February release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
The peace could anger the sons; suspicious gang members bought all copies of the newspaper at the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in both Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the periodical, Noroeste was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and set up together with five fellow Riodocs.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning the drug trade," Bojorquez said.
With time, Riodoc gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to embark on a search for troubled topics and publish lyrics without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the founding, Riodoc won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
The same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said in accepting the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “a way of life,” Valdez said last October in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the role of journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?'."
Riodoc employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: has this routine caused his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you get involved with their wives, children, clean stores, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The trouble is, Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal said that “the smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the Javier thing happened."
The old rules according to him, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief before a 40-degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoc, located in a four-story building in the Culiacan City District.
Journalists are making fun of whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been a few months since journalists last set out in mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also have a candle on the suspected government spending that took place in the home town of the governor of the state.
There have also recently been several abductions at one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state's attorney's office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were alert when they were about to write about what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant was a favorite destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist reads from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for nearly a century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption in high posts.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's sons "El Chapo" Guzmán escaped the Army Intervention Unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly crack the case," said Villarreal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim character.
"Now all informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest killing journalists. Employees certainly did not expect to become press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out to demonstrate in front of the U.S. Attorney's office the following morning due to another journalist.
Salvador Adam disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a charred body was discovered, and the authorities say that based on DNA analysis, it's Adam.
Journalists' activity is escalating across the country, many of which organize protests and scribble on sidewalks and "SOS Press" buildings.
The newspaper director Bojorquez is on a day's visit to Washington, where he tries to gain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, held the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murder for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she requested a transfer to another department for concern that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "pretended" by organized crime, corrupt officials, and indifferent public.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism", he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the order of politicians and security forces who work with organized crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused more than half of all attacks on journalists police officers and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," added Ramirez.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note reportedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: “This is how I ended up for my news. ”
There were keyboards and headphones next to the severed head.
Some branches decided to cease activities, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breachová.
Others are still continuing, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez approached public drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, each day poses a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It is Friday midnight and Riodoc staff sit on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest release sent to the printer - drinking beer when suddenly the phone starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
War is escalating, just as many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
Not one day goes by and the opening title changes again.
The sound of police sirens points to another shootout.
Bojorquez throws a fleeting look at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloe - all Riodoc employees follow his steps.
"How could we possibly think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "when one intern asked me to send her to the streets the same day Javier was killed?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first finds of an amazing creature the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called 'Mona Lisa dinosaurs' - found a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high extent that experts were able to determine the reddish - brown color of his scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past'.
An article in Current Biology reported that it was “the most preserved yet found armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world. ”
The fossil is a new species of family Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived during the Creed period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described him with the words “remarkable indeed”.
According to National Geographic, the armored white-eater is still the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Found by Shawn Funk, who revealed the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across something that looked like an alien object and decided to examine it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is done, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
'It's enough to turn a blind eye and believe he's asleep,' said the work manager Caleb Brown and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
'It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and surviving species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
By studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank - most likely faced a serious threat from flesh-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system that uses many today’s animals.
Experts claim that this allowed him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. It is currently available for inspection at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours carefully revealing the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved condition of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a masking method commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this cloaking effect is common in nature, researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
Thus, it is possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation in survival.
Many of the current animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebra or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, indicating that the nosodaurus had to fight for its surviving literally.
'Predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,' said Brown.
A chemical analysis of the organic components contained in scales also revealed that dinosaur skin was likely to have red-brown coloring.
Researchers are continuing to study the animal and are searching for further knowledge of its life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down its last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta area at the time, the climate was the same as in Florida today, and rivers and oceans stretched much further inland than they are today.
'This nodosaurus is indeed remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,' said Brown.
‘For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as in the Cretaceous Age.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to turn your eyes a little bit, and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the Cretaceous period, giant terrapods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who moved on two legs, walked the Earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been a favorite prey of his equally horrifying ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaur, a 11.5 meter-long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Found by Shawn Funk, who revealed the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is additionally complete from snout to hip.
The animal averaged 5 metres in length and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm spikes protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore was wandering the territory of Canada today until he ended up in a river that washed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote wrote for National Geographic, ‘finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking I find him.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count scales on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York City, a native of St. Louis sat down on a bed in the Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
In doing so, she came across the contribution of a high school student.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old youth whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She wondered that no one else had written her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah kept retweeting her posts on the wall.
Rapper of St. Louis posted his posts on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old youth who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying helplessly on the street, where no one took him out after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put the phone away to get back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign saying "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She was watching live news - one of the officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and at his other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she said, held in his hand the gun with which he aimed at the crowd and shouted: “I will kill all of you... animals. ”
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and can call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the next three years describes the new documentary “Whose Streets? ”, which will be inducted into cinemas on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and incorruptibility told from the perspective of people living in a community who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower jersey and the same flower headband - on a subject they had discussed many times before - "about experience with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" remembers the interview.
"Now we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"There was no way I would take her with me," Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the culmination... that occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grew up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time it needed to know the difference between the different layers of experience with black people and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is no different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only harm her."
Upon arriving in Ferguson, the first stop of the South Florissant Road was opposite the police department, which became the base of activists who expected the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his eventual participation in the incident.
Here Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing for the other food.
Together, they prepared food in bags and helped distribute it to Protestants.
A new type of activism was slowly born in Ferrell's eyes.
"My activism turned upside down after 9 August," Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis college, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell became acquainted with the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell wondered: “Do you work on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that can be used? ”
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to earn money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unquenched interview: “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that. ”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the project was also inteserrated by Ferrell and along with six other locals who were followed by the "Whose Streets" team in the years following Brown's assassination.
"In this document, no one speaks for us, but it is our statement," Davis said.
"This was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to see that the movement "is not about the savior leader, but about the rapprochement of the community," Folayan said - it turned out to be the most open to participating in filmmaking.
The document “Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, for example, as she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment when she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and to humanize black people, I had to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on the social media campaign below #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leading positions ultimately stand behind the preservation of the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that “the move is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
However, she insists that "this is not just an affirative matter" and Ferrell is not the main protagonist of the documentary because of her views.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she found herself in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these intersections in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the surge of energy even in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television station cameras cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving two and a half years of probation for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the social political atmosphere in the area she calls home as a "disorder."
Still, it does not cease its efforts, to which it has committed itself since it set off on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
All we have to lose are our chains."
There was a field on fire in Cologne.
There were dozens of firefighters on the scene, a helicopter helped.
Near České Brod in Cologne, between Bylany and Liblice, there was a fire from the 14:00 field of approximately 15 hectares.
Fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firefighters declared a third stage fire alarm out of four possibles.
According to firefighters spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, a helicopter helped put out the fire from the air.
At 18:00, the firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for CZK 70,000.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire arose due to a technical defect in the engine compartment of the combiner.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"We gave the owner the place of intervention until 8:00 tomorrow morning to be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: An artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery are placed several faces of different skin shades - white, black and brown - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each one of them seems to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of secret cable recorders on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines her experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence reduced Obama three days before his retirement from the post of President of the United States.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual comment on DNA subserviency - as well as many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken since she was young about being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty charges, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were held by prison employees, and only one black-and-white low-quality photo, to which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig she is now associated.
In 2015, positive responses to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions continued to resonate.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They prepared an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to supplement the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of opening a new exhibition.
However, visitations and photography were not allowed, so they approached Chelsea asking if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Supressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama asked for Manning's release a few days after the comic was released, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people seeking to publish government information and transgender troops while trying to find new ways to instigate resentments in areas he should promote with his tweets.
In response to the question regarding this special timing Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything is happening for a reason".
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is dotted with her heart) after the end of "self-acting factionism, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centipede of letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to a sophisticated scientific dictionary artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope that people will get away with it, that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg. Her 2007 work Spurious Memories on the topic of video is also available.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging into King Kong's way from United States Disiplinary Barracks Prison with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition personally - which was predicted in the comic book - but when she does, she will be welcomed in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic forms, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like crowds," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor of Northwest University and employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
These days, a nationwide search is underway for a professor at Northwest University and employees at Oxford University who are being prosecuted for suspecting the murder of a man found stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment, said police.
A first-degree murder warrant was issued on Monday for a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County court file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
Chicago Police stated that the deceased's body was found on July 27.
Upon arrival at Grand Plaza Apartments, the police found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a murder while police are searching for both suspects, stating authorities.
Lathem worked on the position of Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology of the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now under investigation by the competent authorities and the University of Northwest fully cooperates with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College stated in a statement sent by e-mail: “We were contacted by the British police, and we are prepared to assist the U.S. police as well. ”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole reality and wish him to apply to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations with the Chicago Police Department, stated that he called on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"Police have information on their whereabouts and efforts to track down suspects are escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional, and national authorities assist in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi stated that it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza leadership released a statement for all residents: “Police are now working on compiling the time list and profile of the victim, investigating various motives, including domestic violence. ”
"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of Russian Government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitala Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“A part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to pass the Code - which describes the criteria for renewing the validity of the RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the code contains nothing that should concern Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren about the alleged sponsorship of doping Russian athletes by the government.
On the subject, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation, as our anti-doping system obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there were no state programs in our country and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutek's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, Smirnov admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, adding: “On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of performing doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After visiting the Moscow headquarters of the organization in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was "on the right track" to renew its validity.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police accused three men of setting a Wednesday fire of a rare wooden church in Třinec-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místeck.
One accused is a minor, all three are Czech nationalities.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a general threat offence.
The reporters were told today by Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"It's a very fresh matter, and police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Kuzel said.
He stated that the police would discuss the possible detention of the accused.
Further information, according to the Director, cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say more yet, because the workers of the criminal police service and investigation and the prosecutor who oversees the matter are actually working on the matter," Kuzel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Material damage is estimated to go to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the other costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parishes, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed the fire fifteen years ago.
It was caused by an electrical failure at the time.
Then an exact copy was created in his place.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for associations used in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the Citizens' Preparedness Act is envisaged to defend the state.
The Ministry of Defence, which was tasked with processing it from the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical prowess of Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of defence.
According to its authors, the basic aim of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech Republic residents to defend the state, outside of the exercise of defence duties and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the state would financially or materially support the associations of amateurs, gunmen or cynologists and would enable them to increase their members' capabilities.
In return, he would obtain data on people who, if necessary, are willing to lose the country at a time of crisis to help, and on their abilities or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors to help associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It is also expected to organize discussions with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be established to be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their capabilities only after the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious borders between different types of threats," the intention is to refer to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials have noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting as wide a range of capabilities as possible, not just those of the military.
"The primary objective of the project is to create a very broad base that allows every citizen to respond skillfully to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to carry out their tasks," he states.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Authority foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to pay or build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that there would have to be an extension of the scope of regional military headquarters, which together would employ another 42 soldiers.
Prior to that, representatives of the Ministry said that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union Arms Directive.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups to help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of her e-commerce startup staff, but she did not find an adequate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unprofitable, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the entire process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the hair care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New human resources startups are constantly appearing in the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intent to measure employees' duties, startups allow companies to vote quickly, target specific teams and demographic groups, also offers complete employee anonymity and a hotline for filing complaints, and in some cases also allows informants to bypass superiors and contact the director directly.
“There are instruments like Strava and Fitbit on the market that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the startup of Glint based in Reedwood City.
Errett stated that Glint made her more aware of what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and the vote of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a brief overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low rating managers - which allows the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to pay attention to the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is thrown into scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the corporate environment and harassing employees who dare speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global sector of control, regulation and compliance by 2020 may exceed $18.8 billion.
The startup convercent of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies in preventing and detecting inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 convercent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
He also recently accepted Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send customizable "bleak" surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Public Opinions has authorised regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the startup of Conversion.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behaviour - and if regulators do not intervene - it can face costly consequences due to customer boycott, staff exhaustion or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses the Convergence for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace a phone number or e-mail to the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
Often it was a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general representative of Ruby Tuesday, according to which previously there was no reliable way to track complaints from employees.
Now that the company is using the Convertent, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been reached before by managers, sitting in offices, for miles away to deal with complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"This is closer to a holistic, overall view of employees' experience," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's group overseeing risk management.
"We also protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
The companies ceased to take the ethics, values and participation of employees lightly in 2002 after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed after Enron's fall in the matter of abuse of employee ethics rights, Quinlan said.
But it was only when the social media “lighted on the whole thing,” that companies began to realize that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by courageous capital investors, which supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent raised $10 million in total from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took away $47 million in capital.
Glint earned $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of researches clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits of LinkedIn, which uses both Convergence and Glint.
Investors earn if companies thrive and companies prosper if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool emerges on the market to ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to the company, it is no wonder that a lot of investors will be found to support this effort.
According to experts on working culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that when a company applies for feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and lack of interest for employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that relied too much on the data itself.
“ Because once you don’t finish things, the employees begin to wonder, ‘ Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts a survey among employees every month, is able to solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, said Errett.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and communication quality, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to resolve the problem successfully.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term in a field known for frequent redundancies.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," added Vitrano.
“And once you start losing your employees, you lose your customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday became the hottest day ever.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice, Hodonínsk.
He overcame the Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about this.
Compared to Tuesday Thursday, but not many temperature records fell.
Vedra hit Moravia mainly, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records for 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years were broken or evened.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice, today's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, today's 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of the degree and in Pohořelice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice it was the greatest heat in Dyjákovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the other hand, according to ČHMÚ's website, for example in western and northwestern Bohemia, today's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures only started to grow there later this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually wear off according to ČHMÚ and more heavy rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain still on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We've had such a bad time here.
Billionaires are not enough with the same vote in the election as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as cheeky as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, buys political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues in the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejškovy Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is funded by the insurance and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Party of Privates.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project Andrei Babiš accidentally named Kroměříž mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for himself.
The Mayors have also recently captured their billionaire.
It is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the company on Jablotron security equipment.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The Entrée in the mayor's uniform didn't work out so well for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win twenty percent in the election.
Some of them smiled.
But Grandpa's slip is rather characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinion.
Although he intends to apply for voter votes in the Mayors' jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babiš.
The grandfather supported Babiš in the past parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule over the pleasurable rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 election.
But he's not going into politics because he wants to do better in person.
Babiš will remain a hero for me.
He's willing to step out of his world that's under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to collaborate with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stands up for himself no matter what jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending his B to the Mayors to build someone this clumsy.
Others may wonder if Jablotron's boss and Agrofert did not break up in a bad way at the store and seek another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Grandpa's first public appearances didn't just revolve around Babiš.
Grandpa promised to send 10 million crowns to the Mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to stop saying that.
After all, the court-recognised thug Zdeněk Bakala spent millions on all sides before the 2010 election.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the citizens' Democrats came together like this for nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
When Grandpa enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he wouldn't have to ask why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
He crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax advantages of families with studied children.
People with higher education will spend about 50 grand a month in our country.
The ones with the basics at less than 20.
A man with 50 grand is rich in local circumstances.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather's vision of society, the poor pay taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state in which they do not participate too much.
In short, rich ones need to be helped not to work hard.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš can wash his hands.
Thanks to Grandpa, the rest of us can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those members and members of their party and citizens and citizens of the state do not hold their employees and the country for their property.
And finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich country, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have reduced by 234 million.
Sometimes selling real estate isn't easy.
And sometimes not even 11 bedrooms, beautiful sea views, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible £8 million.
It was informed by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Greetfully, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the U.S. president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible £8 million.
The original property price was £21.5 million, the final price fell to £13 million.
Even after the sale, the villa complex stands about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And no wonder.
The impressive 5 acres mansion on Saint Martin Island of Caribbean has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many canteens, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the property.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers has shown itself on the prize.
Now the property is closer to the common prices of property on the island.
Trump purchased the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on Saint Martin Island.
But with a new award, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA decided to end two trainings a day.
The 11th in the morning is coming, and UCLA football players are squirming at the sidelines of the new school field.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal sweaty backs, the unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members of these few minutes of doing nothing supplicates the lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will leave for the rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place at 6:30 p.m.
"These guys are going to be working hard the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday rolled over on Tuesday.
By eliminating two trainings on one day, the NCAA wants to lighten the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
This is why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - to fit into already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, Bruins practice camp begins a week before last year and trainings are limited for the summer semester.
A total of eighteen trainings are scheduled until August 20, then formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora let himself be heard that he supported the NCAA decision, despite adding another item to an already loaded player's diary.
"Three or four days are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
“But nobody gave up, everyone tries. They’re great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to look at clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective net behind the goalbar.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there might be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by security services," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not impossible that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
That kind of material is good for business.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot 8.
We'll use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will be all right.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans a more thorough check of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat the so-called "fake news", stating the largest social network on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will be sent to third parties to verify and potentially display survey results under original posts.
Facebook was referred to as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports affected last year's election of the President of the United States.
Political debates are being debated in Europe, and French voters are flooded with an avalanche of false reports about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a social media fine ahead of the September election if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
On Thursday, Facebook stated in its next statement released in Germany that it was planning to launch testing of a new fake news control feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people demand more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision about what they can share," said Facebook's product news manager Sara Su on her blog.
She added that Facebook continued to test the function of "related articles" and is also working on other changes in order to reduce the number of false messages.
Creating a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeeze group, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy spot near the Bewl River in Kent, Britain, inspiring the curly Jamie Rhodes of York's county - known as a hobby in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"Looking at the handwriting of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me," Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
A graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who resided in the castle of Scotney from the Middle Ages until the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
“This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated with old papers, support from National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to reside in the castle almost as a dream. (To tell the truth, I have extended my stay a bit.").
Rhodes spent time exploring Victorian "new" castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that have been dumped for centuries in the ditch.
He walked around the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talked to gamekeepers, gardeners, and occasionally also artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
He was "drinking whiskey and writing" at night.
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively large unknown, as the National Trust organization did not gain access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as when “the aristocratics of many centuries scatter their hands with the words, ‘Bring it into the attic'."
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: “You may think the land dispute is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and sink deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of a 1380 castle riot called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected in the end."
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, who tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who reportedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after revealing the coffin).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male race — the men of that time were always in debt and spent money on things they could not afford.
Various generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to shake the heads of heirs."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes seeks further adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he sucked inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
For Scotney, however, this is a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now I'm going back to fucking real life'."
Washington changes the terms of the green card award
The media published President Donald Trump's words on the US's new immigration plan, which will also bring about a change in the green card award.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
New rules are proposed by Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers of taxes. We will do so by changing the rules of green card issuing to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will favour English-speaking applicants who abound with funds and demonstrate the capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump said, quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots would appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to the words of former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose eye color, nipple shape and robot nail appearance.
"People make fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often," Sharkey said on the occasion of publishing the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course artificial intelligence, which mimics human behavior.
The user can modify the robot in his image - from eye color and nipple shape to appearance and nail color.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own “personality” that would embarrass even Stepford’s mistress.
Modern inflatable virgins evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement wife various character traits, including shyness.
And then there is the sex robotic woman Roxxxy Gold of True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "adventure" nature.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in the mood.”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - which do not include confusion for real interpersonal relationships. Rather disturbing are inferior female characteristics and violent innuendos - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion resembles Roxxxy to a vibrator for men on its website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have Roxxxy?" it says on the page.
However, sex robots are not simply fetish or sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - moving from ideal or sexual equality towards desire for captivating sex with an optional surcharge.
Of course, most men do not buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the edge of the general public's interest.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women worldwide gain their rights, and there is a president sitting in the White House who is often very derogatory about a woman.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The story of the maid is not what we see - hanged bodies and hollowed out eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
Book draft The story of the maid represents a step in the right direction, but it currently seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (although with porn actress rates).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to touch and to act at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality, ” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing to instigate their independence or disrupt their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
21st century talk: maids.
NBA star on green chives.
Curry fights for cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry is not lost despite a botched first batting at the premier start among professional golfers.
The two-time award winner for NBA's most useful player played the lower-series Web.com Tour at the tournament Ellie Mae Classic in California's Hayward first round on 74 runs and will fight for cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won the second title in the NBA with the Warriors team this season, began very nervously and his first batting ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked near fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left ten professionals behind with a balance of four lashes above the par.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first batting, but then it kind of sat down," Curry said with a huge stage fright.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight through a cut that will probably be set two shots below par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of my stage fright, it might work," said an enthusiastic golfer who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he obtained a sponsorship exception and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The unmistakable sign of Trump’s era is the political divisions that divide American voters, and on a micro scale they also break up entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, it was swarming with advice in American newspapers on how to deal with relatives who vote for Trump.
All we're saying is we're just waiting for them to let go of our nerves.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s family’s ability to unite.
I'm talking about it because my cousin, a poet and a left-wing fan, visited me in New York this week, who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that closeness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings she's been bickering with about politics for years - is on the same page.
At dinner at the family table it's a good thing; but I'm surprised that it poses a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
Speaking of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his clownery may one day lose its attractiveness.
However, there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the epitome of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we had an awareness of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild misdemeanors compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will suffice for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York Park Department - for your three dollars, you won't find a better use, unless you need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the center cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and stare at their own shoulders in horror - completely gloomy sight and tinky music is surprisingly reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama looks at you instead of breathing on you through the atmosphere and the reality of the city is not given to your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't actually Swiss cheese - not counting Ye Olde Swiss Cottage's theme pub - but London Metro Station.
The carousel in Central Park, however, evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the point that two two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, will have a great time on it.
If I could evaluate the carousel, it would deserve maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week, I experienced a similar experience at the store when I was asked to evaluate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying by credit card.
In a cafe on the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can throw 15% tips at the ratings for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to push herself into the favor of shoppers when it's not necessary.
The woman in the store apologized with a smile when I reluctantly assessed my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts on his wrists, which the prison said he caused himself after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original conviction for manslaughter.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of the morning for Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the closet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to re-enlist, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too mild.
National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius threatens to extend his sentence to up to 15 years.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a panda reared in captivity gave birth to a cub that mated in the wilderness.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the panda gene pool kept in captivity.
Chang Zheng Centre's staff told New China that panda farming is at great risk of related crossings.
Only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
Only 2,000 of them survive in the wild.
The effort to mate captive pandas with the wild ones is so the first step to keeping the pandas safe.
Fifteen-year-old Cao-cao was launched into the nature reserve at the beginning of Pandí's mating season on March 11.
Thanks to a tracking device on the neck, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen Cao-cao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male's panda lasted a minute and a half and ended successfully.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal realm.
Males misjudge the time when the female is ready, plus they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even as Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on Greece's territory for illegal camping, comments were cited by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on August 1 in the morning by the Sithonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not permitted.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilk figures after the first round of Major British Open in 50th place.
The course in the Scottish Kingsbarns bypassed the score of one punch under par when she played three birdsie and two bogeys.
Twenty-two-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that on the famous major she will be cut for the first time.
Entry to the $3.25 million subsidy competition was released by the best American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in a 64-shot field record, eight below par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed down 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Netherlands Food Safety Authority reported that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it believes means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk is only a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and poses no danger to adults, but the potential threat is to children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also approached the closure of farms, have not been imported to the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians shall take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland on whose markets problem insecticide brands have emerged.
According to the veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
But there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of flea products, everything, and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss her, says goalkeeper Sedláček and seeks engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe someday I'll go back there," smiled 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in a Zlin jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I were to rate it like school, it'd be three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was studying.
The second year, I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only won five points, so the coaches started shooting it.
By the end, my colleague had caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for the next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who must change their game style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play into the empty.
Less shoots, and even though they have a half-empty wicket in front of them, they prefer to record.
There's more shooting in the Czech Republic after all.
You didn't have a problem traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's no problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly designed to play like four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians even perceive their club at KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it's a national sport.
Everybody's rooting.
Even if it didn't work out, there were a lot of people walking.
Did Dinama's work in KHL help that Latvia almost advanced to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time on, their results at the World Cup began to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading for the Czech Extraliga.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts prevailed and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
How come so many of them come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of engagement?
As early as February, I knew I wasn't going to continue Riga.
That's how we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the final, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín, waiting for something to turn up.
Aren't you nervous?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after a while.
I picked something up at KHL, so I'll take it another way.
The only question is when and where to sign.
How realistic is the possibility that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what happens in a month.
Now all I can do is wait and see what the agent has to say.
Do you prefer a competition?
The passing season wasn't like that for me to choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government fling at Flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in the article With the care of a proper farmer, among other things, about the camp at Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to recall the key passages of the article.
Camp Lety has been spoken of for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it is probably best to take a look at, for example, the official site of the cultural monuments of Pietná instead of Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical survey, they learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of Lety Municipality, that from 8.8. 1940 it served as a work camp, from 1.1. 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2.8. 1942 it became a Gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings that have been caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that these events need to be remembered all the time.
There is no question that this commemoration should take place at the memorial at the site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten and in the 1970s a pig farm was built nearby and on parts of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled at Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but it has not yet.
In 1998, the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much for the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last fall that the government approved the buyout of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably be obstructing those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion comes up with.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price may reach up to a billion.
Either way, it's not gonna be a cheap thing.
Yet only a few hundred metres from the former camp stands a memorial, in which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were financed beautifully by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which is not likely to happen, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Don't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified memorial site, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has occurred, and anyone who wants to can bow to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and let's keep the memorial place as careful as possible.
A responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should handle the care of a proper economy.
At least with one like your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But even so, from the perspective of the above, I see the motto of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May, I went to see the place directly.
Very decent driveway, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camp buildings.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and views of its own memorial site, which is made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as they are and belong to.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, a portion of the exposed foundations could be preserved and made available at least visually in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could strain his efforts.
If he manages to enforce the buyout of a pig for state money in the government, it will just be another unfortunate step in his already problematic activity as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 UK patients causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, patients are reminded not to eat meat and dairy to relieve symptoms, but researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps create immune cells that promote intestinal resistance.
The head of the study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once a bowl of scales leans to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of research, scientists found the presence of immune cells promoting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a connection between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan they had mice in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing turns out to be true of man, then a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, as part of a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of identical mice kept separate cells lacked.
It deduced that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were tested by DNA sorting method and researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing from the second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbiome - they did not develop this kind of immune cells - they were given L. reuteri - and they developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immunity cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the fluid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been detected in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should probably pursue the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signing of the contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be “genial”
Manchester United won a "genium" for his team in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in a Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a £40 million contract, entered in the first match with a win of £2.1 in Dublin - the final preseason match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić was not in shape and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinh, is to be worked on before the next Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent, and has a brilliant mind - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho slowly starts to shape his eleven for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club did a “fantastic job” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me win three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me."
The Life Challenge of the King of Chicken Skins Ládi Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to emerge thanks to a new show on TV Prima Zdenek Academy.
The pear immediately smelled the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy because, hand to heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in a social media video.
And since those two have been on edge for several years, he has not forgotten to irritate Láďa even this time.
"In return, I can teach you nanojuice from dietary chicken meat, American cucumbers or invite you to water and show you why it's favorite fried cheese," Pear.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss says," he said to Lightning.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, Chief!.
Only Prima responded to the participation of Pearka in the culinary academy, considering the whole matter as his personal activity that goes off television.
A big blow was struck by Hruška to Pohlreich in December 2004 by his first cook.
In a few days, she sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new show, presented yesterday by Prima at a press conference on the fall broadcast scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from among the spectators and introduces them to twelve chef techniques in twelve episodes.
In the last episode of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk had his shirt ironed with a crossed pear on his back.
If he had my face in there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'll just smile over that pear - pear is healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ladya responded.
He thinks of Lada's culinary arts.
"To cook according to Ládi Pear is not even an option at home, because I am not going home to the gastropunk," my boss says.
I appreciate Zdenek Pohlreich very much, even making honey chicken according to him.
But his recipes are not going to show up on my show," Pearka did not forgive herself.
He's an asshole!
He's no chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomical analphabet or asshole," Pohlreich said about Hrušek at one lecture.
"I'm not 20 years old to be able to wave my hands at them, but I don't worry about them anymore," he said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock the car and house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip put into his body. With a simple wave of his hand he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and currently offers the same service through his BioTeq company to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure of implantation and compliance with treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats and the whole procedure lasts 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service of replacing door and car locks, compatible with microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
One child’s married father had technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple wave of hand.
White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to the occasion of the celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry held last month came to $24,000 according to Navy records published by TIME weekly.
The Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the highlight of the program of July 17 in the White House, which was a show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials were inspecting a product show from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift trolley from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before landing a helicopter on South Lawn as part of a "exceptional" event, reports Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for administering the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event," wrote HMX-1 commander in an e-mail to his superior, deputy commander of the Air Force the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 on the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled for 3:00 and will remain in place until the complete clean-up of the entire place scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail further stated that if there is a delay in leaving the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew remained on site that evening along with the helicopter and along with them a unit of security personnel.
It was not apparent from the records - retrieved by the weekly TIME - that the second crew was eventually sent.
Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was okay," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander replied.
This show "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President advocated a health reform that went through the Senate and talked about trying to keep government regulations in check.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them to travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential aircraft drove in the background during his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is pleased with the show 'Made in America', which presented products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn area and practice eventual arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the current crew training, said the state official.
The helicopter unit flew the same day as part of the "non-president support missions" for the next eleven hours.
The White House stated that no more props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
Spokesperson Sikorsky stated that the company was in no way involved in negotiations to expose the helicopter to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep accounts of the budget for presidential flights and the exact cost of the show is difficult to determine, according to the Navy's observations.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the 2017 fiscal year, reimbursement of DoD expenditure for VH-3D amounts to $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operational costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"To report taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates shall include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, reimbursement of DoD expenditure does not include personnel costs, but includes fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
Back then, White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of a helicopter for show purposes.
"The Idea parade held this week is to introduce products produced in the USA," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state and that they provide jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities in which countless U.S. citizens are involved.
This fact is to be recalled."
It is unclear if Trump was also looking at a helicopter while on his way to South Lawn. The only thing to be certain is that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump approached a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I own three of my own."
A young woman was stuck in a swamp near Mácha Lake, police were coming to her.
The girl set off to the beach on Sunday around 2:00 in the morning.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the marshes.
When she decided to ask the police for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That is why police officers soon lost contact with her," said police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols set off on the site that she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police had to wade through reed marshes hundreds of meters before they felt the solid ground under their feet again," Baláková said.
And so was the missing person.
The officers were guided by the direction in which her cry for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count down aloud," said the spokesperson.
Cops found a woman at 3:15 in the swamps of Borný.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological forces and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance that was called took her to the Czech Republic hospital.
The old man's connection to the STAN?
The bride-to-be becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project, search engine.cz, it is as if a billionaire is basically telling voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that a politically disparate group of less-known mayors and independents, actually, has no national agenda for the House of Elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after interviewing Grandpa, no matter what political opinion he has.
That's how Vít Bart used to start, and it didn't go very well.
With his quickness to decent people and personalities who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, which Gazdík also admitted, Grandpa also cancels the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and according to surveys.
Now they'll be replaced by a quick collection of unknown personalities.
Total breakup with the People's Party, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained also that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the People's Candidates.
But if only a few suspected STAN of identity at the time, after the arrival of Grandpa the game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long been opposed to YES Andrei Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Grandpa, who publicly praises Babiš, said as follows: "My goal is that the YES movement, the Mayors movement, should gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly not by accident.
He often talks about politics similar to Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been like a reality show for some time rather than a real political party, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to make a desired bride even more of a sales girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the People's Party, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone answers.
Police dogs trained in Most by helicopter
Dogs specialized in explosives search and search dogs today practiced helicopter crossings at Lake Most.
The police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the Ústí Region Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
At the Bridge, both adults trained dogs and those who are still undergoing the training were practicing.
In addition to standard training, in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and look for a missing figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"Helicopter sits down, dog goes and immediately searches," Tomášek said.
The dog, which is restless or on the way by helicopter is unable to immediately start working, is eliminated from training.
"Most of them are kept by dogs in the garden," Tomášek added.
Police have 76 dogs in the Ústí Region with various specializations.
German shepherds prevail, but also Belgian shepherds grow.
The dog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He raises it himself, prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary tests that may reveal possible health disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and unafraid, he takes his first exam at 20 months.
"He gets into a sharp intervention around two and a half to three years," Tommy added.
The length of service with the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve within eight to ten years.
They usually live with their handlers.
Trailer for the 3rd season of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of the Netflix hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer is revealed, the Netflix series is far from ending.
The confirmation from the streaming service has already reached the third and fourth seasons - the first one was named the first trailer and the outline of other negative characters.
In season three, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of the four influential godparents, they operate “as a society from the Fortune 500 rankings,” only with the difference that violent acts are escalating and bribing more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is a cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrer (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcers in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé, and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, have included a representative of the UN in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Auxiliary Mission, said that hundreds of women participate in local council elections, three women applying for the vice presidentship, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored," he said in his Wednesday statement.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate in them, as well as any related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on April 5.
The Taliban released several threats against the electoral process that shifts international combat activity to a second level.
In this year's election, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government passes its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission stated that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, it makes up 1.2 million women.
The unique brewery is re-cooking beer.
To a good beer at the re-resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought back the brewery in Lobč near Mšeno a few years ago.
The brewery mentioned for the first time in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted into an aeromachine operation.
It followed the years of flowering, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beer.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was halted and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, buildings have served the state estate.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was demolished and dismantled into construction material.
In 2007, however, there was a new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began repairing buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves and devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same form as in the nineteenth century when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded with a declaration by the brewery for cultural memory by the Ministry of Culture and the construction also became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, they festively restored the tradition of brewing beer.
To taste the great Lobe beer in the picturesque countryside of Kokořínska, visit the bar in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use the Kokořín water in the protected landscape area, malt from hunting fields and Žatec hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and 1:30.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
This unique building was to be a fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above Babí village.
It was originally intended to form up to twelve bunkers connected by extensive underground.
This was supposed to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition storage, material, power plant, engine room and hospital.
The construction was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is already 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and underground and equipped object of light fortifications, there are two built infantry cabins, trenches and an educational trail of Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshment, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and magnificent Czech building came on the list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Traian port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrudu.
The Chotěšov monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today mainly forms a massive four-winged building of a convent over a beautiful garden.
The list on which it got, but unfortunately it belongs to unique structures that threaten to disappear.
However, the enthusiasts do not want to give up and hold a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year of the evening for the monastery Chotěšov this Saturday, on the fifth of August, where will be performed by Vladimír Mišik, Ivan Voda, you will see fencing performances and look at the places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
A new free Pl@ntNet application will help students with the creation of herbarics and ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they have just come across for a walk, this app will advise them.
All they're going to have to do is photograph the plant, and the app itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new app, available for iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the Center for Ethics and Environmental Education of CEE in Bratislava's Mountain Park as part of the Project Secret Life of the City.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also participated in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French app is available for free download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to contribute as many people as possible to the application with their images, increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who can hold a tablet or cell phone can go into the woods," said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of this project.
Based on a sufficiently high quality photograph of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within seconds, which it assigns under the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project Secret Life of the city.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the application after setting up an account with a snapshot of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial, and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The unions demand assurance from the managers of the McVitie's Biscuits manufacturer about the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
The GMB Union of Scotland has stated that the company is silent for the time being on the potential investment in the Tollcross plant.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies among other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that it had invested over £5 million in the whole area over the past few years.
She added that employees and union representatives would be "among the first informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction executive, GMB's Scottish unions expressed their concerns that McVitie's would "not get their promises of funding and upgrading production lines."
GMB's main organizer Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received clear answers from the contractor about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Generations of many families worked here, and employees mostly come from the local community and Glasgow area, where work at the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, salaries and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising life costs and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer such as McVitie's."
Pladis spokeswoman said: “Tollcross’s supervisor only received a letter from GMB yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we value the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many problems were openly discussed at that meeting.
We have spoken to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and streamlining operations.
We appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the local site, and in case of any changes in the operation of the local factory, employees and union representatives will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar on his side after she has composed £189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the contract, but has this French team warned Barcelona of its record raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred up the water of summer transfers. Ligue 1 Club is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid $89 million for it last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar has made up his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this fact three years ago by PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club that would be interested in overtaking one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona appears to have crossed the imaginary line when she expressed interest in PSG's mid-summer reservist Marc Verratti.
The PSG made it clear that under no circumstances would it allow the departure of an Italian representative, so it is possible that Barcelona now swallows a bitter pill for its bold actions with Neymara’s departure.
Who's gonna explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump said yes to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing about North Korea's threat, and that it wouldn't go on like that.
It also smells the thought of sanctions like shoe straw.
You can't put those things in one bag.
Madura's Venezuela really set out on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not just doing what the US President would like.
Russia is a chapter to itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even a common voter, American, European or other, could understand what he is up to and what rule system the sanctions policy is based on, it would be almost impossible to do so.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely catching up on what President Obama has already prepared, just giving it an Implementing Stamp.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump wins the American election, he would hug Putin and call off sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, but tightened.
But Europe is even scarier.
German Secretary Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
What, that kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then the EU's anti-Russian sanctions are neither kosher.
In turn, European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak they don't put anyone in danger?
Ordinary voter's on the fritz.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Ministries' ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
He is now learning that it is the EU's energy security.
Voter's on the loose.
Russia is being penalized for being too mounted where it is not supposed to be.
China is being squandered for mounting little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these penalties or just reflections have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babiš: I do not consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, cruciates the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, she has finished all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to be led by the Governor of Moravia-Silesian and shadow minister of education YES Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a captain," Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You've upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities alone, with only managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are voting directly for the President, and I am convinced that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about interference, they could be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
In presenting your book, what I dream of, when I happen to be asleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about abolishing the council.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct choice and reducing the number of representatives.
New York with a population of nine million has five districts and 51 deputies.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is accused of building little and not preparing large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, have run in our history.
Which I'm not saying they did it right.
But the current Prime Minister is not running anything, he's just hosting the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
He'd be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
All we have in the program is a one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a slippery mandate for ministers and the regulation of the House's Rules of Procedure to prevent unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are to work mainly in commissions and in committees, not to show off at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That, as a dictator, you will govern the government, control the House with 101 Members, abolish the regions and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and mayors, you will rule the country.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There's nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French for one legislature, while in our country it goes to 17,000 Czechs.
But no one blames Macron for the threat of democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election mostly, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making dramatic changes.
But the seductions for those who have a parliamentary majority are large, just look in Poland or Hungary.
In the case of the YES movement, there is no danger of such a thing.
We just need a team to work for the people in the government, not for their gangs or resorts.
I do not understand, for example, why we have failed to agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services will increase.
Why did I get outvoted and added 21 percent to GIBS members who are already taking 60 grand?
You'd step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agent, and with the money of the state they would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in government, they're supposed to argue outside of the government.
There's no room for coalition disputes, force votes, and business, that's where he's supposed to decide.
How do you plan to have a coherent team when ministers are mostly partial?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition contract did not apply, and fired Babiš from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a person and has control skills, such idle gestures are not needed.
They measure everyone equally and require perfect performance from all of them.
Do you know who you'd propose to be Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't even be in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what the hell I did.
There's not that much skepticism in place.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, with the People's Party, perhaps the wing of the inclined Jiří Čunek will win.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out the coalition with the ANO, in the ODS may be promoted by Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many joint points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the oculars are an option as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr Okamura has his political history, ran as a puppet for Vít Barta for VV, then raised money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
Of course, he's a strong personality.
A little brown though.
When I take his program, he has a broad involvement in the management of society, direct democracy, that's something to agree with.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, speaking at gallows demonstrations and wanting to leave the EU?
We don't consider working with Mr Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in order, but God knows who the winner will be and who the two will be.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government agenda.
Let's get back to your efforts to run the state like a company.
But the government simply has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka allowed everything to go away, never decided.
Coalition issues like CEB or EGAP didn't work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, ČEZ dominated the Czech government.
It is incredible that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by ČEZ management, which imposes on the Finance Minister how to vote at the CEZ General Meeting.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staff conditions on the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm gonna be Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to trade for even better with YES.
Well, maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any Lobbyist Pokor or Pinkie, I'm a separate unit, and I don't care about this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you are in charge of the government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although it is supposed to stand in ČEZ majority, it has never driven it, it was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial matter.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, shove them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to fund and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I have no authority to fire anyone.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay roughly 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how they manage these institutions.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of CT and ČRo.
Look how these reports are being discussed, the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigative files and to the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was stupid enough to let Kalousek push me out of government, which gave me a percentage of TOP 09, but ČSSD took them off.
They're afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, so they're talking about threatening democracy with Babiš.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-president of YES Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power base by putting his son on the Supervisory Board of Teplárny Brno and arranging for a related lawyer Květoslav Hlín to contract with municipal and state firms such as Prague Transport Company or České dráhy?
We have a permanent dispute about that.
I don't like it, and I've blamed him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
Unlike socans, we've never had a corrupt affair, no Pelta, no Kratochvil, no March.
If there was any sign of clientelism in our house, we fired that person immediately.
I'm uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
