Novak helped Trabzonspora to the second place, he also hit Škoda
Defenseman Filip Novák helped with a goal in the final round of the Turkish Football League Trabzonsporu to the title of vice-master.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayserispora field and held the third Besiktas behind.
After the January transfer from Slavia, the attacker Milan Škoda gave the tenth goal for Rigespor, who saved himself, even though he succumbed 1:3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
The rookie confirmed excellent productivity on the defender with a seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute goalkeeper Kayserisporu just fired a rough shot and the Czech footballer pitched the ball from an angle into the net.
The landlords managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the setting dropped the win on his side when he successfully finished the four-to-one breaker.
The damage in the introduction of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after the solo to 1:1.
Although the crisis did not last long, he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of his rivals, he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition will end with Sunday's duel of the master Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa field.
The well-classified cave at the hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was in fact not habitable
There are several sandstone rock formations in the northern Bohemia in the foothills of the Lužické Mountains, near Nový Bor, Českolipsko, in the forests through which the Count's Road led.
Natural and artificial.
And we're going to follow the human hand created.
The place is called the Cave of the hermit.
In fact, however, no hermit ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a hideout chamber apparently on grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rock sharp and accessible up the stairs.
But you can hardly see it until the last minute.
It is revealed up to narrow stairs leading to a rock gallery from which it is just entering the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be far from human dwellings, at the time of formation it may have been on a plateau where there is today a forest, a field.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and even in a traditional location of a heating site clearly shows that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podružek of the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone bench in the back, which apparently serves to put down the containers.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrůžka.
There are traces of instruments on the cave walls.
Slapping the sandstone with a pointer was quite easy and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to make good use of the claws and gradually break the sandstone off.
Depending on the length of the tip mark and the way it is mowed, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the disorder that appears in it, there are sometimes sleepovers there.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are intrigued by a flowing stream under the cave and a nearby count's road, you will surely find the trail down.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be captivated by nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best hands right now.
The Institute is set up for similar cases, and we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly eases my situation and also the care of Finja's daughter," quoted the server Riders.cz by the statement by Minařík's wife Katji.
"Everybody's doing their best, now Philip needs time to recover.
There's no point in giving any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation may change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We must all be patient now and give him time," said the woman of a 45-year-old jockey.
The financial support of the injured Minařík was challenged by both twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes race in Ascot on Saturday, equalizing Lester Piggott's legend.
Almost 70,000 euros were collected at Gofundme server today.
The aim is an amount of €100,000 (CZK 2.6 million).
Videojudge took the footballers Sassuola four goals, losing 0:2
Although Sassuola footballers got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's game in Naples, they eventually had to accept defeat 0:2.
Neither of their goals referee after consulting the video due to offsajdu did.
According to Italian media, this is a record opposition to technology, as many hits as VAR has ever thwarted one team.
"VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him as no team has ever been.
New technology breaks records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a comment.
"Sassuola Unacclaimed Goals Festival.
VAR has never been so strict on one team before," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of the game it seemed that Sassuolo had evened out.
The goal of Filip Djuričič, however, was not recognized after the videojudge's intervention due to the off-said.
For the same reason, no further Djuričich's intervention and the hits of Francesco Caputa and Domenico Berardi were gradually paid.
On the contrary, the landlord added another goal.
The electric cars are reporting a new record.
The most charged in the Czech Republic in history
"The growth has been driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging on public stations, as well as an accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said ČEZ's head of clean technology, Tomáš Chmelík.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, producers of Tesla electric cars, as well as the supermarkets Bill and Lidl, also report their part on the market.
The operator of classic petrol stations is represented by MOL.
She doesn't have numbers yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," Jana Jusková explained.
However, Deník's editors exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric racks operated by ČEZ.
It follows from these that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from stations.
This corresponds to a commute of about a hundred kilometers of smaller electric car.
Apart from small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists had already paid for the purchase, their typical spending was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility stretches mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague are located all five of ČEZ's busiest chargers, which are overshadowed by the popularity of the entire regional towns.
Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the smallest interest is in remote stations in the borderlands, such as Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll of the Diary "Czechs on the Move", eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car into the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their vicinity.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to organizers, the government's actions to date on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a stronger approach.
The event called The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Duha Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people here who have long been opposed to the expansion of the Turów mine, there are people who are opposed to the mining of gravel by the Uhersky Ostroh, there are people who have been opposed to the construction of meaningless dams," Marika Volfová said.
It stated that the main requirements of the protesters were to create a plan for water retention in the countryside, a vigorous change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies towards promoting sustainable agriculture, and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is to defend people's interests, not reckless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostranské náměstí there was a stand with a petition calling on representatives of the Czech state to promote reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and restoration of Czech land and landscape.
The present people were equipped with banners with passwords such as "End of Rape Deps" or "Less of Coal, More Dots".
From southern Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda from the Water Society came for people who protest the plan of mining gravel sand in Hodonínsk.
"He threatens a drinking water source for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned mining of gravel is located only about 500 metres from the wells, and according to the reports, it is certain that the water quality will be compromised.
For so-called agroecological farmers, Vojtěch Veselý arrived from Valeč village in Karlovy Vary.
He pointed out the pros of small farms, which are not married to yields and profits and supply residents on site.
"Small agriecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, they do not do so much damage to the form of rural and environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash on a house in Germany
Three people died today in the fall of an ultralight plane to an apartment building in West Germany, and two others were injured.
Local rescue forces reported this, according to which there are probably two crew members and one resident of the house among the dead.
The aircraft crashed to the roof of a building in the town of Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five housing units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Deputy Chief of Local Firefighters Robert Meyboom reported that both crew members of the aircraft apparently died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The journal Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) referred to Mayor Wesela wrote that she was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a landing brake.
Police assume it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine launched from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
With reference to eyewitnesses, the Rheinische Post reported that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, with reference to other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft had disintegrated in the air before impacting the ground.
Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some payments by card twice on Saturday.
The error has already been removed
On Saturday afternoon, Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged her clients with some card payments twice.
According to bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already removed the mistake and returned the money to its clients.
Problems with double counting of card payments were recorded by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"We did an update of the system yesterday (Saturday) night and immediately returned all these double payments to clients.
At this point everything works without problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to which the bank deducted money from card payments twice, the bank's spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, were smaller thousands of transactions.
The savings bank is finding out the causes of the problems.
"It could have been a combination of more factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, Vojtěch introduces a system of three emergency degrees against coronavirus
"Students will be according to the power of community spread at regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch said in CT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus occurrence.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would currently have orange colour and Prague would be near it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional sanitary stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtech said.
Waterman and Carolina

Most of the disease is mild, only three percent of the infected have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus spreads through the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sunshine significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infectious wards are semi-empty, though the numbers of the infected grow.
"This situation is completely different today and in April and is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," says Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth recalling that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, all of them wore masks, the military carried out the collection, the republic was closed, and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, two people at most die.
The highest number of people infected still has Karvinsko, similar numbers are already in Jihlava due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's centre, where 57 already infected clients and 17 employees are.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienists in Černožice in Kralovehradeck.
The disease confirmed the tests at one of the nurses.
"We're traveling, we've limited movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says the director of the retirement home Martin Schjal.
According to him, none of the clients at home have ever had symptoms of a disease.
The hygienists will start testing the area tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Even hospitals respond to the increased number of infected people.
The Oncological Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people have a mask on their entry.
The record is reported by South Czech hygienists who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of a wealthy company.
Overall, 131 infected - i.e. half of Friday's number - were added for Saturday, but fewer tests are being done on the weekend.
The debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished the story, Anderson was swept away
The great surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh performed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player, which the second most prestigious venture under the PDC won in 2018.
The opening of the match was mutually balanced, the break came at a state of 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh married a black eye with a 13-arrow leg and has since had the upper hand.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and a much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" was hardly able to get to the doubles.
The way "The Creator of Dreams" had him in his pocket is also evidenced by the fact that the disgruntled Anderson played his first best in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian mastered the excellently high checkouts.
He lost last in the eleventh leg, in an unfavorable condition but "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was seen with tremendous frustration.
The darts were more of a throwaway, and his triumph-walking opponent was acting in complete sovereignty.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three match Darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Profit trophies named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to the Belgian darter that it is his first winning major.
It continues to be true that Karel Sedláček is the last player who managed to beat van den Bergha.
There were charges in Nantes over the cathedral fire, the man confessed
The Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Suspects of arson were investigated by investigators because the fire progressed through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no sign of anyone entering the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor has informed that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
In case he is found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his attorney, the man regrets the crime and decides to cooperate fully with the investigators, written by Le Monde.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce "semaphore" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of the pandemic plan, due to the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"The scales will be according to the power of community spread," the minister explained.
He added that nowadays, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the middle, orange grade.
The system is designed as a regional one because the situation in individual regions differs significantly, adding.
On the system, the ministry worked with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be established at individual levels, whether it is an obligation to wear masks or to organise special departments in hospitals.
The Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for an epidemiological plan to be established on the television programme Prima Partie, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized cases remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by saying that nothing essential is happening right now to talk about the announcement of an emergency or the re-invoking of a crisis crew.
In view of the growing number of infected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government again introduced an obligation to wear masks at internal events over 100 people.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now reaching 1000 people.
The government's course of action, when it was not clear until the last minute what measures would apply and when they would start to apply or when they would be announced, was criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and straighten the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilšer in Question.
The measures may already vary according to the region, for example in Prague from Sunday onwards, the obligation to wear drapes in non-resident health establishments, such as in pharmacy or waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear drapes during the visit of medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí Region since Friday.
In Vysočina, Jihlava, it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as in the Central Bohemia Region in Kutnohorsk.
In early June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which colourly distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries, and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to the entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In countries with low and medium risk, authorities have not required Czech citizens to test negative for coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in a low-risk category.
Technoparty in Benešovka continues.
She plays on a third capacity, she was supposed to quit at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty u Hlaváčkova Lhota na Benešovka continues on Sunday evening.
Still playing a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original gross estimates talked about 300, 900 in the morning, said police spokesperson Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time a portion of the music systems actually died down.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production in part still lasts.
We expect that there will be gradually disconnection and disassembly of musical systems," she said.
"Police still consistently control departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breathing test before leaving," she added.
Tens of law enforcement officers oversee the event, there are foreign police, traffic and order police, and there are also dogs with service dogs on call.
"During today's day, police officers checked 470 people moving at the venue of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breathing test, six of which sat behind the steering wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 police drivers tested for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technoparta participants, police officers performed 300 preventive breathing tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't decreased, the police would have intervened.
On the television programme Prima Partie, Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said so.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police evaluated that intervention was not necessary, nor was it requested by a sanitation station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (CT) stated on Sunday that technoparty also extended to surrounding lands, whose owners disagreed with the use for technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim compensation.
The fans of the techno in the meadow at Hlaváček's Lhota arrived on Friday night.
Police originally patrolled the meadow in Blažimi, Benešovska on Friday, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blažim is located approximately 30 kilometres from Hlaváček's Lhota, where the technicians finally got really high.
According to Novak, no one came to Blajimi.
Bite of a Viper: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case of this year was recorded in Železnorudska.
The viper bit a girl in the leg there, the 2010 edition, which was brought by the parents themselves to the rescue service base there," said Diník, regional spokesperson for the medical rescue service Mária Svobodaová, saying that after that they had taken the child to the hospital in Klatovy.
Viper is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and these animals occur in higher numbers in Šumava, so it is good to be careful when walking.
But there is no great danger from these animals.
The odds of being bitten by a viper are not too high, she fears herself in normal contact.
And if she has the space, she likes to crawl away for a loud hissing.
They only attack if they feel very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Even its bite is not a tragedy, though its poison is very effective against small mammals, it will not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from an allergy.
Thus, the risk of danger is particularly in children, seniors, and allergies.
"Man often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea after the bite," said Miriam Gredová of Klatov Hospital.
A man threatened to throw an infant out the window.
The cop was pouring wine and throwing dishes.
After 11:00 p.m., a task force broke into the apartment and detained the man.
Infants were immediately taken into care by paramedics, reported in a press release a spokesperson for the Regional Police Markéta Janovská.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, throwing dishes, knives, or pouring wine from the window after the police negotiator.
He increased his threats several times during negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
One day, he even climbed up the windowsill where he swerved.
The police continue to investigate the man.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosurová prefers to a daughter over a tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not hit the coronavirus affected by the season this year.
Thirty-six-year-old US Open 2011 champion who became a mother in June, but still doesn't want to end her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that his family and daughter will enjoy tennis even more than they used to.
Stosur announced two weeks ago on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to Genevieve's daughter in mid-June.
"I'll stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little milestones our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one in four on the Australian Union website said.
The WTA Tour will resume the discontinued season on August 3 with an ancient tournament in Palermo as of March.
Sapa Market: Razie revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, additionally under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be destroyed in the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the live fish stand, it was then discovered that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last fall, vets discovered an illegal grocery store, with nearly half a ton of unmarked foods without proof of origin in it.
For most, it was impossible to determine the date of consumption, part of the products had a expired shelf life and was corrupt.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the date of durability was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, with a portion of which was moldy.
Putin telephoned the Greens before the Donbas ceasefire began, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenský about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is due to begin starting at midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin's statement, criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
New ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is to start after midnight at night on Monday, it is to be "complete and general" and it is to open the way to fulfilling other provisions of peace agreements.
Putin said in an interview to Zelenski that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to hold local elections contradicts the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens the prospect of settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Parliament last week decided that the upcoming local council elections would not take place on the territory ruled by pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
According to Unian, the Green Office said that both statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming Donbas ceasefire, as well as on the need to implement further measures to promote peace in this region, such as mine off areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied Crimea peninsula, and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement helped to stop fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in occasional shootouts and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in negotiations has not yet occurred.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, the seven-fight was taken over by Novotná
The defense attorney of the last two titles Doležal did not finish Saturday's programme of the 400th century, Kopecký did not jump the foundation in the pole on Sunday.
Ten battles have long been ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who prepares in the group of coach Josef Karas, but has resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor MČR so far, this time he was the only decathlonr to reach the 7,000th border.
Other medals were awarded by William Stránský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of both Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a shame there weren't boys and Kope here, 'cause that would make the results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I appreciate the fact that I had a personal one 30 centimeters away.
Then I was pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed with the disk, there I was below average," he acknowledged on the association Facebook.
On the first day of the seven-fight, Katerina Cachová won with more than a hundred-point superiority, despite being tormented by an injured ankle on a rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she then enrolled only 570 cm, did not switch the spear 40 metres, and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points before Kateřina Dvořáková.
It came mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around those 630s.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I am so glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on union Facebook.
Bio LPG arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
The favourite is especially for its substantially lower price than gasoline or diesel, given significantly lower excise duty, but its benefits are also in lower CO2 emissions per mile.
Like petrol and diesel, it has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite new - the European market first appeared a year ago and according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association arrived several days ago.
"These days we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed in a blend with classic fossil LPG to our gas stations," says Jiří Karlík of Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the Association, chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which a number of motorists are fueling into their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference compared to classical LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, Chairman of the Association, on bio LPG.
This also refers to one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food and sugar cane residues.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
By contrast, classical petroleum LPG is partly produced as a by-product in the refining of oil, partly by separation in the extraction of natural gas.
Consequently, depending on the production technology and the source of the bio LPG car operation, 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the oil LPG operation and up to 90% more environmentally friendly compared to diesel.
However, it is not the CO2 emissions from the car exhaust, but the ecology of the fuel production, i.e. the "well-to-tank" part (Czech "source to tank").
Some of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG currently include Petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also explores the possibility of production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to estimates by the Association in the Czech Republic, about 170,000 vehicles run on LPG; the Ministry of Environment states a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, approximately 200,000.
According to statistics by the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered cars were converted only last year.
LPG can be refuelled in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtech revised the number of infected, number dropped by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers infected with coronavirus virus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon dropped from Saturday 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 fewer infected.
At present, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump increase in the number of cured is a revision of data, which recently the hygienists have been unable to update," said the head of health statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people contracted coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 recovered and 371 diseases of Covid-19 unfortunately succumbed.
Mobile Election Units or Correspondence Choice.
Politologist and sociologist sought variants for the time of pandemic
According to Vice Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), there is a need to change the law to allow people in quarantine in October's regional and Senate elections because of the coronavirus.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday at the Prima Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral bill," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find solutions within the applicable legal rules.
However, the minister stated that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated on OVM that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for a vote abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of YES or ČSSD (because, according to experience abroad, it would rather record it to other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overestimated.
Personally, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (choices) that could be implemented this year and with the least possible health risk.
He then considers the main one to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (whether only abroad or in the Czech Republic) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As another, he sees the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - the Coronavirus elections - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus disease, different types of elections in 67 countries of the world have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Buharsk: Pig ears threw protesters at government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
This was another of a series of protests against the "mafionic style of governance" that has been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers plan for the Wednesday national blockade, reported by the DPA agency.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Radio Freedom had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
Around 300 people gathered at 20:00, some streets had to be closed for transportation.
The protesters in front of the government's building performed a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Gesev into prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
Resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The protest organizer Nikolai Hadjigenov stated today on public radio that on Wednesday there is going to be a "top escalation" in the form of "national manifestations in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He repeated the demand for Boris's and his government's resignation, as well as the announcement of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had previously announced that he was not going to resign.
He justified this, inter alia, by the need to implement the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he traded five members of his government team, though he did not calm down the concessions of the protesters.
At the beginning of this week, Borisov's government overcame a vote of confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovich no longer wants games without the spectators
The football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlovich has had enough Italian League games without viewers.
The Serbian coach hopes that since the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're running here right now is not football.
I'm tired of fighting without the spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, it doesn't make me happy.
The fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so," Mihajlovich said before today's match against Lecce.
Coronavirus pauses are followed by series A matches in rapid succession, and although they are played in the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
Under such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are.
I wish this season would be over.
The measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September," said the coach who led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovich, this season is also extraordinary because four months on the bench were missing due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the league's interruption and everything else, our team managed to move the level up.
We want to continue to grow and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of the cyberattack of foreign states, claims Iran
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have reported that the fire that erupted this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz may have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musawi told journalists according to Iranian media that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks every day".
He added that it was not a new phenomenon and that most of them manage to bounce off.
In recent months, according to Musavi, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, behind which "certain governments and groups" were, according to analyses, behind them.
According to Reuters, however, he did not disclose more details about possible perpetrators.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries, and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's IRNA state agency this month discussed the possibility that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, could have been behind recent incidents.
None of these countries, however, were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tense relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and introduced sanctions against Iran that have a hard impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. Army killed Iranian General Kasem Solejmán and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
Iran then fired a number of missiles on the bases in Iraq on January 8, where Americans operate.
The U.S. only in hindsight admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran its archenemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is attempting to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended production shutdown, now until 25 May
The Kolín automaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) renewed production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday, May 25 in the morning.
The start will be accompanied by dozens of sanitary measures, said automaker spokesman Tomáš Paroubek.
Production has been due to coronavirus pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
Originally, the company intended to restore it on Monday 18 May.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the shutdown extension is closed borders and closed dealership, so cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. for two shifts.
Coronavirus is affected by key markets of the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom, or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kashpar (Change for Cologne) said that the shutdown of production in TPCA is not signed on life in the city.
"At the beginning it was known, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it got really loose.
So the city is full," Kashpar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed at the dormitories.
"We haven't had to solve a problem in two months," Kashpar said.
For example, the Mladá Boleslav Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, restored it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither of the plants works at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in the Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third, i.e. night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the production was restored.
About 2500 people currently work in TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to the family
For more than two years, she struggled with the insidious cancer of Gemma Sisson, and when it seemed that she had defeated cancer, the disease resounded.
A 36 - year - old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a hospital bed, where she could still marry her life’s love.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook social media account for the loved ones.
Gemma Sisson, from English Leeds, loved bodybuilding.
With her friend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, they traveled around the world in competitions.
A 36 - year - old woman sported and lived healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to have managed to win over cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
According to information from the British daily Daily Mirror, a bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery and then began again with drastic treatment.
Of course, everything was in vain.
Early this year, on her thirty-nineth birthday, doctors informed her that she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, a handsome blonde decided to join the Leeds hospice, where her family visited her all the time, which even arranged her wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for the last time for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after she died, a post appeared on her social media account that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this has been published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart for leaving my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who was by my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, saying that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social media followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should value their life and live it to the full.
Art machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, passers-by will receive a pocketwork from most beginning Czech artists.
Images and other creations are created directly for artema, so they know in advance that they have to fit into a magnitude of 8.5 at 5.5 centimetres.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text in the package about the artist and then the work itself," Petra Widžová specified.
Artmat works with the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can thus be surprised at the artwork he acquires.
Currently, he can become the new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventur, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutkova prepared a pexeso associated with walking in Prague.
The cards need to be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell a pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the troudnac and fortune-telling cards, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritist.
Health pay will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
The larger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtech
The health pay could increase by no more than five percent in the next year, said Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) at Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
The unionists' demand for an increase of up to 15 percent considers it unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in securing protective aids.
According to him, hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase in (pays) may be somewhere up to five percent," said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when, from March, the insurance pandemic of coronavirus and government regulations against its spread have intervened in the selection of the insurance pandemic.
The income of insurance companies decreased at the time.
"I find the increase of 15 percent unreal at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly income of a physician in acute bed care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) is likely to reach CZK 88 312 this year, sisters 47 498 CZK.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the wages of other founders will be up to 7,000 crowns.
The IHIS data also indicate that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 according to data from the Czech Statistical Office in 2019.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be followed by salary tables, and contract wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private.
They therefore also require that health professionals be united in the tables.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to 7,000 crowns per month.
For example, in doctors, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to the President of the Czech Stomatological Chamber Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive the state at present.
Recently, due to the effects of the Covid epidemic, the House approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record of CZK 500 billion, of which CZK 1.75 billion is due to be paid to health care professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers, according to Šmucler, disagrees with the salary increase in the next year.
According to him, pay should be decided by the hospitals themselves and health establishments, and the extra money should go to them through a payment decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The Chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any protective health aid.
He's waiting to complete the tenders.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now better able to supply goods than in March when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
A scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they say
"Smart quarantine works, it's something to improve, of course.
We're gonna discuss this with the Army tonight.
The army works perfectly, and it is a question of whether they should not manage the whole thing again," said the Prime Minister on Sunday on his Facebook show Hey people.
According to him, IT systems and sanitary stations are not sufficiently connected, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the prime minister in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Minister of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek said for CTK that he does not have information about Sunday's negotiations and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this move, according to him.
The Smart Quarantine Project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, a clever quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team formed under the military as an advisory body of the government, led by former minister's Deputy Roman Prymula.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticized the scrubbing project on Sunday.
He also suggested that the army could take him back.
Inadequacies in the project were previously admitted by the government's IT and digitization agent Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
"The system works, but it's still working.
For 20 years, it's been self-contained and unsystematic, now we're trying to unite in a few months.
It's not going through the nozzle.
People as they go, poor people in hygiene as they go, adapt the new systems and actually pick up the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won't run again because he doesn't want to "goof around in politics"
The current Ostrava Mayor Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "do not go crazy in politics," he told the server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO Bureau, has been Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal election, he won almost a third of the electoral votes of the ANO movement in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I could hold on to one term, and with my experience in business, I could turn everything around and get on my feet," he said to Respect.
He added that for the second term, he allowed himself to be persuaded to some extent.
"But for me, it's as good as it gets.
I don't want to fool around with the politics," said Macura, who called himself a heavy introvert in an interview that does not suit frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, it has been speculated for a long time about Macura's possible end in the YES movement.
The server recalls that Macura criticized the YES movement several times, for example for alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few ANO figures, Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš supported the election.
From the ANO movement he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel like I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is coughing in it, I have no immediate motive to end it," he said to Respect.
Sixty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as, among other things, director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat in the organs of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
Uber will return to Brno in late July, offering transport services.
It is a consequence of the change of the law, said Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) in a press statement by Brno Councillor for Transport on Thursday.
The taxi drivers objected against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as the designation as taxi or tax meter.
However, by changing the law, the conditions for operating common taxis and alternative taxis have changed since July.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is the result of the amendment of the law allowing this company to operate legally.
The city was informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
He was protested by taxi drivers over not marking vehicles as taxis or missing taximeters.
The court issued a preliminary measure that banned Ubera from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could ride in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
They will now return on the basis of a change of law.
As of July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a meter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too luxuriant celebration in Brno: the flying chair fell a meter from the man on the sidewalk
The office chair flew out from the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday night in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
At that point, a pedestrian came after him, who immediately called the officers.
On arriving at that address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window under which the chairs and several cans and butts still lay.
"The ear, which was carried from the room on the fourth floor, hinted that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers went out in the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men present, aged 26 to 29, for an explanation," said officer spokesman Jakub Ghan.
The request to appeal Rafaj will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with coalition social democrats a request for the appeal of the head of the Antitrust Office (ÚOHS) of Petr Rafaj on Monday.
To appeal Rafaj, nonprofit organizations called on the government's anti-corruption council and also the Ustecký Region to act.
Social Democrats say that the exchange at the head of office is in place.
According to the information of ČTK Rafaj, he was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
The second mandate will expire in the middle of the next year, he cannot be appointed for the third time under the law.
His appeal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of nonprofit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is to include Rafaj's recent cases.
In the past week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would become acquainted with the materials and the government parties would take a "some position on it".
He also stated that he had not yet negotiated the challenges with the President, he did not have an appointment with him in the near future.
According to the ÚOHS statement for appeal, there is no reason because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz have written in the past week that police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Governor Jiří Čunk.
The meetings linked, among other things, to the decision-making of the project of the controversial new Zlin hospital for eight billion, which Čunek strongly advocates.
Chunk admitted the meetings, according to him they jointly dealt with his "seat activities".
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústecký Region's representative challenged the government at the end of June to dismiss Rafa.
It also asks for a reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the ÚOHS regarding public procurement according to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has the characteristics of a volley.
Last March, police intervened in an antitrust office due to a tender to choose a myth.
This June, the server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written on the company of influential behind-the-scenes player Alexandr Čuba.
An advance of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
The Chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition has been Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for a second term the President appointed a former Member of Social Democracy in June 2015.
In less than a year, the Rafajs will expire their second six-year mandate.
The Antitrust Office Act states that the President may withdraw the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it has not served for more than six months, or seriously undermines the dignity of its function or independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blanese library, employees collapsed in heat.
Air Conditioning Helps
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children, we go to the library in central Blansko regularly.
In warm months, however, it was virtually impossible to endure.
It was so hot and bad air.
The ventilation didn't help.
That's why I like the air conditioning," said one of the blank readers Petr Novotný.
According to the library director of Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often went up to 30 degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it acts as a greenhouse.
"In addition, the sun leans into it due to the curvature of the building much of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem for individual departments to ventilate, because the window must be closed overnight for security reasons.
We often have this since morning in the library to 30 degrees," said Dlapa.
The worst part was the study room and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs, the exhibition room and the principal's office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward, located under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes Librarians at work collapsed and ended up in incapacity for work.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes it was impossible to breathe there," said Dlapa.
Originally, city representatives wanted to do air conditioning in all the library premises this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most problematic spaces.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department are upstairs," said Jiří Svoboda of the Blanken Investment Department.
He added that, in the first phase, workers already installed air conditioning into the said premises last fall and modified the wiring.
About 360,000 crowns.
The Blansko City Library has nearly 3,000 registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
The curtain of Chicago has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford returns to the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who are silent about the health of players as a grave and do not disclose anything at all.
As one of the few, he stepped out of the Crawford line.
A 35-year-old native from Montréal was only present at the first training, since missing in the lineup.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and because of this I have spent the last two weeks locked up in my house," he revealed the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his condition anymore.
Crawford's ready to take on the full load again.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalkeeper won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goal range is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks await first a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then will be in the foreground facing Edmonton.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several locations protested unemployment, corruption, and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tackles the coronavirus crisis.
Manifestos took place, among other things, before Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahu due to a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as how the government tackles another wave of coronavirus epidemics.
"Bibi, go home," AP said one of the protesters on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's widely known nickname.
"Everyone sees the Emperor has lost his clothes," it said on another.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is the first Prime Minister of Israel to be tried in the performance of his duties.
He is accused in three counts of corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust.
He rejects all charges and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial may take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses being summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was confirmed in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, with nearly 60.500 people.
455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce the daily increases of the infected.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, however, in particular, in late June, the numbers of infected again began to grow significantly.
Netanyahu's critics claim that the government did not help enough, for example, traders affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also concerned that the government issues conflicting guidelines as part of the fight against coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body must have been cut from the wreck by the fire department.
A tragic accident occurred around 23 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapa Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the forest at a considerable speed and smashed the car by a tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to be released from the wreck by firefighters, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are investigated by police officers.
They ordered a judicial autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether a man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and embarks on a major change of strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to spout one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the greatest polluters of the environment is not news.
Thus, billions of clothes end each year in incinerators and landfills.
The view of slow fashion, often a despised approach to clothing, has changed quite quickly over the last few years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to the discounts, is not easily purchased.
The company does not want to spew one collection after another and at the end of each season, the products are discounted below their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and blind follow-up of fast-changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most discount traders already count on buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a scam," says the owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
Moreover, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing which is timeless and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the premium brand segment is typical of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," Mička adds.
Giant graffiti presents RAF flier Kurt Taussig
"The entry was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The design liked the city's leadership," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He used about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton’s organization, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig made it to Great Britain, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in African South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined combat operations early in 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known by people in the street graphic arts industry under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the warm streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on surfaces that were earmarked for these purposes by then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna arrived on the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight SELČ for today) on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas.
He struck Texas Island Padre Island, approximately 24 kilometres (24 km) north of Port Mansfield, and weakened into a tropical storm as he moved over the mainland.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, according to the AP agency, electricity outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott already announced a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwestern Texas on Saturday and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given by people from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and the Bay of Mesquite Bay, but the element is supposed to hit the territory nearly 500 kilometres long before it gradually moves over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, surface rises, dangerous surf, and isolated tornadoes pose a threat," the U.S. National Center for Hurricanes (NHC) warned.
This morning the local time (afternoon SELČ) storm moved in the area of the American-Mexican border and was accompanied by wind at a speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by a wind of up to 145 kilometres per hour, but as it progressed to land, it gradually weakened up to 112 kilometres per hour, eliminating Hanna from the hurricane category again.
The authorities called on local residents to survive the storm at home while not forgetting the hygiene measures involved in preventing the spread of coronavirus.
Texas belongs to those U.S. states that the pandemic of covid-19 disease plagues the most.
Due to existing security measures and the need to maintain distances, evacuations are also a major challenge.
The makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Hidalgo district of Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as shelter after evacuated, who had a positive coronavirus test or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to hide, if possible.
"We haven't even been through it yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," said AP Agency Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
Forecasts claim that in some places it could rain up to 300 millimetres of rain within a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which together with the swelling of sea level could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman lends the general rank to Colonel Lipk
President Miloš Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipk on Wednesday.
This is based on an overview of the Ministry of Defence's expected events.
The reason for lending the rank of brigadier general is the August arrival of Lipka on the post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Multinational Division of the Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as Deputy Commander of the Czech Army's Land Forces.
The promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
As of early August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl Řehka in the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division of the Northeast in Elblag, Poland, commanding the units of the Alliance's forward presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltic.
Řehka became director of the National Office for Cyber Security and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The government suggested to the president that Lipko lend the rank of Brigadier General.
Under the Law on Soldiers of the Occupation, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the duration of the elected post or for the duration of the service assignment required by the higher rank lending.
The post of deputy commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the general rank.
A soldier to whom the rank has been loaned has the same rights and duties as if he were appointed to that rank.
However, he does not qualify for a salary adjustment that corresponds to a given rank.
The rank loan lasts until the lapse of the reason for which it was granted to him.
"Colonel Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
He is significantly involved in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and security of the military's participation in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. in Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the distance or wearing masks on the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to remain vacant.
Reuters reported it.
"I am glad that my colleagues adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we were able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that officials had concluded the agreement and that it still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover your mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during safety checks and check-in at the airport.
There must be plenty of fresh air on aircraft, and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by officials meet at least some of the requirements of airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
On the Arctic Spitsbergers, a temperature record fell, they measured almost 22 degrees
"In Longyearbyen, a 41-year-old record fell," the Norwegian Weather Institute reported on Twitter.
On the evening there the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, thus breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, added.
Roughly 2,000 Longyearbyen is the largest city on Spicberky, located about 1300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Spicybers heat faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the danger arising from warming in other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, is reported in last year's report by the Norwegian Center for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature on Spicberky has increased from the 1970s by three to five degrees.
By 2100, it may even rise ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere do not decrease.
Temperature growth can result in melting of ever-frozen soil in Spicbergs, endangering the stability of many buildings, roads, or airports, and can also cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, who depend on the ocean’s ice cover.
The British who return from Spain await mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain that were not necessary due to the risk of spreading the disease covid-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people must be isolated for two weeks.
New rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have adopted this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list," she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement hits the travel plans of thousands of British.
Spain is one of the very popular holiday destinations.
The British are concerned, among other things, whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne booked a 10-day vacation on Lanzarote, scheduled to leave on Tuesday.
The trip has been ordered since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as an engineer, and I don't think my employer will agree to be quarantined for two weeks on my vacation," said Metro Hunter.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of epidemics.
In the last two days, over 900 newly infected have been added there every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia, to limit all nightlife and to prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently drawn attention to the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the region of Madrid.
The Dukovan electricity purchase model will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss the model of the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill foresees that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated portion of the final electricity price for customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have already stated that the more likely option is that people will save thanks to the construction for electricity.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The intention had been criticized by environmental organisations before.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the material documentation.
Havlíček stated in May that he assumed that the wholesale price of electricity would increase and the people at the construction of Dukovan would earn.
Otherwise, the impact in tens of crowns per year on the family, which he believes is far less than people pay in electricity invoices annually to support the so-called supported resources.
He had already estimated that the purchase price could range between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The material presented does not contain any draft amount, it is to be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, at which traders are now most stocked, currently amounts to around €45 (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity of €10, the average household could make a surcharge with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-member households, standardly equipped with electric appliances including electric hobs and ovens, which does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - less than CZK 100/year," the MIT government said.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be a highly speculative issue," said Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group.
The proposed law assumes that the purchase would be carried out by the MIT or by a legal entity owned by it at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even by repeated, but no longer until the closure of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines electricity production as a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity of a minimum power output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity annually, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into service in 2036.
The model of funding the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the State on an interest-free basis, with 2% of the interest calculated on the basis of the operation.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, and it also resents the possibility that the Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš said in May that the expected amount for building the block at current prices is approximately €6 billion (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the state and ČEZ on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development withdrew the media-support material for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry for Local Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns on the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic, withdrew the office from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (behind YES) server ListZprávy.cz said the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was notified on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry justified the plan by the decline of tourism due to coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a decline in income.
The proposal sparked criticism of the opposition and representatives of tourism.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the hlidacstatu.cz website, MMR planned to give money through the state tourism agency CzechTourism for advertising in televisions, radios, press, Internet, billboards or railway stations.
The largest share of money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most of it would be acquired by private televisions Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weekly newspapers would get 400 million, and the same episode would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be a private station again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or in metros.
The tourism campaign in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and take a year.
"The material is still being worked on, certainly not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová said without further details of the ListNews server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to TOP 09 head Markéta Pekarová Adamová would profit media from advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this pretentious contempt will be struck between the eyes in the fall of the election," she tweeted.
Dotálová rejects that this is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she said on Friday, Diary N.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
Initially, saving tourism makes no sense to the media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a useless advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Life broth, cock beer and death like a blade of grass
The third album, titled A Death, is also posthumous, is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who left also a year ago, on 24 May.
In Frič's discography, it is the fifth item and, like previous titles, the main emphasis is on Frič's poetry, which he himself is an excellent performer.
Frič, in 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but he passed this inspiration through his own, distinctive experiences and also very inner expressions of faith.
Of course, he was far removed from any agitation, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradíček), the masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers records of authorial reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians, who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was violocelist Josef Key or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help - I would like - in the words of Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetry compositions.
"They were filled with proud and unending bitterness," Pearka writes, "over the state of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which increasingly sinks into dull consumer vanity and greed, is getting further away from what his soul was made of - the secrets of faith, humility, and human proximity.
In them the homesickness of one who knows that the values for which he was created is of little concern to anyone, but who also knows that only because of the general lack of interest can they not be renounced.
The poems reminded us that one may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how it will be lost.
If he sells himself to general decline, he will sceptically resign, silence, or remain calm and proud of what he believes and loves until the last minute."
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamáček said
Former Prime Minister and ČSSD Chairman Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The party's chairman and interior minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Ham's said it today on the TV show Prima Partie.
Paroubek should be a Hamáček advisor on Friday he informed the server ListZprávy.cz.
"We write a text from time to time, he sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added, however, that this was not official and paid cooperation.
According to the ČSSD, it does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I occasionally read his opinion is a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "uncoverably listen to the views of Václav Klaus".
He believes that this is okay because it is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is making it an affair as a sign of this year's cucumber season.
Server ListZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek performs the role of Hamas' unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that Peter Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as Vice-President of his LEV 21 party, headed for the fourth place of the party candidate in the region of Ústí.
Hamáček said today that the composition of the candidate would not comment until it was finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile's head start, it's a kick in the ass, laments the Swede's challenger
The 22-year-old American sticker has ambitions and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like two years younger Duplantis to beat, last year he was overwhelmed by the NCAA University Association meeting.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good fight," Nilsen describes, who secured the victory with a power of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since fired a steeply upward shot and is currently alone in the highest bars.
In only twenty years he became a world record player, this year on 8 February in Toruni he surpassed a bar of 6.17 metres, a week later in Glasgow he added an inch.
"He jumped six metres at the age of 18 when he finished high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from boy to man, he would multiply all his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he believes.
Even if Nilsen's list of achievements is thinner than the one he prides himself on, the American sets similar goals.
He indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, this February he improved one of them's internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Panamanian Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought his way into the U.S. quest for the World Championship, where he finished 13.
The nearest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It is definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much in the Diamond League as possible, because there you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead as well at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan-American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and the other bars time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere silver fight?
"Everybody tries to catch up with him, but I don't think it'll be possible any time soon," Nilsen considers.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years, and in training, he's got a mile's head start over everyone else."
And by the time Tokyo starts 2021, he's going to want to raise it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of invalid retirements on an infirm son.
She's in for a trial.
The money a 33 - year - old man receives from the state as an invalidity pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman is facing up to eight years in prison.
Because of poor health, the court stripped a sick man of his rightfulness, and appointed his mother as a guardian to manage, among other things, his son’s money.
"Women from mid-November 2013 to January this year used part of their son's invalidity pension funds for their needs, thus costing him CZK 440,000," police spokesperson Dana Ladman said, adding that the accused woman was making it worse for her to have a special obligation as a guardian to defend the interests of the victim.
Although a woman had set up an account for her son as instructed by the court, she had his pension sent to her bank account.
"After paying the costs associated with a son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary drugs, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electrical appliances and run a household," the prosecution says.
That he can't use his son's money for his own good, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for family expenses.
"We had problems with our income to tighten the running of the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things whose purchase the son would approve.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, says scientists after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spear or spear spikes.
Scientists found that the oldest of the instruments came from between 33,000 and 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of the State of Zacatecas and the lead author of one of the two studies that were published on the subject in Nature magazine.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years of age.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a large altitude, has been inhabited for 20,000 years.
So far, widely recognized theories have spoken of the first representatives of the Homo sapiens crossing the mainland bridge from the area of today’s Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spikes of spears used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this clavian culture subsequently spread in much of North America.
However, this model has received cracks in recent decades when several ancient settlements, two to three thousand years older, were discovered.
In a second study published in Nature magazine, 42 different locations throughout North America are reported to prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to North American mainland sooner than expected.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovian culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, on her new findings.
The interest in tickets so far fills the optimistic scenario, claims sellers.
Prices are decreasing gradually, too
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic grow every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still roughly half that, but demand grows by up to 20 percent every week.
According to sellers, post-crisis developments thus fulfill the most optimistic scenarios.
Flight prices are gradually decreasing as well.
According to retailers, the most sought-after destinations are mainly southern European states.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy, and Greece lead.
At Letuška.cz portal, flights to Croatian Split are the most sold.
From other countries, the UK is the most sought-after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also reduced.
At Letuška.cz portal it moved around CZK 6250 in the middle of the month, 3000 in yoy.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices are also falling to some European places, such as Spain or Italy in recent weeks, have fallen by about a fifth.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets much less ahead than before, as they are concerned about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information, Kiwi.com bought the flight time by approximately ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend when people will order tickets in much less advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, vice president for Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Together with the growth of sales, the number of renewed air lines from the Czech Republic is increasing.
At Prague airport there are currently regular lines to more than 60 destinations.
It is about half of the destinations against last summer's season.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darter battle live at Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has walked to the grand finale.
It features experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and a surprise tournament, a 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson eliminated Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the spreadsheet.
Even with James Wade, however, he dealt with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home World One in the quarter-finals.
"Flying Scotsman" had a close-up in the semi-finals when he faced Michaele Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, in overtime dominated and after the outcome of 18:16 he won a place in the tournament finals, which he dominated as early as 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensura Suljovich 21:19.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darter first surprisingly eliminated Nathan Aspinall's world six, overpowered Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and defeated Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp onset.
The big check was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained an excellent series of lead, which he then kept more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, by which he hit the occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased since at least the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has demonstrably infected 15 212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are ill.
This is based on data on the Ministry of Health website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases in this week exceeded four times in a row by two hundred.
Maxim was Friday's 281 cases.
Thursday was positive 235 tested, a day earlier 246 and on Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 were infected.
From covid-19, 9,590 people have already been cured in the Czech Republic, 63 percent of all so far infected.
Most of the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 patients with coronavirus, 19 of whom are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, per 100,000 inhabitants, is still showing Karvinsko, almost 59.
This is followed by Jihlava County with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected in the Czech Republic, new measures have been in force since Saturday against the spread of coronavirus.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events over 100 people, it is cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will then be reduced from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have demonstrably contracted a new coronavirus has already crossed the 16 million threshold.
According to the American University of Johns Hopkins, which follows the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died with covid-19 disease is close to 645 thousand.
The most recent million infected have been added to statistics in just three days; the 15 million border fell on July 22.
In recent days, the United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, have had the largest share of rapid growth in cases where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, according to authorities.
The infected are now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that there were more than 284 thousand new cases worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the onset of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous states such as the US, Brazil, and India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in nearly 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case has been officially announced by the DPRK today.
The air in the homes is up to five times worse than the outdoors.
Health is bad for air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in the outdoors, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for the creation of Israel’s Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is important to focus on household harmfuls right now when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) judges that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still forced to work from home, people must spend more hours in homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households," said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one deals with the quality of "home air."
At the same time, things that a person normally comes into contact with can be dangerous - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas is also issued by clothing that we regularly wear to the cleaners," said Abraham.
According to her, children, old household members, and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headache, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleed, vomiting or skin allergy.
In long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, the internal organs and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all harmfuls come from objects inside households, but the material from which houses are built can also be a source.
The Václav Havel Quiz: How long did he spend in prison and what made him write the Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost its chance to advance to the highest Spanish Football League due to coronavirus infection on the team.
The lead of the competition originally cancelled the postponed duel of the last round of the Second League, in which the team could secure participation in the playoff.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests to covid-19 at the club up to 28.
Due to the disease on the team, a Monday duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada was enough a point to get into the playoffs.
The competition management said today that the duel against La Coruni definitively appealed in view of the higher power because there was no longer a chance to play it.
Fuenlabrad took the decision.
Against the non-playing of the match, La Coruna rebels.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save her, but she considers it unfair that the last round did not play out according to the practice complete in a uniform term.
The leadership of the former elite Spanish club threatens to be court-martialed due to the fall into the third league.
The first two teams of Huesca and Cadiz tables have a certain advance between the elite.
About the remaining third forward spot with in the playoff clash Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter revealed it.
"Daddy didn't have to have him for many years," she revealed for Aha! the eldest daughter of Gott Dominik, saying that Master could not come to Havel's name and whenever he came up with it, it always upset Karl.
It's hard to tell what they did, but Dominica said the dispute started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"My father said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in a drawer at the time of the dark, but if he had resisted in any way, he had an end to his career," says Gott.
Next, however, he adds that the Czech greats eventually found their way to one another.
"I know Havel couldn't hear the word until he was 60.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter for his birthday and suddenly Dad's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
After all, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his seventyth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Dad then regularly invited Mr. Havel home to Bertramk," added a blonde whose father died last October.
The nightingale was also said to have regretted that he had never received the state honours from Václav Havel.
After all, he received it in 2009, although it was already from the hands of his successor in the office of Václav Klaus (79).
Another tribute will be in memoriam, for the current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to grant him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
