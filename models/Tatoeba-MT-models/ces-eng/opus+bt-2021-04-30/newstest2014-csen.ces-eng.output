Black box in your car?
While American road designers are working hard to find money to repair a crumbling highway network, many begin to see solutions in a small black box that easily fits into your car's dashboard.
Devices that track every mile the motorist runs away and which transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of Washington and the state planning authorities' controversial efforts to renovate the outdated system of funding America's major roads.
Usually the flimsy design of highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed for the government to use these small lockers that would record miles and possibly where you are going – and then that information would be used to build a tax notice.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move within the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the mile of the road on which he drives.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, to be tested.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter where we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, who plans to start monitoring of miles of traffic for every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
That's what this technology is for.
The idea is that the Road Trust Fund financed by the taxes that Americans pay at gas stations is down.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars go a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in transport policy from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system paying for a mile away.
"This seems to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres travelled.
It is no surprise that this idea is liked by urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which can help, for example, reduce traffic congestion and create greenhouse gases.
California designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious Global Warming Act.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transport Committee, said he also saw this as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for miles away.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for strategy in the organization Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to head towards paying for a mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a USD 90 million pilot project last year to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing members of the population, whose daily life often means to travel many kilometres for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The hottest is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the State a mile tax instead of a gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is researching the project right now.
Illinois tries to do so to a limited extent in trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not just have advocates.
In Nevada, where the device was recently equipped with about 50 cars of volunteers, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"The Big Brother tracking and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs strategy and traffic management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project went on, the US Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full surveillance devices. ”
There is no need to build an enormous cumbersome technological infrastructure that inevitably extends to register daily trips and individual arrivals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find the available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers the car will drive, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said the public would be calmer.
The hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (a real distance away).
The company was originally not involved in the action to help the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging insurance market with legal liability, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they get away.
But this device that it tests attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and delivers only limited amounts of information that are regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you don't track their speed and location," says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have arisen in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometres all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the prudent public will accept this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay extra parking hours to provide insurance by mileage and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to participate in this because of the value of benefits offered to them," the city's projection document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometre are just a giant substitute problem.
Officials at the Metropolitan Committee on Transportation in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could easily solve the problem of a bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the gas tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical operations when it is enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
He negotiates for ČSSD Sobotka.
Social democracies are crumbling, folk and grandmothers are talking to each other, and they are preparing a common approach.
If the Social Democrats are overwhelmed within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly aligned partners, who will put on the table a finished list of demands including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD envoys will then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days, when he carried himself on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political grémium and, above all, forced convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only him, the other team members will only be allowed after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the grémium and now to the citizens.
It's not right to lie in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hasek said after the meeting of the narrowest leadership of social democracy.
He added that he did not adhere to the post of First Vice-President.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at the IOC," Hasek said.
The vice-president Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the club Jeroným Tejc spoke similarly.
However, he pointed out that he was elected just two days ago.
Both MPs then stated that they would do their best to make the 50-member ČSSD club sound in one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decision of party authorities."
Another lie on live TV.
Or perhaps in his call for Sobotka's resignation and his elimination from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August ÚVV had 57 percent agreed that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for premiership?
The head of the ČSSD, however, created a powerful army of enemies by calling the ÚVV until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a bunch of gossip and rumours, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be powerful laundry, signs of dark alliances between Zdenek Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
A friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
They bubble disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The warning is the words of Ostrava's mayor and of Sobotka's ally Peter Kajinar: "Chartu 77 I signed so that the country would not be ruled by idiots."
If the C.O.D. had gathered this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritualize the sacrifice of their functions.
The traitors will cover their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning ČSSD boss then ends up nicknamed Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is challenging
The pieces of his mouth indicate a tiny smile and then he just takes a deep breath, "It's hard."
The cooperation with the 2014 Sochi Olympics organizational team is, according to Martin the Doctor, a little more complicated.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on essential things not so much.
For example, we've been prying out of them for three months to give us a way to officially label individual villages so that we can do a number of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
There's a lot of things they communicate all the time.
Is the Olympic village at least finished yet?
But it's no longer a disastrous condition.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do you need finished floors?
Just basic concrete, that's what it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive as a vanguard on 26 January, he will still smell glue.
And if they didn't make it, what would they be?
President Putin would have driven an army there?
I guess that's how it's gonna turn out.
Just so it's not that Olympic village = the Potemkin village.
Rather, they are threatening to fail, for example, to adjust the roads, not to complete the details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to bring boots from the London Games with us.
But I believe they'll sort it out somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number is changing.
Like figure skaters, they're probably going in that three-way ride.
No one has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there on 26 January.
What will the houses in the Olympic village look like, we know.
We even measured some of our own things by subway so we wouldn't just believe in sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the mission chief do 100 days before the Olympic Games?
I'm preparing for an annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I'm doing a routine agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin promised an environmental Olympics, a plan to smite a giant secret dump.
Winter sports fans are already cutting a metre to the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympics, even if it doesn't start in February, are struggling with another scandal.
The Russians seem to fail to fulfill the promise that the preparations and games will not disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After all, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a bar built very high, Canadian games entered the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that Russia's President Vladimir Putin's commitment to hold games with "zero waste" has long since been taken over.
AP reporters discovered a giant landfill of construction material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi last week.
Thus, a landfill full of building material, tires, canisters and insulating foam was found by environmentalists in August, which they immediately reported.
Russian authorities repented and the landfill disappeared.
But only for a little while.
Last week, reporters saw a dump the size of three football fields.
Not the only one, in the area of such places arose several, described the British newspaper The Times.
Russian railways, a state monopoly, are working on the site, building a roughly 60-kilometre journey between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
An enterprise that already swallowed 280 billion rubles was led by one of Putin's close associates Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railroads defended themselves by the founding of a sub-contractor.
But the locals are desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been running around the village for three months day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu River, other streams, and ultimately the Black Sea.
"Water from here contaminates the Soče water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," told the British newspaper Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental nonprofit organization EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem with the Russian Organizing Committee and Government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison: Sochi games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
Last year's London games cost only 19 billion and mentioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and concerns about whether there will eventually be enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected while working on an exhibition of sports and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth in protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers are dealing with a new law during games that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given as an assignment to design a house on the plot, which lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself being somewhat weighed down.
The request further stated that there would be two generations living in the house who would want to live together, but at the same time each should have their own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping property.
Architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place in the design."
"Three different functions of the house are connected several ways through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
Parents' household is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree to which family traditions and memories are linked.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in various final arrangement of facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been molded using boards, the part where the office is, is plastered white and the remaining elements remain in clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, making the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
Parents' household, kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
Connecting the interior to the exterior underlines the side wall, which begins at the garden and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there rises up the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main landmark of the house's interior.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to cascadate through them.
That's what the architects were trying to distinguish the house from the others and put something unique in it.
The household of the young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room combined.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living zone with dining and kitchen part in the household of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely crosses the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance, find themselves in the lobby and then climb up the staircase.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, educators, and the management of secondary and college schools in several counties to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've seen more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the lecture of the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovec in the pre-election period, even received rematch in the form of an uninvited invitation to celebrate the Czech state holiday.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer brave and visited Miloš Zeman made possible: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Commercial Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of the promotion of politics at universities.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and it seems normal to him.
Professor, that's really not the same thing as staying as mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the ČSSD governors who simultaneously serve as MPs and governors and, like them, degrade both jobs?
Because that's what you're saying to people, you can handle both of these challenging functions.
I know, we have here the example of Michal Hasek, who can even handle several dozen functions at once.
I don't think that's exactly an example of the person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who prefers to leave the post of Member, so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the office of dean is that you will violate the apolitics of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current presence on both posts as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help your school without becoming dean.
I think your students will have the same opinion that I have and rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face on.
Otherwise, you may get counted by the voters in the next election.
And that doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovice, the cabbage bubbling, chemistry does not add to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut want to produce in the coming months in the Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé Food Group.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
Since 1925, he has been producing healthy delicacies here in the traditional way, i.e. walking directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our worker found a ten-mile route for the shift.
Fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage can fit into each of the ten tanks, one filling takes three shifts," said David Kladroba, director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
The cabbages are transported to the company's premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko.
Fruta staff then cleans the vegetables, removes the brooms and throws into the ring.
From there already sliced cabbage falls into swimming pools at a six-metre depth, in which the hookers work tirelessly dressed in white clothes and boots.
That's what fills out the unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with tarp and loaded with water.
"The green ring then matures for six to eight weeks under spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation aids," said director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to domestic production, individual layers of workers pour through salt and cumin.
The cabbage after fermentation goes to the filling line.
Packed in sweet and sour water into bags or jars and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage primarily to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It also registers interest in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “co-operate” with Germany in connection with U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence snitch, announced that he was willing to leave for Berlin to pass on evidence to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him about the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, who was passed on to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to act as a defector to the opposition and seeks to criminalize political speeches with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defense."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop charges of crimes filed against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said for Zeit Online magazine: “If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
Tensions in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when claims emerged that NSA had been eavesdropping on Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a Member of Parliament who runs a parliamentary panel overseeing the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US,” this should be done.
Mr Sträbele, Member of Parliament on behalf of the German Green Party, posted on his Twitter post a photo with Mr Snowden.
On their way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that, according to former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he had left one day.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be “safe there,” said a member of parliament.
In his letter, Mr Snowden said that he faced a harsh and persistent persecution campaign that forced him to leave home.
But he said that the whole world’s response to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and high officials – including those in the United States – assessed the discovery of an unjustified system of ubiquitous public service surveillance.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved. ”
We're sorry about the killing, but we're innocent.
Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of the Red Khmer and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
During the reign of the Khmer Reds, which relied between 1975 and 1979 on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture, and executions of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the then population.
This commander of the infamous S-21 prison granted the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia a life sentence in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan argued that they believed that they were acting in the nation's best interest and did not know what the actual extent of the killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he never ordered Red Khmer's cadres to "treat people badly or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Red Khmer regime, told the AFP that she could not accept Nuon Che's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"He doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he did not give orders, his subordinates would not kill," she added, adding that the leaders of the Khmer Reds are "worst than monsters".
The "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer Ieng Sara regime was also to stand trial, but he died this March.
His wife Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012, the court found an incompetent trial due to dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 for storing hand baggage on board during its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand baggage and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new baggage fee relates to luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance, and USD 100 if passengers with payment will wait until arrival at the gate.
Frontier's spokesperson Kate O'Malley stated that the $100 fee is intended to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
Airlines began charging first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed in hand luggage hidden in storage as much as they could, so there was often no space in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really isn't to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in line at Frontier's gate can bring a baggage for which he will not pay anything, while the other passenger in line for the same baggage will pay USD 100.
O'Malley said that the website and procedures of check-in will be modified to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before arriving at the gate.
Frontier's new baggage fee will not be valid until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see another baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
However, most of them did not charge for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand baggage three years ago, and another low-cost Allegiant Air company later followed its example.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says Air Transport Adviser Jay Sorensen, who closely follows additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand baggage fee would bring USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit fee for hand baggage.
"Getting on the plane was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my career," he said.
I expected to see teeth creaking and fighting at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the entrance took place in a flash".
Frontier will also apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice to Spirit.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and coffee will be refilled for free.
The water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but withdrew seven months later after passenger complaints, and no other significant airline did.
Frontier's last move to charge hand baggage if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline, its last effort is to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay Internet travel vendors such as Orbitz from US$10 to US$25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so through internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the furthest way in this area.
In September, she began to give customers who purchased via an Internet travel agency only half the miles within the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for flying miles to 25 percent of the miles from a given route.
So a journey with Frontier 1,000 miles long purchased through an Internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and its money is losing.
According to financial results shown on Wednesday by company partner Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and traffic capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
By selling this airline, the Republic is also trying to solve Frontier's financial problems.
NSA’s website does not blame hackers for the fall, but “inner error”
The mysterious National Security Agency reported last Friday that its website fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov website has not been accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the spy agency said in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the blackout was caused by the DDoS attack (distributed service rejection) is not true.
Previously this evening, the sensors of online servers noted that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Previously, NSA spokesman to ABC News reported that the agency's internal sensitive networks were not "at all" compromised.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for decommissioning NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers overload and the site falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
In recent months, the former super-secret agency NSA, which once earned the nickname No such agency, has become the focus of public attention after a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs and the target of biting critics a comprehensive product of estrangement of NSA secret files from the agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The profits of Bombardier fell as a result of a decrease in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier announced a 15 percent decrease in net profit on Thursday, which is due to a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft would comply with the ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft only flew three times and the question arose as to whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates, and stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange declined by 8 percent.
On Thursday, state bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating from "higher profitability" to "sector performance", expecting the stock exchange to experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"While smaller supplies of aircraft were expected mostly, the profit margin in the transport sector disappointed us significantly," said Doerksen in the customer report.
As the trial program continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market skepticism to increase against this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries-type aircraft will fight their way into the lower market area, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after several months of delay the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of CSeries aircraft's binding orders reaches modest 177 because potential buyers are waiting for test flight results to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and savings on the cost of this transport aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The executive director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The executives also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in a conference call, remarking that ground checks and software updates were planned during the aircraft's shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
Analysts are still skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating the CSeries plane 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan for putting the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the following months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – although consistent with Bombardier's internal plan – will probably reinforce our view that commissioning will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
From USD 172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending on 30 September.
Adjusted yields per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover marginally declined from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft producer reported that it had supplied only 45 aircraft a year earlier than 57 aircraft during that quarter.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The contracts failed in the aviation division amounted to $32.9 billion as of 30 September, which does not change even as of 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlooks, but the low reception of orders and the overall state of the market let us down," Beaudoin said.
The revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that the yield in this division rose by nearly 11 percent to USD 2.1 billion.
The failed transport contracts amounted to $32.6 billion as of 30 September, marginal growth compared to 31 December.
Profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the realization of several large contracts.
The executives stated that new projections would be provided in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google's financial director Patrick Pichette, declined by 8.5 percent to USD 4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft producer and closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10% drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
A cocaine addict's lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in jail.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information to the Underworld King Neil Scarbrough.
The attorney feared his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
The top defense attorney who informed a drug mobster of a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come out was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass sensitive information on his drug smuggling activities after becoming suspected of using cocaine to the underworld boss Neil Scarbrough.
The attorney, whose nickname was "Bash" (party), who was hailed by criminals as the best attorney, was arrested at his home in 2011.
Cops saw Sarborough (32) leaving three cocaine bags at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, just having dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he made an effort to get information on the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were under surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After arresting heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million, along with GBP 200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison together with them.
Ditta (42) was passing information to criminals for fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors law firm based in Blackburn, experienced shameful moments before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyers' fall occurred after Scarborough's police investigation found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him placing drugs of purity 60 percent under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone interview.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine conversations between the two persons.
In court, it was said that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, and said he spoke to a suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell under "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
In a police interrogation, he said that he operated an office at both his home address and the workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted prominent drug supply chain players, some of whom he had previously represented to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than a lawyer in a criminal law area? ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as an attorney and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
Police investigations foiled as much as they could to allow them to continue their crimes.
Mr. Ditta did not bring good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta refused the offense and stated: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and would like to pass on information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal in the criminal area when he began to get drugs from organized criminals. ”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly debilitated and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organised crime groups, which have given him the task of gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and should inspire confidence in the public and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted for three cocaine possessions and now for obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to trial.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We'll find you and put you in our court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Another 35 persons involved in the trade were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, saying that his dream work would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a dinner guest he would wish Mohammed Ali and stated inequality as motivation for the job.
He negotiated on the government with both Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won fourteen MPs in the election, i.e. only a third of the number of social democrats or YES representatives.
But they are entering into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which had already begun to argue the outlines of possible coalitions, Jan Kasal - a man who tuned the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrei Babiš do not have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will remind us of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a brand-new party.
"Experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will progress.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"It is a frightening report and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply wiping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said the newspaper calling the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extended hand of government" and that limits on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to Members," he said.
According to Star's daily bill, it effectively passes "complete control over the media" to the government, and Standard reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have "severed a hard blow", criticizing the bill as "severe".
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The anger of the authorities was turned on by Kenyan media as it aired a security camera footage, on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack reportedly looted a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a senior media officer called in for questioning, but the subpoena was later withdrawn after media pressure.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists can be fined up to one million along with the risk of “listing off” or may be denied official journalist accreditation.
The General Court shall also have the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is even one fine enough to eliminate most radio stations.”
It is also reported that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan "live blogosphere".
Politicians know that when they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," wrote the journalist of Nation Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenya's media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of cuts ordered by the national payroll agency and for the restoration of their fat salaries of around 532,000 unpaid shillings per month, thus ranked among the highest in the world.
The savings must be made, the young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea with what interest
More and more Czechs put money aside.
Yet they do not reach the champions in saving in the region.
The Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros a month, put the most money aside.
A little more than the Czechs save even people in Slovakia.
This results from the Erste Savings Barometer survey in Central and Eastern European countries.
It also showed that savers’ moods are improving, and two thirds of those polled plan to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the savers' rankings, in Romania and Serbia, people saving products still use very little.
For example, almost every other Serb saves at home "under the pillow" according to the survey.
In the country this year, the number of people who save more money each month has increased.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents put down a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns for a variety of savings, this year it is five percent more.
The average monthly allowance in year-on-year comparison, however, decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension insurance.
This favors 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of construction savings is decreasing, and interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to the previous year.
Only 16 percent of respondents use them, while it was almost a quarter of the people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save money, most of them do not know what yields they make on individual products.
Above all, young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is remunerated.
On the contrary, 73 percent of those surveyed have the best knowledge of the profitability of their deposited money.
In an international comparison, Erste Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12-percent distance.
The UN celebrates new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations is immediately starting to work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Pan Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that now is the time "to rise above national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – the SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and implement our vision of sustainable development objectives that build on the success of the MDG.
The security concerns of Mozambique are escalating due to the conflict of strong personalities
Thousands of people gathered under the statue of Samora Machela, the Mosambian Founder's President, in downtown Maputo to invoke peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
For fear of the future of her country, she traded business clothes for a T-shirt adorned with "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo Party, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the White Government in Rhodesia and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After a peace agreement in 1992, he became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely for open conflict to break out again in the country, but recent events have frightened foreign investors and locals.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of vast coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest can bring investment worth more than $50 billion from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have been blaming each other for the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo party claims that the government sparked the last conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault of former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afons Dhlakam, the group leader, said for the Financial Times a spokesman for the Renamo Party Fernando Mazanga.
The government blames Renamo for launching conflicts because it said it was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuda tried to alleviate the fear of instability.
Mr Guebuda said to AFP's French press office on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "wrecker" who wanted to use "whatever was left of his strength to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo Party is withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
FT said that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the deal.
"Our aim is to return to negotiations, but seriously," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate tensions between these parties, fuelled by a series of skirmishes this year, little.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebusa and Dhlama), said lecturer at Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither is a good negotiator, and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which sought electoral changes, has already said that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a dying movement to obtain benefits and financial gain from the government.
Renamo Party's vote share has been decreasing since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by former Renamo Party member, is expected to improve its position in the election.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuba – whose second term ends next year – wants to destroy this country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a more party democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what possibilities the Renamo party has, but it has carried out disruptive terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on a key road between north and south.
Most of the skirmishes occurred in the province of Sofala, which, while several hundred kilometres away from the capital Maputo, was a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely, were exporting coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad for about a week when the Renamo Party threatened to attack this line.
Mr Mazanga did not wish to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration from government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development rates, and recent kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president are solely responsible for the country's future and that he is to be the one to find solutions to problems," he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends such as “models for a way of life, ” says the author.
Tales of Thor may show that “gross force cannot compare to clever treachery", while Arthuric legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of the myths would “be too wild for school teaching, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene", said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk works are already part of education," he said.
I've defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that "openly instructing" authors and teachers are like a "off switch" in an engaging story with a "underfloor" message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and who also writes Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and British National Tales, says: “You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them to yourself. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children requires a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended with a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly determined.
The old truth about it is better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory takes visitors to space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the great planetarium has changed over the past six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can plunge into new comfortable seats and above their heads added a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the painting perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brno Observatory Jiří Dušek.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than classical personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician from the observatory.
Digitalarium can conjure an extremely realistic and plastic model of night sky, human body or ocean floor.
It's how viewers find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a man.
Another similar device is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project purchased shows and their own works in the hall.
Two shows have been on since Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people learn about astronaut training, fly into space, turn to the centrifuge, and then see in the illustrations how challenging conditions astronauts face in the cosmos.
The second show is for children and has the name Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano exploded.
The entire digitarium cost approximately CZK 50 million, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector cost twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed by audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed two years ago.
According to Director Dušek, between 25 and 30 thousand visitors could come by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 THOUSAND OF INSURANTS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 advertisements offering jobs, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 advertisements (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet thus becomes the most important medium for publishing job offers.
Even in 2005, when the survey first took place, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it settled at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, advertising of job opportunities largely reflects the current situation in the labour market.
A simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in periods of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis may be an example.
For example, in 2007 almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period of reference, with fewer than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said author Pavlína Šťastlová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
Ads looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken a leading role on the Internet.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation belongs mainly to the service and working professions.
Among the most frequently stated requirements expressed by employers through advertising offer are, of course, education.
Other monitored areas included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of foreign language was listed in 3% of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only 2% of employers’ advertisements, they demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in daily print in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
For workers' professions it is mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical equipment, adding the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employers shall also indicate in the middle of their advertisements the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
Communication skills have been shown as the most frequently required skills in advertising in the long run.
Furthermore, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that the city of New York is where a solo comic performance was born in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people by the method of conversation.
Faye's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
Founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, she celebrates her tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the point that they were too big to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (to stand up for heroes), an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, at which, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
Just as this festival has spread, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival emerged from non-traditional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose with his sitcom (a cheerfully spicy "League" on a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the "Saturday night live" and "Parks and Recreation" program, but the most famous was the rapidly spreading series of "Marcel the shell with shoes on" videos.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a vicious, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are a product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest moves will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedian historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV Land show at the station called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in Larry's entire work's comedy DNA," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he walks down the aisle between two buildings and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
The price of oil fell further to $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday as concerns about high stocks were offset by a report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European electronic trading on the New York Trade Stock Exchange during the late morning.
Thursday was a decline of 39 cents, and for October it fell by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have been burdening the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy on Wednesday stated that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports of Chinese production, the stimulus came to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after the growth that has risen after the previous two weak decades in the third quarter to 7.8 percent.
Brent oil, an indicator for international oil also used by American refiners, fell on the London International Trade Exchange by 26 cents to $18.58 a barrel.
Oh, no, Mr. Haschek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the way it is.
It is necessary to put so much pressure on Martin Hasek to be stripped of all political functions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so slim.
Martin Hasek is covering himself with the promise he has made, but everyone and the politician must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš has the material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr. Haschek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm it, if you weren't lying - here you see how difficult it is with lying), you leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless wimp whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, even a erring person or a life-long skunk.
You may find it unfair to address only you, but you're the leader and they're just misguided sheep.
And you're the leader, and you've always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to lower your ears for a while, regroup your powers, sit down with that disgrace and then attack again, but that's how partisans or backstabbers act.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so act like one.
Accept responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the regulation on the procedure of stopping and searching persons by the NYPD in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked a court order requiring changes in the program of stopping and searching persons in the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Federal Court of Appeals said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the decision to appeal filed by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city's conclusions and corrective regulations have come to mind, including a decision to allocate supervision to the police department to help change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The appeal court heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested postponement.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge must be removed from the case because she was in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge according to the requirement to avoid the appearance of bias, partly due to a series of interviews with the media and a public statement which she openly responded to to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when wrongly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search persons.
It established independent supervision to supervise major changes, including reform in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of the pilot programme in order to test cameras worn on the body in some areas where the most frequent stopping occurs.
In August, the city of New York agreed to terminate the method of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people criticized a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there have been stopping and searching people for about a number of decades, but recorded tours under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically grown to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men who all belong to minorities filed a lawsuit that became a case of group action.
Supporters of the changes to the program of stopping and searching persons carried out by the NYPD claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and can influence how other police departments use these procedures.
Opponents claim that changes will reduce police morals, but not crime, and that money will be wasted, but a broader problem will not be solved when the police force is under pressure after several thousand people have reduced its numbers over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching persons who are constitutional, but reformed the way the police department in NY introduced searches.
One-fifth of shopping centres face low attendance
This is based on data from real estate consultancy companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague's Bohnices, the Kraków Shopping Centre opens to the public, being the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
There are now 90 large commercial centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance involves about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are the inadequately large center towards the site and the poor layouts, too many floors or complicated and unclear arrangement of passages or dead points of centers," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to retail real estate manager Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the business centers face low attendance.
The main reasons include, among other things, poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or market excess in a given location.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays customers are rather conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new business centers must try harder to 'characterize' their customers into new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupation of shopping centres is generally stable, even in some centres rising, as landlords were willing to reduce rent and rent some units in a crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and the average occupancy is thus reduced (e.g.Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Trade centres opened in the past two years are being promoted very slowly in the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
However, there is a market place for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for building a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, called 'convinience centers', aimed at buying and services of daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extension in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague it sees space for the upcoming business center on Vítězný náměstí, also according to it they have a clear potential of Na Příkopě street and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, allowing traders to cover and expand to smaller cities for favourable rents and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of the Prior business houses, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková of DTZ.
90 modern shopping centres are currently located in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million sqm of gross lettable areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, there are nine in Prague, the data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check the tip
Former newspaper editor News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods “to hack into the phone, monitor, and confront” to confirm a fraudulent tip on the love relationship that then interior minister Charles Clarke was to be involved in.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Edis at Old Bailey's trial said the News of the World newspaper caught false reports in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but it was said in court that Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
"The state representative suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but the person who likes to give people stories to see what they have to say," Mr.Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, tracking, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
She obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, she needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say: “Of course he knows.”
Rumors about the love relationship Clarke is involved in were first captured by the NotW News Department when sources who had a sexual interest in Mrs. Pawlby were said: "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
The recording with voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was retrieved at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous calls in which information about Pawlby was requested, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former Chief Rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former Rapporteur James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Mrs Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail telling her: “I received a story that we are about to publish tomorrow and that Charles and I would love to talk about. ”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
At the trial on Thursday, it was said that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman, while he himself was seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with other persons in order to hack into telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck, and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
Uncovering the NSA Raises Social Paranoia Monitoring by the State
One peaceful day towards the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. Consular Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), a German home news agency, the mission was intended to take photographs of the roof of the U.S. forward patrol, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV office hoped to be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event triggered an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence options “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies, thereby strengthening their international competitiveness or increasing their profits".
But ever since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, began revealing his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading entrepreneurs no longer know whether to trust the Director's words.
Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data with which U.S. cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, reached general paranoia about state surveillance of new dimensions.
The last straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been bugged for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the leading entrepreneurs are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has transparentized intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey issued in July by the EY advisory service, German companies are convinced that the US now poses as much risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft.
However, there is no evidence in all the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities, and have stated that it should seek to limit its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of it.
There are voices from the German Parliament that we should make German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and open them again slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scope and technical refinement of American spy agencies revealed by Snowden is still shocking to some companies who have so far believed China to be the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a large turnaround in cloud computing, where European officials have widely realised that data stored in the US falls under the jurisdiction of that country and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-American members have cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the US after the US Prism data mining program was unveiled.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEOs, says: "Do we have a new question for customers who weren't here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets, and this data must be protected at all costs.
Economic espionage is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"It has been a major topic for many years and it has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
In general, business leaders do not want to brag too much about the countermeasures they have taken to possibly not give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of the Audi car company, says that it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the board meeting in order to prevent them from being used as listening devices.
The German BfV Office advises managers to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign travels due to the risk that smartphones can be misappropriated.
Prepaid cell phones will then be thrown out.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," he warns in his BfV report.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington post, the National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France alongside Russia and Israel in the second row of perpetrators involved in hacking activities for economic rapporteurs, just behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free company concluded that as far as economic espionage is concerned, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, a former head of the French internal news agency DCRI, stated this month in one of the talks: “Services know quite well that all countries, although cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a twisted wrestling spirit at his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdosta, Georgia was found stuck on January 11 in a leveled spiritual behind the bleachers at the gym high school where he went.
Sheriffs' investigators from Lowndes County County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old youth rejects it.
"They are confident their son was murdered," lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They believe it contradicts logic, physical laws, and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's supposed to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a body bag," he said.
State's Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
stated Moore at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "positional asphyxiation".
The second autopsy, however, according to Moore, gave another cause of death.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if, in Johnson's case of death, he reveals enough evidence for an injunction to investigate a crime or a civil rights violation, he will request the FBI and implement it.
The Deputy Sheriff's Office of Lowndes was not immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance videos that investigators have viewed.
Juvenile parents hope video footage will contain a clue to how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in case of children's allergies to food at school.
This is the first set of such directives that the U.S. government has issued because the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The CDC Center found that the incidence of food allergy in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines include information for schools on how the teacher’s choir and staff are aware of food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if there is a reaction.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline at their disposal – the most frequently used EpiPen automatic injector – in order to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone's sticking in my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "It itchy my tongue."
Parents of intersexual children may choose “undefined sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an ambiguous genital system.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to list any sex for such children, and allows them to list sex as “indeterminate” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to decide rashly for their child to operate to determine gender, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersexual.
After many years, an intersexual, according to the BBC, said: “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I'll stay plastered by a doctor, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that out of 2,000 children each year, one is born that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, an overarching term for those who have atypical chromosomes, genital glands (eggers or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it instead of waiting and following the psychological and physical development of the child until the surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determining problems, said that the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
Sex identification can be performed without surgery and then the identity can be waited to develop.
Knowledge of how a child develops sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report sent to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These traits may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital tract, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the work area, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify male, female or "third sex" in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexual" person to win a judicial appeal to retain the status of "undefined" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, they will have German passports other than M (male) and F (female) third designation, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove "sex theory" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic online website also defined itself against the German law and wrote: “With the world being dragged to a new state, when gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two other pillars of civilization. ”
A newborn mother from Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would prefer to see children given sex at birth.
"Parentship itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said for the parent care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community believed that gender was something like a board that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, with the fact that sexual affiliation is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes choose incorrectly because they do not know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
Persistent theories about how to treat children with ambiguous sex were presented by Dr John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was malleable.
He created the new term "sexual affiliation" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – how parents raised their child – affected children's genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
The parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to poorly performed circumcision, recommended that they have their child completely castrated, removed his testicles and raised him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he got re-operated back to the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still use the “this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared "discontent with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes, but an ambiguous sexual system.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said for ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18, he was sent to have a sheath sculpture.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After I was born, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genital system.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses, and had his breasts removed,
Surgery caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director of Advocates for informed choice, based in California, fears that the German law "calls on branding and stigmats".
"Many activists fear that the German law will achieve by encouraging parents to make a quick decision and choosing ‘undefined’ for the child," she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will eventually come out, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is going to assign it at birth.
That's a battle a little child shouldn't have to wage at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist of Pittsburgh's chest who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said that the German law would "give powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but she doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
She is now a 29-year-old Katie married, and as a student at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as an intern in child psychiatry.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run certain tests and think about it and gives them time to write "man" or "woman".
In this respect, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you enjoy it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings about the possibility of involving a child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child decides with which sex he identifies more – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk spilled gasoline all over the house: He threatened to burn it down with his own family!
Tensions increased, fear escalated.
The man threatened to burn down the house.
That is why all available police patrols in the area, as well as a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire department, set out on the site.
A police negotiator came to the scene, who tried to talk men out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to burn down the house.
Thus, a task force had to break into the house, which defused the men and bound them.
The agresor then finished for examination at the Mladá Boleslav Hospital, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic detention station.
Firefighters eventually filled the house with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition, all pets were also rescued from the house.
A man didn't give up on a police negotiator, so a commando followed him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisor secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly anticipated book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
Times magazine acquired a copy of the coming book and announced Thursday night that the president's top co-workers held intense group meetings and polls in late 2011 to estimate whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hope of re-election.
According to the National-Political correspondent for Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and at the White House, namely former White House White House White House chief, Bill Daley, to measure the effect that former Secretary of State Clinton would have on the election's move to the post of vice president.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the President's closest advisors – including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina and former chief advisors at David Axelrod's White House and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of trying to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make that move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not greatly increase the "Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I have examined a number of things intensively, and this was one of them," Daley said.
You must not forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we thought, “Jesus Christ, what are we supposed to do? ”
While Daley characterized research as "due care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had made considerable investments to see if this move would pay off in the election.
"In campaigns, such money is not spent on elections and quality research unless something is seriously considered," Martin said at AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about this potential card shuffle.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of potential changes, the former office manager admitted that he was "possible", that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on removing Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice cream to shine in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis utilized the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a glowing treat.
He came up with the idea when he read an expert treatise on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes lightning.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – increases the pH in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious", says, "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for GBP 200 you get about 2 grams of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, it increases the pH level and the ice cream begins to glow.
We've been testing it in the last few months, and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it's causing this fantastic radiant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the medusa lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every hill costs me about GBP 140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
However, its next product is to be even more ambitious.
She says: “I really wish I could make invisible ice cream. ”
In its essence, it's impossible because of the refraction of the light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I'm counting on some way to do it to find it.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a lowlife.
For two years, there hasn't been candy in my apartment, and this year probably won't be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, the black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans – in fact, 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I look forward to every Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, out of 6.9 billion dollars spent, 1.2 billion are expected to go into costumes.
This year, the latest fad of fashion is sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy may not just be women anymore; food like pizza, hamburger, and carrot can also be sexy.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the dead parade, and I bet the space men of Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pet pets.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
This is roughly 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers candy and Clark sticks.
This is amazing news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to ambush our neighborhoods.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, we consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association around Halloween, nearly 16,000 tons are sold.
That's about nine billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I never figured out.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are $1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that, according to American haunted houses, have $500 million in profits, and this includes those amazing photos that you're pissed on and put on Facebook by your friend, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will look at the picture and post a comment like "nice face".
And finally, a little something about pumpkins.
Ever since we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a large pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the trend of “baby in pumpkin” started only last year thanks to the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up carving the gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting up their pumpkin weighing nearly a ton.
Announced series of Land Rover racing
The interior has race seats and six-point safety belts as well as communication equipment.
The choice is improved brakes, service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, the technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The race participants who come to Bowler have changed. ”
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as an achievable journey to world class races.
We are happy to offer them this trip in collaboration with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it prepares contestants for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last in an interview for Aktuálně.cz, he said there was no other way out, and every government that came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible glue.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that the lifetime of the starting term estimates within two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose otherwise next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, President TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (as opposed to 2010 losing roughly 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that the early elections would be, it would strengthen the ANO 2011 movement Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
Turbulent situation in ČSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka stated after a secret January meeting part of the party's leadership that either he or Michal Hasek would remain in the lead of social democracy, commenting Schwarzenberg in his own way:
"Leading Democratic Party officials as little boys go to head of state to allow them a coup in the party".
"I thought Mr. Hasek was more skillful and intelligent."
"Because I have never seen something so badly done in my life," said TOP Chairman 09.
And towards President Zeman (who he had clashed with in the fight for presidential office) he said, "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize the party."
The first laws have already been tabled by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the House, including the Farsky Register of Treaties, which was discussed by House committees before the election, but fell below the table with early elections.
TOP 09 chairman in an interview for Aktuálně.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, the TOP 09 obviously wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in a pre-election fight of the idea of introducing a contract register "stealing" the program of the ANO movement.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply brushed off a proposal that has already reached the second House reading.
Fire Departments arrived to rescue the lost puppy, who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in the stone quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog saw him trapped in a stone quarry.
Firefighters fell down the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire units that arrived to rescue it after somehow trapped itself on a dangerous protrusion in a stone quarry 15 metres above the ground.
Nine-month cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived alone for three days until he was rescued from the stone quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) with their girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit stone quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet with Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After escaping when he got into a small accident, they feverishly searched for their lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday at about 14.15, a bright-sighted doggie spotted Ruby stuck on a protrusion in a stone quarry 15 metres above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the site and rappelled down to free Ruby, using a transport bag for animals to pick him up after the rock.
Technical Rescue Team Chief Andy Clayton said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The sight of a dog is incredible.
Technical Rescue Team Chief Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape. ”
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Looking at the rescue action, I was afraid. ”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in my arms.
The vet said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The fire department did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're so grateful to them, everyone was just great.
Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he might fall, but he remained there. ”
The fire department was great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't go after that 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard" she sang backing vocals.
Perry said she had dinner with this rock veteran when she was 18, and he went after her.
She added: “It was a long time ago, and now he is very kind to me. ”
In a statement from Thursday Jagger's (70) representative said he categorically refuses to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said: “Maybe he's confusing him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the guest singers (songwriters) who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted in the first place this week.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another ghost story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave cause to stories about passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's valu.
The truth is that Strathclyde has mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this has not been reflected in the headlines of the newspaper.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if it suits them.
Since Scotland is not in Schengen right now, the offer of continued inconsistency would be a cheap concession to Brussels for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
Moreover, so old that it became an excavation, a journalist's duck that "independence means passport checks", I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting thought in this bearded story.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe in the first place?
Why trade London's chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
In the aftermath of the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, insider resistance parties to the EU or the abolition of the euro are gaining influence as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came as if out of nowhere and already in the September federal elections captured nearly five million votes, thus essentially "destaging" free democrats (the equivalent of British Liberal Democrats) from Bundestag.
On domestic soil, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with a straitjacket put on national economies through a shared currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit – that was only true for Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and German politicians want to keep that.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public spending – which is what Germany calls for.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is the deeper cause of European malaise performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – the code to support French and German firms on consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for petrol as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we've seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even any wage freeze in the world would not avert the bailout of the European petrochemical industry by cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering revolt, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that Germany would keep at bay and allow Paris to stand on the level of Washington in the world.
However, Berlin no longer needs and enforced its own economic policy in Europe as a card of political legitimacy, leaving the worn out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that right-wing fission is automatically positive on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
In doing so, I think that, in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and the stance against the common currency will come together and the euro will perish.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn into something more free in the sense of “Europe (sovereign) nations”, already favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and draw close to the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed European order, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement not promoting austerity in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011, due to the opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to now vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Advanced earlier
Research has shown African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this
Experts argue that one of the triggers of early puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so evident in boys.
Former CNN rapporteur Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter begins to grow breasts and pubic hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Physicians this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time convincing my parents that it was usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair and underarms and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age when the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, it is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years will pass before the first menstruation occurs," Kaplowitz said, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8, the girl is considered "premature".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which children’s doctors can closely monitor.
Rapider growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bone, which may eventually lead to a cessation of growth and dredging in adulthood.
Recommendations on drugs and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “the suppression of puberty can alleviate the problems of a girl’s behavior and her feelings that she is different from her peers.”
Understandable is another major problem: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are concerned that they can get pregnant or how they will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began her period at age 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones are to blame in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he assisted in conducting a study on girls aged 6 to 9 who linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
Globally, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climates to genes.
Another puzzle: Although young boys already show hair on their faces and on their shame, the trend towards full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the American Association of Children's Physicians (AAP) conference added additional complexity to the subject.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean talking to a child sooner than you would expect," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who are developing earlier need assurances that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Konvalinkova in the role of innkeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinkova (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of innkeeper and she was very good at it.
That perhaps the popular Czech actress planned to change professions and put herself into business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinka appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and shot beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right.
The boss even offered to hire me and I could spin beer for a living.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I do today, with acting," Konvalinkova said, smiling, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and sometimes I have Irish whiskey," the actress revealed.
Nadi longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I'm not allowed to drink in my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to follow that," added the actor.
Aircraft manufacturers argue about the width of seats, big orders are at stake
A dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the second class for long-distance flights ignited, giving rise to bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai this month.
The object of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-distance flights for the economic class – not exactly the one usually preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus called for industry standards this week that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economic class, but the major American rival Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in selling the largest version of their two-engine long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear part of the aircraft is distributed – especially whether it is next to each other 9 or 10 seats – is the basis of economic performance requirements for design of new aircraft "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" delivers 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread by 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a rival version of its A350 model delivers 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out by 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus now ahead of an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to win the predominance with over 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
He recently tentatively showed what might be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture depicting three people sealed in a restaurant with the headline “Would you like it? ”
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seats narrower than in regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
As the eating sauce changes, people are larger, but seats on airplanes have not radically changed.
From the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49, according to the US Department of Health, increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of seats of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research suggesting that an extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus’s seats and says it is not up to the aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they must do to be successful," said the Kent Craver Cabin Expert.
They don't want us dictating what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
A larger area for passengers is essential for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute is a race in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to deflect the weights of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing argue that they achieve 20 percent better efficiency for their latest design of two-engine long-distance aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance requirements depend partly on comparing the 777X model design with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason why Boeing is doing this is to fill more seats, and make its aircraft more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, manager for the comfort of passengers at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser distribution that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"A four-inch seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus, the design is motivated by the threat of model 777," said interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose.
Traveled aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive arrangement.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more cab modifications by offering wider seats in alleyways for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard, but can discourage the wave of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected has exceeded a thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people grows annually.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and by 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected, and it was a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavý, who ran the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country last January to September, with 176 this year for the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemia Region, 206 were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravskoslezský or 116 from Ústecký.
The least infected came from the Highlands, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, transferred from their mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, the experts claim
A fantastic film from Space Gravity for some time after the premiere sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic.
In October, almost 150 thousand viewers saw it, according to the Union of Film Distributors, and made over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I like science-fantastic films, which I consider to be modern, dream stories.
Not to mention the film Gravity, although it does look like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which somehow doesn't float in a weightless state.
Hubb's Space Telescope and International Space Stations are moving on significantly different orbits, therefore they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film reproach the unrealistic effect and the entire conduct of the fire in a weightless state.
They don't think the suits could take that kind of punch either.
Heroes in the movie Gravity often get into a collision with different objects and suits without much trouble can withstand everything.
Criticism was not spared even the plot.
Such an extensive tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some debaters.
Besides, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People also argue in forums about "unnearly" conduct of ropes.
It's supposed to look like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can clearly say that I have been charmed.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (nearly duty) not to stick to consistently reality.
"More than you mentioned inconsistencies touched me, how the space station with the degraded level of technology (last Chinese) is shown three times."
"Chinese will be late in the decade, after all, and it will probably look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors try very successfully not to violate physical laws, and so naturally oriented viewer appreciates that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, quite rightly retains the moment of momentum, said the dictionary of physics, also the view of Earth from space is very realistic including a thin shell of atmosphere and a polar glow flashing on polar areas.
There's bound to be some inconsistencies in a more detailed investigation.
In addition, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit in some scenes appears to be reversed than it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (an employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but no major and sky-calling offenses against logic or natural laws have been recorded in the film, and compared to other films of a similar focus, it is evident that the creators have taken care of the credibility of the events displayed.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that Hubble's space telescope orbits a different downward orbit than the ISS.
The result is a significantly different mutual speed, and a rescue operation could therefore not actually run as it was shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the whole ISS rotated, therefore there is not even a clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence for life.
Before the human trials, further tests are needed, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong to overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information to produce antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies persecute all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine intervention.
In the tests of the vaccinated mouse, which was additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that have not been vaccinated “calmed down, ” said researchers, a sign that nicotine has gotten into their brain.
Experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine magazine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain an adequate level of antibodies, thus proving expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they were ready to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine dependence.
More likely, however, it would be used by smokers to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they will have no pleasure in it, and that will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they warn that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the state corruption oversight committee.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied changing coastal lease policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Committee on Corruption (ICAC) expanded its search on Friday to see if Mr. Obeid lobbied with several state ministers in order to rent him a Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without having to participate in a tender after its expiration in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence submitted on Thursday by former Deputy Head of the Office of Mr Tripodi, Lynn Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public competitions.
The tenants opposed this and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rentals for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought to the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in the competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of calls presented at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Lords Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the development of commercial lease policy during these phone calls?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible officer
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, confirmed by the responsible administration officer of Fox News Station.
This responsible factor did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press press agency reports that the target was the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an air attack on missile supplies in Syria.
Many things have moved, and they are different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that one could agree with it, whereas Chairman Štěch was stirring up discord.
Captain Behavior was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
The President of Sobotka has always been, and he is a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD still.
The other gentlemen demonstrated their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is a principled and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek has made the most interview impossible on television.
Based on this, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to propose as Prime Minister to Senate Vice-President Gajdušková, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think it would do a standard performance.
That's such a good solution that he's barely backed by anyone in charge.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdušková could unafraidly build a minority government with mere blessing from Prime Minister Babiš and without the People's Party, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a religious social Democrat.
This minority government would have great stability, as it would advocate a proper referendum law, and so would the chairman of the Dawn of Okamura.
President Babiš would eventually accept the tax progression, for he is bright and will see that he can't do it without her.
People wouldn't be in trouble because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, even here a valuable minister would be found, but if reasonably they do not want to enter into risky government participation, but they will also provide support, well.
Let's give Alena Gajdishek courage!
Foreign workers with visa authorisation may undergo a ‘legality’ test
As the government intends to extend police procedures, it considers the test of 'legality' for foreign workers with visa authorisation of 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through the mediation of criteria in order to prevent the 457 program from being used to fulfil unskilled jobs, or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was released today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned government rhetoric about foreign workers saying it might offend Australian neighbors.
“Lowered statements “foreigners at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant from the time the unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said today for the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white labor force should have been protected – and I would not have wondered if anyone in this region had noticed an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he negotiates with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remaining for consideration.
If the ‘legality’ criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking."
After previous experience with businesses intending to sponsor a small number of workers but then employing hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who sought asylum died with suspicion of a heart attack after arriving this week on an asylum ship to the Christmas Islands.
A man’s nine - year - old frightened son traveled to Australia along with him and after his father’s death on Wednesday was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
The Australian authorities and the man rushed to the hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the advantages of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Great Britain together".
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" by working with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After completing Phase Two, the line will lead from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government re-evaluated the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the Transport Scotland National Transport Office, commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is indeed a national network that will better connect Great Britain and its cities. ”
We've given SH2 the green light because the benefits that this will bring are huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also a connection – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across Great Britain thanks to HS2.
Scottish minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "clearly" support Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed line has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of the high-speed railway across Britain."
So we are enthusiastically working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed rail to Scotland and thus to bring benefits to everyone and supplement Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British ministers during the next year and the joint decision-making on further steps.
Together with Bárta, the inspector and analyst of the anti-corruption police arrested
Information on the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday night, when the report was delivered by the server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF TODAY soon found out that the case was in charge of the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS), her people were to arrest Barta in the center of Prague.
It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
Inspections solve cases where there are accused police officers, but their jurisdiction also applies to civilian persons.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - Jan Petržílek, head of analysts and computer science, is among the arrested.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
The anti-corruption police spokesperson Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the fact that the media had to turn to GIBS on this matter.
But also her inspection spokesman Radka Sandorová did not want to say anything about the case, she referred in turn to the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be deduced from this vague reaction that the event has taken place, but is in a secret mode that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even in this matter", but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or refute Bart's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted by Bart together with former VV chairman Radek John, who was in charge of the Interior Ministry.
The dispute, which, because of this, was heated between the expremier Petr Nečas and VV, even then President Václav Klaus had to deal with.
I have no idea where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't questioned.
"I really don't know anything about things," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Officially, Radek John, the real party leader, put him through it, but he was Barta at the time.
Barta now ran for the Dawn Movement election, the parliamentary mandate escaped him only narrowly - by 175 votes.
Dawn Leader Tomio Okamura stated that he had no idea what was going on.
"Welcome to Bárta was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the election, he was neither a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who said before the election that he had given Bart space to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of executors.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during launch and landing even without regard to changes in the US in order to mitigate regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given American companies space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in a "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are bothered that they cannot have access to their electronic books during launch and landing.
Australian carriers examine this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it has examined this notification, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic equipment on aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, who had already spoken to CASA about extending the use of its on-board Wi-Fi entertainment system, was inclined to change, but announced that it would submit to the decision of the regulatory authority.
"We would welcome CASA's analysis of permission to use electronic devices, because we really think it would improve customer experience now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment)," said the spokesperson.
Qantas has announced that it will follow current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that in the near future," he said.
FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that may be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly study thoroughly the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will differ from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference with mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training material, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
"Once the airline confirms its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the device during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the storage space above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are experiencing a boom
At a pawnshop in the Bendemeer shopping cent in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money on it," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator she receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is inadequate, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is such that ValueMax, where a woman carries out her transaction, has become the third pawnshop on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income, and can lend faster than banks.
That is why millions of people across the region turn to pawnshops, with families feeling pressure due to increasing life costs and rising household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium income turn to pawnshops to deal with a worsening financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor's credit rating agency cited the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia due to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with increasing costs, people from the middle to the low [income range] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Song Wun, an economist at CIMB, Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to people’s hastily stopping their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and we get it back next month.
The largest pawnshop operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
Growth in the pawn sector is so large that ValueMax, an operator of a branch in central Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it acquired this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors found themselves under fire by critics over high interest rates, Mrs Yeah says that the pledge offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers stop objects they already own, and monetizing personal property does not increase household debt," he says.
In society, asset pledges are increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure funding.
Moreover, those who use pawnshops are not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when stopping gold rods or Rolex watches, and can thus reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible proportions.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term due to their bold business or investment, or small businesses who need help solving their cash flow problems," says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for dying health care in Tasmania contains harsh conditions to ensure that the state government does not squander funds.
Federal Health Secretary Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is making "accelerated measures" to avert the crisis caused by the aging population of the island, the higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilki.
"The government came up with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract operations, will help eliminate debt.
The money is also available to free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic systems of health records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to ideas that leading clinicians told me would help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to receive the money from the Australian Union, and inform monthly where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will be useless, “until a real reform follows in order to lay a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system.”
Still, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised in dealing with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal aid package can get public health out of critical condition," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal Health Opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just a "plast".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has taken $430 million out of our medical system," he said for ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes away nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that devotes $300 million, and pretends it's good news.
Mr Dutton has called on Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar from the rescue package will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicoux adapted the novel Denise Diderota, which brings an exceptional film expedition and portrayal of the time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 18th century in France and tells a gloomy story about Suzanne, a young noble woman who is sent by her family to a monastery.
When she revolts, she experiences extremely cruel treatment from the criminally perverted mother superior and for others she becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lewdness or sensationalism, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story results in the audience experiencing torment similar to wearing a horsehair shirt.
Ski resorts want to make families with children cheaper
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing resources, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, saying on Thursday the Committee on Global Chemical Weapons Supervision, while severe conflicts in the north of the country broke out, near one of the sites where toxic substances are expected to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before November 1,
the deadline set by this organisation based in The Hague for the destruction or disabling of the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery equipment for the mixing of chemicals for the purpose of creating toxic gas and ammunition.
Completion of this basically initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including syperite and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came when the fights in the city of Safira raged on Thursday, which experts refer to as the headquarters of the chemical weapons factory and storage sites, said the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
A group of activists who, through a network of activists in Syria, monitored the total number of casualties, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of this, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters, and 187 militants from Lebanese Hezbollah.
There should also be 2,202 government defectors among the killed, and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN organization estimated that 100,000 people had died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million inhabitants to leave the country.
Assad's troops fought in Saphira against insurgents, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observation room stated Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific numbers.
Fighting has highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in their mission, when Syria is to get rid of the chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight terms.
In a statement from the OPCW, which closely cooperates with the UN, it was said that his team was now “satisfying to verify – and monitor the destruction – of Syria's declared essential manufacturing and blending equipment/filling equipment".
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 locations declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two locations due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, OPCW reported that these two locations were “abandoned according to Syria and ... the items of the chemical weapons program it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were inspected".
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery you displayed in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had," said Ahmet Uzumcu's observer director in his comment issued by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawites sect, stand against each other in the civil war, especially the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government, which are offshoots of Shia Islam.
In terms of further developments, the head of Ramí's Watcher Abdul Rahmán said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday inside an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the sentence brought upon the mastermind of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing responded in anger to the verdict delivered on the last of the curriculumers who were brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were left dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other counts related to terrorism, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life imprisonment even though it could insist that a man nicknamed "Demollition Man" (a wrecker) be given the death penalty due to his reputation as an explosive maker.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old Jane and Jenny twins in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other conspirators nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs. Corteen said, "He should be put in front of a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
Club Sari was levelled to the ground when a heavy charge placed outside a parked van was detonated shortly after 23:00 on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while kept alive, he “died to the doctors three times. ”
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jamá Islamiya responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas, and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like nobody else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, there just isn't.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others, not so much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
The arrest avoided nearly ten years, but was eventually caught in Pakistan's Abbottabad city in January 2011, where less than four months later, U.S. forces killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not voluntarily surrender," said Mrs Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can still appeal to the verdict.
FAA: Passengers in air transport can now use technological achievements on aircraft (but they must not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – in addition to calling from their cell phones – to read, play games, watch movies, and listen to music on the basis of the impatiently anticipated new rules published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
As quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to each airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA administration how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and device storage directives to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already passed the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"We can improve the widespread use of electronic equipment very quickly depending on the status of such a plan," the FAA said in its statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain gives permission.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane descends to land, and they turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their facilities during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA stated.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitude are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stevards, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
Frankly, we're tired of looking like "watchmen."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometres of altitude, said the agency.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with Friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, fired from American Airlines' aircraft because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored for fear that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transportation Safety, an expert on national transport security at CBS News, said mobile phones continued to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference in the air with broadcasting towers," Rosenker said.
In order to investigate this problem, he proposed last month that the government allow wider use of electronic equipment.
In recent years, the FAA has been under pressure to alleviate restrictions on its use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCaskillo, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget the obligation to shut down or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radios with them, the technical output of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also constructed, and approved by FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt under the new rules for the greater use of electronic equipment, says Huert.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasting than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimal broadcasts when turning the page.
But the transmission is stronger when devices download or transmit data.
Amazon.com is among those who are pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the transport aircraft with their electronic Kindle readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he was convinced that interference from these facilities was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee have stated that there are only fragmented reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause air system interference, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off equipment during instrument flying under low visibility.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and, according to it, it is a sensible procedure for the travelling public, which uses technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was delivered to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
A rattler was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after previously being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the Rescue Center until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: “This rattler probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught him over the North Sea. ”
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found refuge on an oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help. ”
By the time he was released, he was in good condition and well-being.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to join businesses and define the changes that British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in relation to the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnant.
They want to see how the government favors new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than getting caught up in a long and strenuous process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopolistic regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – even 40 percent of the large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, expressed their approval.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most explicit knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The finding, with which businesses of different sizes and major business groups have identified themselves, shows that the business sector is pushing for a “sense-of-change” that will shift back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% in a referendum for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports its plan to amend the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and, given the fact that the euro area is on its way to a closer economic and fiscal union, it is becoming increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and, as the results of our survey show, it means a refocus on business and a major change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry confessed: Spying went too far!
The United States has occasionally gone "too far" in spying, according to the AFP agency, U.S. diplomacy chief John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, however, the gathering of information served to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington", according to AFP, was heard in the midst of a heated polemic on both sides of the Atlantic due to scandalous data-watching revelations by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the target of which was American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as did President (Barack Obama), some of these events have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he advocated the past practice.
According to him, gathering information is essential for the fight against terrorism and preventing assassinations, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, the Madrid assassinations in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to be informed of the plots in time," Kerry emphasized.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went excessively far".
The affair surrounding American intelligence, which reportedly followed hundreds of millions of telephone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that Americans were tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone as well.
Europe's leaders did not hide outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to prohibit or significantly limit monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The launch of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, say officials.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.
As soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction in other countries is to start in the direction of flow at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They're in for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the mountainous region of Kalamoon.
According to the ever-clarifying reports, Israel destroyed Hezbollah's missiles in Wednesday's raids on two locations in Western Syria.
This Lebanese Shia organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the local army.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere with Syria’s conflict, but clearly said that it will prevent the transfer of armament to Hezbollah’s hands to Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday Israeli raids on weapons warehouses in Western Syria have yet to be specified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to Syria's Dampress.com website, missiles fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latákí.
Al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses were hit, in which the missiles were ready for transport to Lebanon.
According to its sources, it was Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Jishai said Syria continuously tries to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force teaches members of the armed section of Hezbollah to handle the missiles.
The SA-8 are outdated missiles that have had the Syrian army since the 1980s.
They are placed on a movable chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, mobility and small proportions make it easy to hide them.
They're equipped with radar, but they shut down after firing the missile, so it's hard to lock on to them.
Latakiya lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by ruling aldermen.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has participated in the fighting in Western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shia community to which the alavites belong.
Now, supposedly 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help conquer the army back to Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, his troops are also strengthening the Syrian army there.
Kalamún lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
The battle is to be retaliated according to al-Arabiya's source for the recent opposition attack on Syrian Shia Brigade headquarters abú Fadla Abbas in the Shia part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to fight back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many insurgents from Kusajr just left for Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, squandering money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals have been cited as reasons.
According to the results of the election, it can be concluded that most citizens were comfortable with this condition.
That they didn't really mind and were actually satisfied with the condition that was there (the theft and debt of this state).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not come to the elections, 596,357 voters voted for TOP 09,384,174 voters voted for ODS in total, so 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is the absolute majority.
When I add 1,016,829 ČSSD voters to the above parties, then with the old order (because all the above parties participated in "stealing" and indebtedness of this state), 64.23% of rightful voters actually agreed to this condition.
In fact, most voters have shown that they are not for the punishment of the culprits robbed and overdebted by this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who participated in this will enforce appropriate laws?
Is there any way we can be helped?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) had been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Child Sexual Abuse Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of child sexual abuse before being charged against child tutor Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011.
But before the commission, it was said that in its opening statement to the commission, this association stated that they had never solved a child sexual abuse case in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case where one of YMCA's employees was accused of child pornography offences, and another when a gym teacher in Caringbah from YMCA was convicted of sexual harassment of children he had in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, a committee advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which valued this organisation as a leading advocate of children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission refers to the fact that YMCA has been warned that it received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the August audit of the Ministry of Education and Society.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA Association when he was 21, admitted that the management of the YMCA itself downwards failed to accept Mr. Lord without making sure that the personnel were aware of the obligation to report breaches of the child safety rules.
Previously this year, Lord was convicted of sexually harassing 12 boys he committed during the two years he worked at the YMCA Association.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented personnel from reporting a child safety breach by Mr. Lord.
Staff members provided evidence that they witnessed such violations, including the Lord being alone with the children, keeping them private, letting them sit in his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of services to children in the YMCA association in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was “very intimidating and often difficult to discuss with him".
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the staff, that they felt uncomfortable if they were to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord clouded their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said that the YMCA Council in New South Wales had informed its view that the lesson from the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organization was that the staff "did not report", and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations appeared was made by General Service Manager at YMCA by Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid disruption of evidence, but it was “excessly zealous” and badly executed.
A child sexual abuse specialist Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that was safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, vetting, incorporating, training, and managing personnel.
The hearing was adjourned on December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, 59-year-old politicians expressed their views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the lead position, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the Bizkood Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, his reply was quoted by the London Evening Standard as follows: “Yes, of course, but it may be hard to do that, so..."
While crowds of horse-showing experts were gathering in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize, it was clear to all that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet going to school and only a few months ago took his first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, seamlessly trotted through three laps to eventually win the main prize and left behind 30 towing adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – at the same height – was praised at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Riding Centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff for appearance, behaviour and style.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret into a cheerful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given his third birthday in March and has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony ever since.
His mother Donna (30) said: “Fenton and Toffee work well together. ”
They did not get high hopes, but eventually left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone considered him phenomenal and completely foreign people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales follows in the footsteps of her aunt Sharon Howells, who parades horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded. ”
He ran across the sand all along the length of the arena and, although it worked so small, gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors, and a farm, and he has two chickens in charge.
Since he started, he'll be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show show contest said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony. ”
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the pony and the leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped him. He really did fit in with him.
Too inquisitive a newspaper to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which, on the front page, requested the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, said the press administrator.
The New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a society partially owned by the state.
The administrator said that the New Express newspaper will now perform a “full remedy.”
The regulation on "repair" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guang-tung Province.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express newspaper from the Yongcheng group Evening News issued several false reports of the said company Zoomlion.
"New Express newspaper editorial management was disorderly," the administrator said in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to impose administrative punishment on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the cancellation of the journalistic license".
He also “ordered the Yongcheng group Evening News to carry out an overall New Express correction, recommending that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the New Express leadership".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express concerning financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being detained, his newspaper issued two applications for his release on the front page, claiming he was behind his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to publishing false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion as well as to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he said at the state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I've done wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express released an apology on the front page, stating that he failed when he failed to carry out sufficient control of his reports.
Recently, the confession has made several closely monitored suspects on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the amendment to this year's law, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel was found to smuggle drugs between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad.
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric rails, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel measuring roughly one by one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of nearly six football courses, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of vague warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also intercepted eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of convictions, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate large-scale drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which puts a problem before drug cartels as quickly as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres in length equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and Center connect management.
They offer, for example, joint advertising
Economia's new integrated newsroom in Prague Karlín.
Economia took the next step to transform the Centre holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and Centrum have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and of the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," Vice-Chairman of the Board of Economics commented on the changes made and appointed CEO Kamil Čermák.
The kermák, who will be at the forefront of unified management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Holdings Centre Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Voparil was appointed as the new joint director of the store, to whom the advertiser of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová is subordinate.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editorials is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team also includes the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was assigned the newly established position of marketing director.
The independent branch of corporate communication is newly managed by Věra Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishing houses is led by Petr Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the production of content of all issued titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract to purchase Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuálně.cz, žená.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of other almost twenty smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly Respekt and Economia and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This June, the label moved to newly built modern premises in Prague Karlín.
CME's targeting the TV business.
They'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The media group CME will be dismissing.
By the end of the year, he wants to slump a thousand people.
He's going to cut off all the side activities, and all he wants to do is focus on his major business, the television broadcast.
The group, which owns Nova television in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4 500 people.
Almost a quarter of the people lose their jobs.
The media group operates televisions in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is the company CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech versions of MTV music stations.
How much savings will touch the Czech Republic, where the group employs roughly 650 people, and what this will mean for the Czech TV number one TV Nova is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really can't comment," said Nova Communications Director Josef Koukolík.
According to the information of MF DNES, significant redundancies of the Czech Republic will not be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the staffing of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined after longtime director Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a Wednesday conference call with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of production of its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
The cooling tower burned down in the industrial complex ČKD in Prague at night
In the industrial complex ČKD in Prague burned large-capacity reservoir, according to firefighters apparently cooling tower.
"Firemen started the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, they finished catching up on the fire this morning," said Prague fire spokesperson Pavlína Adamcová.
The amount of pollutants in the air around the area according to measurements did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the Kolbenova street complex.
"This is a large-capacity storage tank fire, probably cooling towers," Adamcová said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing using a transport line from tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing of the poorly functioning hydrant network complicated the fire department, so the fire department had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The head of the fire department's intervention has declared a second stage fire alarm.
The scales are four in total, the fourth is declared in the most serious situations.
The chemists set off to verify the level of hazardous substances that could have been airborne during the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the atmosphere that would exceed hygiene standards," said the fire department spokesperson.
The British police delivered an extradition notice to Assange
The British police delivered today a release announcement to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that he had delivered a "issue announcement" to a 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not do so, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange under British law exhausted his options when the Supreme Court cancelled his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden due to sexual crimes charges.
As he feared Stockholm would give him up to the US, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard “provided a release announcement to a 40 - year - old man who was asked to come to the police station on the day and hour that was assigned to him, ” said a spokesman.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face allegations of espionage because he posted 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for riding up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) of the town of Tiptree, Essex was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a cup of drinks between his thighs.
At the Colchester Howie Police Court, he confessed to the charge that he was driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month ban on proceedings.
Howie was also ordered to cash the cost of £90 and the premium for the accused £100.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts.
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the return on financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborn, who presented in the 2012 budget a fee of 7% for the transfer of real estate to buildings over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals.
The revenue from the property transfer fee in the housing fund in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in the 2012/13 tax year reached £708 million, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “It is very difficult to argue that high value property is undertaxed regardless of the effect of an outdated tax system, given the increase in property transfer at high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is taxed.”
He added that “this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy properties in London, or that existing owners are reluctant to sell".
The front real estate – between 5% and 10% of the housing market by price – in a rich belt dating from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw a record increase of 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London continue to show steady growth of 5.6% from year to year, but were overshadowed by a booming ‘home market’, on which, according to a survey by the real estate agency Savills, Southwest, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) added.
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are related to the dog’s mood
Earlier research showed that happy dogs wriggle the tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wave the tail mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can record and respond to these subtle differences in tail movements.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known for people that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that give positive or negative emotions. ”
The same thing we tried to observe in other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs react to the asymmetric tailing of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and another to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs films about dogs – whether in a natural version or in the form of silhouettes – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the tail movement and depict it more on the right or left."
When animals saw an otherwise bland dog move its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), it remained perfectly calm.
However, when she recorded tail filming mostly to the left (again from the dog's view of the wagging tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs were consciously communicating through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what moves they must and do not need to look out for.
He said: “If you encounter dogs several times, and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior, and the movement of the right produces less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers understand their animals’ emotions better.
Dog Behavior Expert John Bradshaw, a college veterinary teacher at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads on the left as they watch an aggressive dog, and on the right as they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another professional treatise from Victoria University, Canada, he said: “Doggy robot was more likely to be familiar with dogs when they wrangled their tail left than right, when they became more uncertain – quite the opposite of the Italian study."
According to him, the difference can be due to the fact that dogs in these different studies did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots entirely as dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs react to real dogs might help.
"Although there are strong evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it may not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and another to the other.
Arctic Monkeys because of Alex Turner's illness moved the gig in Glasgow
The rock band Arctic Monkeys shifted the gig in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with larynxitis.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
The illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after she was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's appearance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s appearance in the LG arena in Birmingham and on the basis of medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys Group must postpone the appearance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to perform."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will thus take place on November 20 and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets to these appearances remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to everyone who bought tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.
If you need more information, please contact customer service at the box office where you bought your tickets.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis, on February 22, would first appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The Cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope, and are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis appoints his first group of men who will eventually help to select his successors.
There are now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the Pope’s election – the group thus shrinks to 120 electoral cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the ceremonial promotion of the new cardinals, a gathering of contemporary cardinals known as the Consistory will be held.
"The Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require Cardinals from various parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals would likely fall by February.
He said that the Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of electorates again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a certain focus on Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose task was to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope made all his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was “quite possible” that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
But we weren't in this situation before – it's totally new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises—so we don't know who he names".
GM withdraws some new light trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backs
According to Friday's announcement from the U.S. Car Safety Authority, General Motors withdraws nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to repair the malfunction with manual tilting of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may have a fault.
As a result, seat backs are not in line with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
The announcement placed on the Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) website says that “if the car gets hit from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the passenger, increasing the risk of injury".
The downloaded models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the delivery in June, and for this leading American car company, the most important issue is the marketing of vehicles from the restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the delivery of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcement to owners due to the 16-day dysfunction of the government, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
Sales of supplies to Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to USD 37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperate Shout of Obama’s Voter
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have undermined the obstruction of the Republican Party
Obstructive policy cannot justify the woes of Obama's health care website or drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris studies medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would encourage me during my second year's gloomy days at medical school and restore a little hope in me.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and these are memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming superiority, and television coverage forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept the newspaper they got.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During his entry into office in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I threw in my first ballot, there were really changes.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the law on available care through the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy "not to ask questions, not to say anything" after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, public choice of health care and closure of the base in Guantanamo.
But after many situations when I defended my colleagues and friends from the Obama administration, I reached an absolute limit on the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
The obstructions of Republicans cannot explain their consent to eavesdropping on foreign leaders, or to air raids of unmanned aircraft that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives, nor that it pursues those who expose the government’s misdemeanors.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without due process, or for reducing public contributions and expenses during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, they cannot justify the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on the available care of a simple website.
I don't know if you could expect something like that.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the elected function has no predictable course, and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above appear to a large extent to be the result of the administration's own decisions.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncut alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we once heard of.
Yet the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
They make me remember that line of promises that went missing.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered an overwhelming defeat with Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to his pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over the parental leave program
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Mining tycoon, who runs a dispute over the payment of $6 million worth of coal tax, made this claim as he tried to throw the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate that play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
"He was in a big conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave because if either of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election of the Electoral Commission, after recalculation of votes, Mr. Palmer officially declared himself a winner in the fight for the seat as Fairfax District in the Sunshine Coast area by winning 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the election rooms are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap details on the computer, vote immediately, and get results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, you can erase the results if someone doesn't like them?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Election Commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political program also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
The public office is a public service.
"We do not seek any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands will change your mind.
98 people participated in the experiment, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an unsolvable task.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed their hands in failure made a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the band "washed hands" did better in the next test than the other.
Still, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not have them washed.
The results of the "maturated" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which had not recorded any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the test results indicate that physical cleanness removes truly negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivation decreases, but the testers need to concentrate much more in the next test.
If we were to transfer the research results to the Czechs, we would probably be most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but on the way by public transport it is already one fifth.
In hygiene, 85 percent of people are also attached after working in the garden or in the workshop, where they wash their hands.
pet caressing motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, to what extent it is necessary to wash your hands after a handshake to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Though it would be appropriate, I'm afraid reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," commented skin doctor Claudia Komárková on the results of the survey.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities regarding suspected currency-market machinations is becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with competent authorities in investigations into the largest financial market in the world, where each day they change owners of USD 5.3 trillion.
The two traders mentioned would be the first employees of RBS suspended in the framework of an expanding investigation, which responds to the LIBOR tariff manipulation scandal (London interbank interest rate).
The bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our ongoing search continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event said that RBS handed the UK Financial Behavior Authority records of e-mails and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of a former merchant.
This businessman, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European Chairman of Cash Trading in Citi, took a leave of absence this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former head of currency trade in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders was charged with any offense.
Mr Usher's Rapid News Group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said people consecrated to this event.
UBS stated this week that after the Swiss control authority Finma announced that it had investigated suspected foreign currency machinations in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six offices – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are investigating claims that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse initiated internal investigations or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks comb through years of fast news and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that was one of the largest profit-making engines in investment bank closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation when they claimed that it is essentially impossible to manipulate a large and highly liquid foreign currency market, but high-ranking traders say that this may not necessarily be true.
A high-ranking businessman said that, despite the considerable volume of day-to-day trading in foreign currency, liquidity scrapping between various trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released its trader stock trading department this week, which had caused a loss of nearly USD 6 million in late last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem was resolved," Credit Suisse said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have registered over a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of monitoring in 1986 to the end of this year's third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This results from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, there were 2,063 infected in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the immune failure disease has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased annually in the last decade.
In 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new diseases and then in 2010 180.
The number dropped to 153 a year ago, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, in my opinion there is no doubt," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavtý, who ran the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, tests revealed contagion in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavtý.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
HIV tests confirmed 1710 males and 353 females from early follow-up to late September.
AIDS disease erupted in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Who really wants to meet a town, should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk to the city center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he would reveal the box.
Many people "read from graves".
The cemeteries wander slowly and gain intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what faiths they are, how large and cohesive families they belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
In what way they express their social position, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they find out how the survivors take care of their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama’s Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the Constitution, a crucial victory for the Obama administration.
With a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Available Care Act – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they threaten to pay a fine – does not contradict the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
Court chairman John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remaining parts of the 2700 site law and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which requires states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise threatening the elimination of all funding of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises filed a lawsuit to block this law.
During the 2012 primary, the bill strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the presumed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a limping donkey" no longer a prison, the court has abolished the law
Up until now, Zimbabweans had to be careful how they spoke in public about the nine-eighty-year-old Mugab who ruled the country since the early 1980s, and since the end of 1987 he has been at its forefront.
According to section 33 of the Criminal Law, a $100 fine was threatened with a prison sentence of up to one year for the abuse of the presidential office.
"State representatives should not be eagerly accusing people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court stated.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines the freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, informing the British BBC.
Against the law, a number of damaged Zimbabweans were loudly defined, among them Tendai Dang, whom police arrested two years ago for alleged insult to the President in an argument with a policeman in a bar.
In May, the opposition activist in public Mugabe ended up in prison with the swearing of "the limping donkey".
In August, the prosecutor then accused a 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared the unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove false," said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe law has allowed a person who discloses false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing criminalizing someone for a false statement has a freezing effect on the right to freely express itself," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has been ruling the country with hard hands for over 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Little steps away from the dictatorship of one man of the country took place in 2009, when an agreement between Mugab and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the Prime Minister's seat.
Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only currencies of other countries are paid in Zimbabwe.
The impoverished economy goes to Mugabe's inconsiderate agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience in running the farm.
Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that allows banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It's a very sensible move," Julian Callow, London's chief international economist, Barclays, commented.
"So far all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is no surprise to me," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the bonds that began in 2007, when the international credit market first choked.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its support program for the US economy, which could drive out the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used by default to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency is at the same time being exceeded.
It can be understood as a repository of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB launches a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on bank supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration at Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish it, because someone at the branch was sitting who couldn't complete the Internet registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and that changed my address and my ID number.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn't, because I had another number of OPs, an address and that I just couldn't finish it and that I had to apply for data deletion and make a new registration.
That is what I did, and I wrote on technical support on 24.10.2013 that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable Data Protection Act.
For that, she wrote me a technical support report that I should finish my registration at the branch.
Thus began the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where they finally wrote after 4th Urgance 25.10. that personal data had been deleted at my request.
So one would think that he could make the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my user name was already occupied (the understanding was not deleted - this is not a personal information, but eventually they also disabled this).
So I used a different user name and jumped out of my mind that my personal data was already stored to complete registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that claims they deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
On my question, how could it be that my personal data has actually been deleted on 25.10. and to send an e-mail with the error?
That's what I did (about 15 o'clock yesterday) and they texted me back today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why I can't because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been in contact with technical support for a week and I am dealing with them that I still can't?
What does it matter that if what they claim (as it is not) is true, no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way, in the 13.22 I actually registered, in the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number and the world wonder, a page appeared to me that they sent me an e-mail link to complete the registration.
But how is that possible if you can't register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport tied the registration to an e-mail and phone number and data just didn't shut down as he claims.
So again, I have told this technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they are writing), because what they are writing is not true.
I've documented several screens that the registration problem was before 31.10. so "false" registration simply doesn't affect this.
For that, Tipsport wrote off a sentence - I'm sorry, but by being re-registered, we can't check your claim.
And he shut down the comms.
Respectfully, he repeats the same sentence over and over that registration is bound to name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so did not actually take place.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only didn't delete the data as he claims, but he's still lying when he says otherwise.
Even worse, it is possible to easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the error is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little bit in motion and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was handed over for verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and warning of the same mistake).
Music plays in the metro on the Bridge
The Prague Transport Company launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music is played continuously during underground operation, is the Bridge of Line A on the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Municipal Social House not only his completely new two-CD Czech Calendar, but mainly in the show Between us singers Lenka Nova, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by excellent Orchestra Matěj Benk.
After the opening intro and the acting etude about the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of the last time they played in Cologne and the theatre and the whole city was out of electric current.
"Otherwise, in Cologne, two types of cards were produced, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also recalled President Zeman's native.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but he had no idea about ice hockey at the time how we met in those squares and chanting, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play it here today," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this record for him a very suitable sleep in the day, singing at night and accompanied himself with her on guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little dredging into the hill of the heart, which immediately started the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," responded Michal Horáček.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, I recognize the performance of František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Hegerová recalled the composition Dad liked Lída Baarová and with Horacek's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar by American actress Mae West.
Composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the composition Sebastian, Segrado then sang a beautiful composition of Prague musicalized by Jarda Svoboda, Zásmucký native and former Kolíňák.
But that was the conclusion, standing ovation and additions in the form of optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
There was one more addition on the playlist, but the fans didn't clap.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček, her books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with any interested parties she took a photo.
Berdycha and Štěpánek will complement Rosol and Hájek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia was nominated by the unplaying Czech tennis player captain Jaroslav Navrátil to four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech representatives advocate the trophy, but they are going to play on the opponent's field at the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs have been in the finals for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we have to focus on our performance as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to earn three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the creator of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria is supposed to look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements they sent planes, they hit the target and returned.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire action and are no longer commenting on it.
The exact opposite of confused and big-mouthed, acts unsupported by Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the entire attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not be fooled by the media by their claims that the "Syrian base" or "deliveries for Hezbalah" were bombed.
I recently wrote here that while helping the U.S. secular insurgents in the country remains on a rhetorical level, Russia cheerfully continues to supply Syria's weapons.
And it was a fresh shipment of Russian missiles unloaded at the port of Latakija that became the target of an Israeli air raid.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel again bombed Assad's regime, not the rebels, although according to popular Internet theories it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has decorated two members of the special forces, probably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Bengazi.
She is known for the heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city, I believe they were members of a secret CIA commando made up of former soldiers.
For a long time, there was speculation as to what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the other CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has protected its office with machine gun nests in Libya (at just one such, both SEALs died after a mortar hit), is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two yet unknown heroes.
They were part of an American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received reports of an attack in Bengazi they volunteered to intervene and along with five private contractors shot their way to the CIA premises in Bengazi.
Obama's administration is baffled by the fact that during the attack, the commando was not deployed officially and the whole and that it was simply hesitant to do what to do.
Commander of the Commandant, so without orders, he'll probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that the country operates not once, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents, and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, there was no official confession, and even now it's just a NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the US, though half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although it would take much more help to solve the state-of-the-art situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media was almost chanting Iranian air force for prosecution of U.S. drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
However, if the Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft pursued an American drone in international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He underwent Phantoma to verify his armament optically without Phantom registering him on radar or simply noticing him and then suddenly appearing with him and challenging an Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed him without murmuring.
It is no wonder that Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but it remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful recently, the defender or midfielder Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to his representation after a year.
He also succeeds with shooters, debauchery, after the procedure he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached out in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but eventually took a single point out of these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break the unpleasant series in a match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a difficult match with the North Koreans, who play offensive football.
Everything leads to a match with Jablonec, coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative attracts fans to the Doosan Arena grandstands.
Plzni's last matches did not go as she would have liked, but the word of the crisis is rejected by defender Victoria.
That's how football works, sometimes you're in good shape, and sometimes you're worse.
But there's no way I'd be talking about a crisis.
"I believe we're going to win on Friday and it's going to be all right," says Western defender.
The Victoria team will once again rely on fan support.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big jump - a few years ago, in memory, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash the dishes, vacuum out and do your homework.
Although these "obligations" were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running out of school, throwing the bag in the corner and running out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump a drink.
Then during the series Helena and her boys embroider the ceremonial tablecloth for Grandma's birthday with a chain stitch.
And then after a few times notice to finally wash the dishes, vacuum, in winter to carry wood to tile stoves and to do tasks after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of writing love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning to have a homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, whose content beside strawberries did not even lie down) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that Mom and I liked to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when it was grave silence in the room when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio to the tapes that were spinning loudly in the old tape recorder of my mom.
And then we rewinded the tapes on our pencil and played the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and we toasted it with a siphon.
Or we made a phone call across the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we're on the phone to hear ourselves better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, then the cleaner was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents managed to live in it so that we were not missing anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "thread" in the closet was a batified homemade T-shirt with the help of SAVA.
From electronics, we were satisfied with Mom's tape recorder and most of all Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we only used on a train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said, go "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure my parents have been saving for him for a long time, but unfortunately he hasn't warmed up in our house for a long time.
My little sister shoved a strudel into it, said he was eating those tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if she could eat a strudel.
Unfortunately, he did, but it was his last bite.
Well, to this day, poor thing still has this story on her plate from my dad.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put strudel into the video and thought she would play the recipe and not play it, so she still can't bake it.
I remember how we could all communicate, communicate without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I agreed on holidays with my neighbor's granddaughter, when we will meet again next summer at Grandma's - and that was the case, that was the case.
We met.
Promise to see someone next year?!
I also remember the winter when we used to run around with the whole village, build snowmen, ride a snowy hill by the church on sacks of stuffed hay.
Then we had dinner together with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear that notorious phrase before every dinner, "Let's wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have lemon-tied soap in your bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad worked in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, leaned our feet against the tiled stove, opened the door and watched the flame and listened to the crackling of wood pouring from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, texts.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I complete these memories by viewing albums where black horns are neatly glued to black and white photos.
And in case I don't know how old I was back then, the pictures are always written a year to take a picture.
I look at the fact that the cups didn't suit us very well, and we had our cousin's pants two times bigger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better get back to that step forward - to reality.
By 2013 and I'll wait to see what the modern times will come up with for my children.
What I do know for sure is that these memories of me are now, for a young teenage generation, at least somewhere "hundred years behind monkeys" and I think they're missing a lot, that they won't experience this "pre-ape" time either.
I wish they could!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the defunct Nortel company, filed a lawsuit on Thursday for patent violations against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company that was relicitated at the Nortel auction as part of the bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which purchased Nortel's US$4.5 billion patents, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations at the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link the terms sought on the Internet to the relevant advertising, stating the lawsuit, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that work on Google Android's operating system that strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a default USD 900 million bid for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to 4.4 billion USD.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for USD 12.5 billion, which was partly motivated by the Motorola patent group.
"Despite the failure to obtain patents which are the subject of the dispute in the auction, Google violated and continued to violate patents," the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation from Google because, according to it, the patent is intentionally breached by Google, as claimed by the lawsuit.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came from outside, from 4 degrees Fahrenheit, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put off her smile, the one she kept on putting on display as a defense from the wannabe friendly surroundings.
She was so relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was only honest at home on the days when she was grandmothers and had grandchildren Elinka or Adík around her.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered very well the lesson from the endless courses of business skills.
Now they're finally really useful.
So she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a costume for a costume.
November, or another month, can't do the miracle to make her smile really, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn't been here in almost three years.
Egypt puts the first freely elected president in office
Muhammad Morsi took an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day hardly ends the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised “new Egypt” when he was inaugurated as the first freely elected president of that country, following Husní Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his entry into office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges dressed in black robes in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for better tomorrows, a new Egypt and the other Republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer graduated in the US and a Muslim Brotherhood member, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11pm local time in a small motorcade, hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pompousness of the Mubarak period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column could pass through the usually busy route connecting the city center with the suburbs in the south.
Morsi's personal prestige, mockly referred to as the uncharismatic "reservative tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also to all those who want to end the revolt against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state," Morsi said dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie judge in a wood-covered chamber where he took an oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University where he was to give an inaugural speech.
While standing at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
Present was the military commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was accompanied by chanting of the “armada and the people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as the center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a revolution was born last year that ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and solemnly promised to take back the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took over from the expelled leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, as is customary, he has yielded to the will of the army, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll probably be police specialists in the ghettos to ease the tension.
Police specialists should be active in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from nearby.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior is counting on this.
According to him, "accelerated social housing security" would help to improve the situation in the country.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 slums and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, especially Romani people.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It was usury.
According to the experts of the troubled localities, it has increased by a hundred.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are intensifying.
In several places, anti-Romani marches were held.
Extremists were also joined by people from nearby.
According to the interior, it is difficult for police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
The fundamental condition is said to be "the consistent application of an equal approach in law enforcement".
But this is said to be impossible to achieve without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
"Thanks to established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of infringements," the internal said.
Ghetto specialists would receive extras, up to 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into troubled areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (about 15,5 million crowns now).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, 85 percent of the funds.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project is scheduled to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors of the report reported.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also matter how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the design of the project, selected police officers first undertake an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should pass this training each year.
They'll make the most suitable candidates.
Special education should also be created for police officers who will operate in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It is said to motivate and lead to integration.
According to interior ideas, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet the hostel with precise rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards would have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to fulfill an integration plan that social workers would have compiled with them.
They would have to follow the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain, and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would have advanced to a higher standard of housing.
The permeable housing system should operate for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation "in a pro-integration motivated environment" grows.
The social housing model is prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They're supposed to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The coal hill is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jesenik at a time (geologically speaking) recent.
The last eruptions were still here at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, on the top of the Uhlířské vrch is a prominent white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady Auxiliary, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church was not preserved.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley was planted from four rows of lip, about 1 km long.
The cross road on the Uhlířské vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
On fifteen stops are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver František Nedomlel.
He used various species of wood from the Low Jesenik area.
Similarly, the pedestals from rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop includes the name of the sponsor.
The coal hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements of age vary somewhat, the last eruption was here about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venus's volcano (age 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
In it, she cast out a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the base, which by burning it had acquired a red-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption ejected red, brown-red, and in places up to black tufas.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the quarry wall.
In tufes there are conspicuous volcanic pumas up to 1 meter large. The second eruption was ended by lava discharge.
At the conclusion of the activity from the volcano flowed lava, which today forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of stucco basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate the ejection of volcanic ash with lava discharges are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name stratovulkanas.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subject to erosion.
However, he was threatened by mining rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tufy was added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under pressure from both experts and the public, mining managed to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and small cohesion of rocks, which rapidly weather, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
The quarry disappears quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are kept to a number of important locations.
You can reach the Uhlířský Hill on the green tourist trail from Bruntál or from Silesian Kočov.
Automobilists can use an unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the lime alley, where a short educational trail begins.
From the villa, she moved into the building.
Ivana grew up and spent much of her life in a tenement villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful residential buildings in Prague on Ořechovce.
However, the original owners of the house recovered it in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance pay.
Ivana quickly sought replacement housing for herself and her then older mother.
From the acquaintances she received a tip on apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the extensive forest park and dam excited me on the other hand," Ivan recalls the first impression.
At first, I thought it'd be a makeshift for, like, three years.
"Today we have been living here for more than 13 years and not only for the sake of a gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a 200-foot apartment to a smaller apartment with a surface of 62 m2 and gave away almost all equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting doors or changing windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most uncomfortable with the impractical and unnecessary large hall, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used gypsum to define individual zones and break down the gypsum room, which allowed the new location of the lights.
The first intervention she decided to take after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the apartment's layout to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improve the standard was replacing the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn't know what to do with the bathroom.
For years, I took magazines about housing and looked for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So, on recommendation, I approached young architect Kamila Douděr.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the available hall.
The architect connected the toilet and bathroom space and two doors with opening wings replaced one sliding, saving the space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in addition there is a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower in the drawer.
Successful collaboration with Kamila Doudér continued.
As part of the "How to Build a Dream" programme, the living room was transformed quickly but fundamentally, which was also attended by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping into the space, which was created by connecting two smaller rooms, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, for example by half-crosses or Japanese walls.
"This would in the end violate the openness and unity of space," the architect explains.
The sleeping and living areas were originally separated.
All you had to do was turn your back on two sofas and put a tailor-made blanket cabinet between them.
The dining area is defined by shades of floor and paint.
On the kitchen floor and dining area, the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived with a wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette, if necessary, covers sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new antiallergic marmoleum floor has many advantages compared to the previous laminate: a softer non-slip surface and better sound insulation.
The system of gypsum and gypsum ceilings highlighted in color is a demonstration of how the space can be worked in the panel.
I left the colors to the architects, I wished it was happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," Ivana says.
The tile from the graphoglass with the motif of the blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were stored, among other things, in the space under window windowsills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably operated at a distance.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new one with the older one works excellently, for example with a ten-year-old crystal chandelier and quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The kitchen came last.
The lockers were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took their number and rearranged the layout.
Furniture in simple design is custom made, the white surface softens the slightly pearly surface.
The small space was equipped with an imaginative solution of washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the whole glass cladding of the walls above the worktop.
Unique graphoglass with digitally printed motif is attractive, plus it is well maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood she lived in for years.
Now she seems satisfied here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and sink, into the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiling.
The large shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create from a given environment a clear simple space in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We united the interior materially and in colour and attempted its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
"Another condition for entering was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the availability of daily items," adds Kamila Doudářová.
The Supreme Court ruled: Time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, he ruled that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they waived their term of office last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the court rejected the motion of Iva Ištnut, who wanted to continue criminal proceedings with MPs.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandates and not making problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to continue to prosecute the former Prime Minister, who offered them these posts.
With Vít Bárta, an officer of the Anti-Corruption Police has also been detained
Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said, "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but I can't comment on this in the light of the protection of classified facts."
According to information rights the case is solved by the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS).
The server tn.cz reported that Barta could have bought classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police President Petr Lessy, whom he allegedly sought to appoint as Bárt.
However, the latest information Rights show that the detention of Vít Barta does not relate to Peter Lessy.
Police Presidium spokesperson Eva Kropáčová refused to comment on the case being dealt with by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," Štěpánka Zenklová said to the Attorney General in Prague on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there who oversees Bart's case, and her words thus indirectly indicate that the file or criminal proceedings are being conducted under a covert regime.
Reporter Newek managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta Kateřina Klasnova in the morning before their residence in Prague Klaárov.
She was just loading her bags in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement Tomio Okamura commented on Bart's detention.
According to his words, he has no idea what's going on in the case.
"Welcome to Bárta was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the election, he was neither a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement Tomia Okamura in the past early elections to the House of Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of bribing Members of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was immaculately sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Subsequently, the sentence was changed and Barta was acquitted.
Sleep: I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospěla, the family was always in first place, which is why they want to fully submit to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he's definitely done with hockey.
"I want to fulfill the role of father and husband."
"I look forward to it," says a hockey player who is still in vain waiting for an offer.
Despite being a notorious hard worker who never cheats anything.
Despite leaving his heart on the ice every time, he can tear down his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus's most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still," they say.
He may find himself, supposedly wanted by the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and, moreover, have injured two supporters - the attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like coming to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that should be signed, but that's it.
Nowhere else has it been delivered that really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but I just don't.
You haven't heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
It's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it and the manager doesn't step.
There's a lot of different factors that need to come together to get the contract.
But in New York, circumstances like this happen, don't they?
The injured is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan, and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The other thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to work?
I've had those expectations since July 5, when the free player market opened up in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and to seeing you again.
Do you have your schedule planned?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and everything depends on that.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna do the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
As early as Sunday, Vášek has two hockey matches, it is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in full-time quotes?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This could happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 knee-surgery games.
And I was really, really enjoying it.
One day it gets to a stage where all goals, wins, and passes don't make up for what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the point of life.
Whatever job you have.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have happened to me besides family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, first place - apart from family - is sport success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life depends on.
My children, sorry, our children - mine and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we'd really like them to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell each other, in America, there are possibilities somewhere else.
We should offer them that chance.
So are you planning on staying in America permanently?
We're going to practice this as far as we can.
This means that in summer we will be in Bohemia in Hluboké and in the surroundings of České Budějovice.
And in the winter, back in Tampa or wherever our steps lead us.
It's perfect to be warm all the time.
I've been so lucky in my life.
You could say that I went across from him, it took a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want to do this so they can choose what they're going to do and how they're going to live.
How long will you have the will to work, train hard at your age, and wait for an offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell how much longer it's gonna stay there.
You can't plan that.
So you can say you wait this season to see how it turns out and then you decide what to do next?
I'm in a phase where I go day by day.
Recently, CEZ CEO announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th block of the Temelín power plant was postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and approving Contracts of Difference by the government.
With these reasons CEZ's current management tries to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should make recommendations to the shareholder, not hide behind him.
Babiš: Government only with Sobotka.
Andrei Babiš is beginning to reconcile that his YES movement will not have time to learn a political trade in opposition and that he will have to go straight to government to form one at all.
The president of the YES admitted this in an interview for the Law that will come out tomorrow.
Business and marketing SkoFIN is led by Abraham
Its competences include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
In office, he replaced Luděk Shantora.
Abraham has linked his professional career to the automotive sector for the past 14 years.
He served in Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealer for seven years.
His last assignment was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
SkoFIN was created in 1992.
Police evacuated a portion of Los Angeles airport due to the shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, reportedly it was Terminal Three.
Reuters agency, with reference to California media, claims the lawmen were shot with a gun from an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to police, reported that there was a shootout in which two to three members of the Transportation Safety Administration were injured.
How many people have been injured in total and whether there are any victims but it is still not obvious.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more casualties.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakiya on Thursday.
With reference to an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN TV announced it.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli army, when asked by CNN, refused to comment on information about the raid.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
According to the U.S. government's source of rockets and related equipment, Israelis believe the Israelis could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP agency, with reference to another U.S. security officer, reported that the target of the Israeli raid on Syrian territory was the Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel’s second channel reported that the target of the attack was reportedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, but according to the DPA agency, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Nova rockets.
In addition, they reportedly saw a battery of SA-3 missiles including a command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to Israel’s television report, recorded missiles have a range of 35 kilometres and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile supplies inside Syria at least twice this year, reported CNN and AP.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed that it will intervene in any shipment of weapons designated by Hezbollah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to have successfully resisted this trend.
The company updated the estimate of annual profits and expects record profits from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The Agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to range between USD 325 and 340 million, compared to USD 305 to 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12- to 17-percent increase against a record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an 8% profit in the first half of the year, and the second half began with sharp growth mainly in Australian and British travel away from business trips.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards record annual profits before interest and taxation," he said.
This is where Australia and the United Kingdom belong, which are traditionally our greatest profit makers.
The recreational activity business recovered during the second half of Australia, compensating for the slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly, in the UK Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
American trade recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year, and it is expected to yield a third year profit in a row.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia have been transported to St Petersburg
Ecological activists detained from September in Russia due to a protest against planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Saint Petersburg.
AFP informed about this today with an appeal to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She also claims that the original allegations of her piracy activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women, detained in Russia after non-violent action against an oil rig in the Arctic, were transported from Murmansk Correctional Facility to a prison in Saint Petersburg," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detainees are unclear; according to DPA, this was a planned move.
The environmental authorities first charged them with piracy, for which up to 15 years in prison in the event of conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace this charge with a milder disorderly act, for which there is a lower sentence with a maximum of seven years in prison.
Greenpeace, however, pointed out in today's statement that the charges of piracy have not yet been dropped by the authorities, as promised.
They say that means the detainees are now charged with two counts of crime.
The mighty Committee of Investigation announced last week that the allegations of piracy would be replaced by allegations of disorderly conduct.
But when 30 prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against everyone," AFP quoted from Greenpeace's statement.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody, against which they have filed an appeal, but the court has dismissed them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
The executive director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP, said today that moving to St Petersburg will facilitate meetings held with families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They may actually be worse," he pointed out.
One of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen asked the Dutch King Willem-Alexandra to help.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch invited him to discuss their situation in a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Máliki has a large part in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the struggles in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction will have to be studied in English literature lessons.
The test will also include a ‘hidden text’ to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English Literature and Language courses will be canceled.
As of 2015, students will be required to have a graduation exam from the language, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should release new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other major subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, who oversees graduation exams, reveals changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus regarding whether we need to reform our testing system to regain society’s trust” and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation exam be “more demanding, ambitious and more stringent.”
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison schools in Australia devote on average 143 hours a year to mathematics and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive graduation exam in mathematics – along with more emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards – will probably encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “the problems of the real world,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajinar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the election, a long-smoldering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD was fully lit.
Everything peaked when Ostrava Mayor Petr Kajinar turned to the court for the undemocratic compilation of candidates.
However, the actors of the case did not want to comment too much on this so as not to harm the party even more before the election.
But now the votes of the voters are numbered.
The management of Ostrava's ČSSD immediately on Monday evening called on the Mayor of Ostrava to step out of the party, and he will probably push to lose his office.
But Peter Kajinar wants to keep fighting.
What is involved in the disputes and who is on whose side he described in an exclusive interview for Diary.
How do you feel about the outcome of the election?
The ČSSD certainly counted on a much better result.
Was it damaging to us that there were disputes within the party in the media before the election?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which ČSSD is now in.
It's a party that has internal problems, it's internally ill, and people feel it's not all right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of ČSSD?
I think that ODS has been going through decline for some time, and things like this are now happening in social democracy.
It is that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS have moved on to the people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.
It is then related to the fact that police go around the offices of the City Hall of Ostrava and collect computers.
It shows that ČSSD is not just composed of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them mainly think of their good.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But that too has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foreboding of what is now happening in Prague.
Hakko's wing gradually occupied its positions so that, after the election, it could trigger a situation that weakens Sobotka's wing.
One is in a political situation where it is sometimes necessary to approach compromises.
But everyone has some kind of internal boundary where they can't compromise anymore, and that's my case.
Originally I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get on the regional candidate to strengthen Saturday's wing as Mayor of Ostrava.
But Hask's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on Bohuslav Sobotka's side and not Michal Hasek's?
In my opinion, Sobotka's fame is a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to some extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I'll admit I didn't hear anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can start dismissing the party's chairman.
This is a power struggle regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, what Michal Hasek has now done in Prague ended his political career.
How you perceived that the Ostrava ČSSD leadership did not approve you of the candidate.
Political parties are based on a competition to see who of their members sits.
The competition should be largely based on program visions and on these people's ability to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are people who do not have much ability or vision, but for them, the political party is an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start to come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruples, they break the party's statutes.
They make mafias of political parties by their practices and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kainnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Is that why you filed a motion before the elections for a preliminary measure against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of ČSSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by the fact that organizations that do not comply with it can abolish them, purposefully establishing new organizations, gradually throwing away uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to expel Richard Bednarík from the council club, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they preferred to lift the ruling on his expulsion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party's statutes through the courts is the last option, but at the time the other ways and control authorities within the ČSSD ceased to function, this is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD, headed by MP Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of Mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruba Lumir Pallyza has an interest in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza try to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, gain votes, and then for those votes, they consolidate their power in the party.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazala Stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could call me a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
In doing so, the town bought a property of strategic value to it.
So how do you feel about staying as mayor?
The District Committee already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our stay at the ČSSD.
But I think it's like when a thief screams, "Catch the thief!
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who initiates and promotes, sometimes even against party members, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of a science-tech park.
Still, everything's getting uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than getting in the way of other people going to the places they want.
Will you still fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is going to work well, political parties must work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to run the state effectively if they can't drive themselves.
So I'm not thinking of leaving the ČSSD now, because I don't think it's me that's causing cancer on this side, but these people who are trying to scare me out.
Olomouc opens in the historical center of the public rink
The organizer of Olomouc's Christmas markets and winter skating said that preparatory work on the rink was started on October 26 and an aggregate for ice production has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimetres thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Both skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stands.
"We have expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire surface of the podium is covered so that skaters can comfortably change their shoes," he described.
The street of Olomouc is already reminiscent of the coming Christmas.
Last year the rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square due to the repair of the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of City Hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched on Upper Square one month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlín will be remedied by the county court
The Regional Court acquitted the prosecutions of 25-year-old Slovak and 22-year-old Bohemia for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the guilt.
They're facing 15 to 20 years in prison or exceptional punishment.
Spokesperson Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court annulled the county decision and returned the matter to him again for consideration.
He refused to comment on the grounds which led to this from the judge that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the prosecution, the youngsters ambushed a seven-seven-year-old man in his house.
Senior died a tormented death.
According to the prosecution, the men strangled him, beaten him and kicked him all over the body and also with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, planted about three dozen blows to the head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures in the cranial bone, swelling of the brain or bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
Youngsters reportedly took some 3000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the county court, only indirect evidence against the defendants' scents, which the expert assessed as not entirely established in the sense of the statutory guidelines, were the only ones.
Although the scent marks from the crime scene and other matters coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as factual and not odorous clues.
In addition, some errors were found in handling them.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
Not even the emergency services doctor called for violent deaths.
Thus, only after a few days, detectives were contacted by Olomouc physicians who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the leads from the crime scene that the relatives cleaned up.
No DNA was recovered from the defendants at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradiště.
He is now serving a 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths who were responsible for the robbery of the jewelry store.
Robbery occurred in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of senior in Slopný.
Younger accused of murdering a senior resides in Uherské Hradiště.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo starts rebuilding the stadium
The reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo in early November.

The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the First Football League.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week's Autumn String
Saxophone giant and jazz scene legend Wayne Shorter will dot next Wednesday for the 18th Annual Autumn String Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Large Hall of Lucerna together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci, and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under Martin Kumžák.
In Shorter's edits for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus' new album Without A Net, as well as his older tracks Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert in the Autumn Strings will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music over 60 years ago.
The list of performers he collaborated with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he met Czech musician Miroslav Vituš and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade they set the direction of a new style of fusion.
He has been performing especially with Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past 13 years.
Some afterparty after the festival will be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, a Manchester trio Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska will introduce the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The ladies are said to prohibit UEFA from publishing sentences for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chair of the panel of judges of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing penalties for judges.
The UEFA rules forbid her, which she stated in an interview for the daily Law.
Otherwise, it is said that the FACR would be in danger of being punished.
Damková also refused to side with the footballers Pilsen, where she came from in her capacity.
These speculations are really senseless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in case of a vote, I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to criticism, which has been heated after Plzeň has recently played twice as much penalty as other league teams.
Thus, although in recent months the FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for referees, Damková assures that they are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds out that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever the match was," Damková said.
The reason why penalties are not published is, according to Damek, a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits publication of such information and severely punishes violations".
"We're very suspicious in our country and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have published limits, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop this, severe sanctions will come," Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If it continues to publish information, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not be fulfilling the arbitration program," Damková added.
The capture of Barta is related to Janoušek and Bem: Is it behind the leak of interceptions?
The President of Public Affairs of Vít Bárta was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Along with him, Jan Petržílek, head of the Department of Analysts and Informatics of Anti-Corruption Police, was detained.
The detention is related to eavesdropping on lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
News server.cz confirmed the information about the reports, with which news server News.cz, a trusted source confirmed the Czech Press Office.
Listened phone calls by Janouška and Béma, published in March last year by the daily Mladá Fronta Today, in which both men address each other as "Mazánek" and "Kolibík", show Janoušek's influence on the actions of the city under Bém's leadership.
The diary then stated that it was acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they escaped to the ABL Security Agency two years later.
That was owned by Bart at the time.
News server.cz pointed out that the detained criminalist Petržílek worked for BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption department, which subsequently dealt with the interceptions, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on protection of classified information, I can't confirm anything or say anything at all," said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was supervising the case.
It does not want to comment on the case for the same reason, nor does it want to comment on inspections.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six companies out of ten are intensively preparing for the impending effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act as of 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the firms’ representatives questioned said that they had not dealt with matters related to both key codes in their company at all.
This results from the survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which looked into the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In connection with the approaching date of effectiveness of the two key codes, at the last minute, many managers are beginning to realize the significant impact on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the laination of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty whether revolutionary changes will eventually take place or not.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left for the transition to new law to take place for their companies without complications," commented partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of the companies intensively involved in the new codes, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of the companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, every fifth firm has not yet dealt with recodification, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
In total, 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that the issues of recodification have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil code is for the largest number of companies questioned the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by a solution to business conditions (16 percent) and changes in the cadastre of real estate and liability (after 10 percent).
One of the most important innovations of the entire recodification will take place in contracts, namely unification of the contract regulation only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercial Code will cease, as a result of which contract law should become clearer for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many innovations with emphasis on greater freedom of relationship arrangement," said attorney Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Podadán.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies as the most important issue.
The topics concerning the changes in the assembly and the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent) follow.
The new legislation means strengthening the obligations and potential impacts for statutory bodies, especially when a company threatens to decline or becomes involved.
"In practice, this means that if board members and executives do not act with the care of a proper economy and do not avert the imminent decline of the company, they may not lose the benefits gained for the performance of their duties until the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier style develop as a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explaining in an interview for HN its position as Pierre Rainero, director of the Cartier style.
This French luxury house was founded in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team will treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the West African countries; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates for the CNN Heroes of the Year 2013 award.
In the CNN Heroes of the Year 2013 competition, you can vote for him or for any of the other ten main candidates.
The winner will raise $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father go unconscious again and again and goes to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital Yaounde in 1981.
At first, he was treated with only a broken hand, but subsequently developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there created a hematoma that caused him problems his whole life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years delivering his father to crowded clinics and hospitals where he received such a treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to get there first, but you're not first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just to compare, the ratio in the United States is one doctor to 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the healthcare expenditure in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy life with poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a physician vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a nonprofit organization ASCOVime, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their volunteer group.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people cram into vans, attach themselves to the roofs of medical supplies, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his broad smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in local fun.
The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document required by the school, but which many destitute families simply cannot afford.
The team is doing a simple surgery under local anesthesia tonight.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, in a town hall or at home; after surgery the patient wakes up and goes to a recovery site to make room for another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and sanitary equipment Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours.
It is exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay awake and continue working, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free operations last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said that after hernia surgery, he would be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says it is this second job that finances about 60% of its nonprofit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to raise money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students, such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it is a great practice they would not have obtained at home.
"We thoroughly washed our hands and removed blood stains or held his tools," says O'Malley.
You'll never experience that as a sophomore medical student in America.
Students volunteers usually pay their way to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive at Yaounde, food, transportation and study are provided by Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life, and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
Bwelle's constant struggle is not a burden.
Helping others live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to be doing this job," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain – that's why I do it.
Take a look at the ASCOVime website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát renewed the function of Principal Sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential for this function to be clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses, and I think he deserves to be given due attention by the Ministry.
It takes not only high professionalism but also a human approach and personal conviction to pursue this profession.
"I will gladly and with all responsibility try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients to carry out their summons with all empathy and help us improve the image of the nurses in the public's eyes," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Principal Sister for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová also stated on the occasion of her entry into office that she wants to deal with various aspects of the job position of a nurse and she intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I don't want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but I see them standing next to each other, with everyone having their responsibilities and, together with other health professionals, forming a coordinated working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from experience that some administrative tasks of the sisters are unduly burdened and taking away the time they could and should devote to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas to which it intends to focus include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve cooperation in the team and with the management of health service providers, adapting competences, as well as labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code, or not overloading nurses with their insufficient number in the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous homesicknesss, but because of concern about possible penalties, they are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Principal Sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and having the competent authorities examine the particular case," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study programme of Nursing - Education (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has served as Head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications at the Ministry of Education and Science.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at a bed in the internal department, also served as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009, she served as the main sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
♪ So I don't hate ♪
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After long years of reading, he lived but did not write, releasing VÁCLAV CAHUDA (1965) a new novel Wind, Dark, Presence.
The number of pages comparable to his most famous work, Houstina (Petrov, 2001) suggests that it will not be a thin volume.
For Salon Kahuda, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't hate myself.
To see the new and new clones of this human foolish pettyness, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I'm not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by powerless lust, a vassal soul, and oppositely over-pollinated ideologists trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a small selling whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jurodic friends, weirdos, and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of my life on this planet.
I like to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamppost tonight.
You're talking about feeling wasted, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break happened a long time ago, at about ten years old.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still a quiet boy in there.
I see other lonely drills, everyone in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved from writing books.
I'm taking part in this huge, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when by way of trial-accident another generation of beings arises, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or have you started from scratch?
Self - speaking, or better said, dialogue that is conducted by the right and left half of the brain, occasionally sails to the surface and forms into a book.
Like periods of peace interwoven with silently asleep metastases of wars, which may one day wake up - my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt a mute avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day it will quietly bury me.
It is a set of questions that the brain has formulated and places them to layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness".
The neocortex, the gray cortex of the brain, asks older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient year-rounds of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to clouds in the sky.
Yes, moral law in me and starry heaven above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you speak metaphorically of the ego - can you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to a constantly variable presence, in an unceasing attempt to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are congestion disorders.
Analogically - as if you had "falled" PC, from the speech emulator and translator program from foreign languages you would get confused first in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after several failed restarts ended in a dark green flashing Biosu screen, in a basic system that controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between processor and operating memory, etc.
For someone who has not yet understood what we're talking about - I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
Do you often mention her - why are you regularly interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In some of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling, and behavior, a breach appears.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He gazed into the abyss for so long, until the abyss looked into him."
A pure feeling - that man is lost, if all hope disappears, mentally "died" and the new quality begins.
And why do I care in person?
I will answer with a parable.
One once fell into the pool and drowned, days, months and years ran, he kept drowning and reading, and the books taught him how to swim - to live.
He's become a diver.
Perhaps a sentence written by me, as the Hrabal lyrics once did to me, will help someone.
To what extent do you think about the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
The one of whom nothing meaningful can be said, one calls it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word and sentence formulation."
From early youth he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine Captain Nema, running down the Shadows in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branching of authors and their messages, it reads: "The Sun of the Clear Worlds of Other Karl Hynek Mácha".
And when the book's out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On a retro-reflection that gets to you through people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read 500 pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are actually "life" or better said "worlds".
They are coded into letters, bearing experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can always wake them to life if we let their sentences flow to the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the publication of the book you - as it usually is - await a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like to read.
Will you be happy to do it again, or do you feel differently after years?
I'd rather just talk today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they're inconspicuous, they don't draw attention to each other, they have friendly radiations, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give you an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived was (and I hope he still lives) one curly bookshop (named conveniently Červenka), a cheerful fellow and a good girl's bull.
At one drinker, he introduced to me the individual articles of the strings of readers of my book The House.
I looked them in the eye and then I was shown a shredded, read copy of my book.
In embarrassment, I put down the jerry and wept briefly malely.
We all stood there silently, swaying and crying intoxicatingly.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't stand it, and he jumped head-to-head into a snowdrift.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night country and yawned happy with the rabies of the sensitive, sore souls of the countrymen and the woes of the lost patriots - howled and pampered like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and in substance different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, Darkness, Present?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts the words of an old Russian myth in the mouth of a folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog on it, a gray chest.
Horror, terror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
We may have been devils in hell a long time ago, drawing lots - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free influx of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depths and in such a breadth that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, of course, we do exactly in the depths of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes it becomes a disorder and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
That is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various faults, standing on the ocean coast unconscious and into a leaky sail made of a dirty handkerchief catches the tides of the watery wind.
I have to write to be human.
Obama retreats from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama stepped away from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With reference to hundreds of thousands of statements from Republican providers in recent days, the Republicans have accused the President of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday Obama bailed on his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called "disturbing in the media" about statements, Obama called on Americans who received these announcements to search for new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive healthcare program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the people who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Available Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans straight: you deserve better," said Sebelius in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Available Care Act, said that the launch of the Internet market has been "favourable" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Irritating Sebelius said this sentence, which was captured by the microphone, yesterday towards a counselor sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee meeting, which took place after a tumultuous exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was concerned whether she herself had to participate in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly asked why the "architect" of the Available Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program via HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you gonna be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, owner of PPF Group, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes is said to be in hand.
The transaction notice should still come in November, probably before the start of the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the group KKCG.
It was launched under the Sazka Telecommunications brand to auction frequencies for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, the company's taste to infiltrate telecommunications was not discussed.
But Sazka is now in charge of the very experienced telecom boy Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing boss of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became director of Slovak T-Mobile and last time he was head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admits she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to transfer already existing customers to its network from its own virtual operator.
I don't think Vodafone would normally like that, but according to the information of Economic Newspapers, this could be part of much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE network tender (as a rookie it can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone may not be allowed into the auction at all, or will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Saza.
Vodafone lets Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will be able to use.
Both companies can be happy.
The saved money could then be spent by Vodafone on some fixed Internet or cable television provider.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) obtained immediately a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But, on the other hand, it's a big pier that's going to expect restructuring.
At auction, Kellner would have acquired the LTE network already behind O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech Television ever be able to do without signing events?
As President Zeman’s era was entered by a legendary ashtray scene, it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that collect the documents of the castle’s den.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Třítík has not been documented in this way, let alone signed under it.
That's right, the executives stood up for the editors.
However, the cases described do not give an answer to the question as to where such attachment of some journalists is taken to the matrimonials - whether it is a direct order reaction or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathy.
And now that we assume general depravity, we cannot forgive the question of whether there are other, no less unscrupulous, powerless interests that have not yet been given the opportunity to change television conditions.
The truth is that those who say that in developed countries there is no occasional attempts to intervene politicians in broadcasting.
But the truth is also that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
Complainers do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have simply not yet reached this civilization stage and this situation is not with us.
But also in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about evil politicians and good journalists may be more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of an unclear situation in which many imperfect human beings are affected.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of strength
It is almost a rule that, at the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to fulfil its state duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential term and events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the Air Force could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight hard for its legitimacy.
And most of all, that surrender wouldn't make a nation hungover to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman, and he was still in shape during Munich, but during the war he started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he did so accordingly.
If he had been a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Ho.
He was elected with "Mr. President will not get in a position to make decisions".
But he had to, although the big decision with the knife around his neck at Hitler's chancellorship probably wasn't.
František Moravec, Director of Intelligence, told the Germans in the last few days in March 1939 what should be done so that the occupation, which he knew for a day exactly, did not run so smoothly and with such a profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, either they did not believe him, either they were afraid.
The human wreckage of Gottwald had his aged fellow comrades executed, as Moscow commanded him.
Louis Svoboda definitely made it impossible to participate in normalization and had to depose him, already senile.
That Husák was powerless and ill depressive old man's events in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only asset.
Havel was lucky he hadn't been seen in office in the last few years, he was spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, many of his actions make him aware that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces look what they look like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic right now.
Or maybe it's threatening, it's just not visible.
Then the question is, is it exceptionally not a good thing (from a historical point of view) that the President is not at his full strength.
It's not normal, though.
Couldn't we have elected a president in this country once again with an acceptable thinking and acceptable health?
Remote planets, black-and-white films, or a little fantasy of alien life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter pitches lightly.
In the conception of his quartet, which will complete this year's annual Festival of Autumn Strings on 6 November in the large hall of Prague Lucerna, everything is related to everything.
The partiture of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber matter and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, of a recent 80-year-old Shorter - extraordinary composer, nine Grammy bearer, former teammate Miles Davis and apparently the largest living jazz saxophonist today - does not like to explain.
He does not talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I found it best to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then are disappointed when things turn out differently," Shorter says.
How Insects From Thailand Raised the Sales of the Paris Bar
You may be sneering at insects without knowing that you eat about a pound a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and a unique experience you also have taken care of.
The insect offer was placed first in Paris on the menu of his business in early October by Elie Daviron, a cook and bar owner Le Festin Nu.
The bar, for whose name was the inspiration book of William Burroughs Naked Lunch, would be found in a fashionable 18th district near Montmartre by a frequented tourist.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can taste not only different larvae, locusts or water beetles, even scorpions can taste here.
Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (to prevent insects from damaging their wings, from damaging their legs or from damaging their eyes) send Davirons from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneer menu gives several reasons to consume insects.
The first is an ecological benefit because insect production is much less costly for our planet (as regards finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"Moreover, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron said for Reuters Station.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes the pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would probably be thrilled by the idea of eating a pest-decorated beetle, but the reactions of customers in the Paris bar to served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics are said to eventually taste, even though they begin with the smallest bites and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these degustation plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the state's interest in dealing with the problems of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized firms in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measure, save substantial amounts for heating, but also for construction firms and construction materials manufacturers.
Each invested billion will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of the state's fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are significant; they are also one of the most important growth measures.
The Union of Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore strongly disagrees with the Government's resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps as would allow further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be announced within its framework.

The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol Hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and left for the castle in Lány.
What kind of medical condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry indicated a softening of the U.S. defense stance on his surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented confession, he said that in some cases espionage “has gone too far.”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for treating the NSA's espionage revelations, which emerged thanks to informant Edward Snowden, as an "autopilot".
The published information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Through a video-connection to an open government conference in London, Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that were happening from inertia because there was this possibility, referring to World War II, the difficult Cold War period and then, of course, September 11."
He thus became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone too far. ”
And the President is determined to try to explain and clarify this to people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA organization strive for good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are struggling with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to killing and blowing people up and attacking governments.
What if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings from erupting, and people from being executed, because we know how to learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that US legislators are going to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged American espionage, and convinced Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participating in counter-terrorism organizations because they are disillusioned by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Indeed, it is important for the US's national-security interests that Europe should stay on board with us, in view of its joint efforts to combat terrorism, said in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, regardless of their anger over NSA programs.
News in the media that NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some American allies, although the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstood metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States,
Further disclosures cited documents revealed by Snowden that NSA was tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and other up to 34 world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the Allied's espionage as necessary and said that it was both sides' ordinary business.
In the midst of the riot Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and he hopes that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to engage are to be published.
He said the program was still under way.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the trip was to help correct relationships, he added that “well-meaning educational measures” would be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people about spy programs they have been using for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans' rights, they must also realise that we are not the only ones who are spying here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading as planned this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the hostility that has been triggered by the US strategies in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as American surveillance activities.
Australian appealed against staying in Thai prison
A 21 - year - old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-day prison on Phuket Island, falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused on June 15 by a country court on Phuket Island of perjury when she told Thai police that a taxi driver along with two other men who allegedly detained her had attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, a record from industrial television later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket Island police conducted interviews with Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention facility on the periphery in Phuket, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who requested assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"This is definitely a difficult time, but we hope they will return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia state that in the meantime, she had spent her vacation in the Krabi Recreational Region in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was reported to have received a warning that the appeal may lead to a trial that will increase her sentence and result in an adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of Australia's travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to correct a damaged picture for tourists, which may well have been behind a liberating verdict.
Jigger joked, "Breaker Goal"?
He got a puck in the defense zone, and no one caught him.
Moreover, the escape transformed after a quick forhend loop.
Jaromír Jagr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night the 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the Facebook social network.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svoboda heard from the director of the Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" he wrote in introduction with the exaggeration Jagr.
I hear we're a lot alike.
I guess I'll have to quit night training so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid the Minister of Defence might then call and make an advertisement for jets!" added emojis.
In addition, New Jersey has credited itself with a second win in a row.
"And most importantly, you have noticed - Maria Rottrov's treatment works," said Jagr.
Post-election candlehead post-election goulash
The October election rather than the winner brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that have not even made it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and ultimately the ČSSD due to its internal dissension.
Politicians served us a post-election goulash this weekend instead of a holiday candle.
Andrei Babiš, who promised voters to change the political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party record the political (from)will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who publicly supported the party, which President Zeman did not even elect to the House of Commons.
Although the President has lost his strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he has several other ways of getting it back - for example by choosing a future prime minister.
While ČSSD's chances of getting a prime seat in my eyes are moving away, businessmen Andrei Babiš are getting closer.
The post-election development is still a mile away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the electoral scenario of the left-wing ČSSD government supported by communists, this development is better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Due to the loud resistance of YES to get together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the coalition ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 Members).
Due to the division in the ČSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak parterre in negotiations, the result of coalition negotiations can be rather depressing for the ČSSD.
The Minority Government of ČSSD, composed of "non-zemananovists" at the Castle, will probably not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfactory ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further divisions in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not succeeding in more early elections?"
The next election would be rather a referendum on the strength of the ANO movement's electoral mandate.
The ČSSD's plans for introducing sector taxes, increasing income taxes more significantly or building a state bank hopefully fell below the table.
On the contrary, the parties to ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Dawn agree, for example, to promote entrepreneurship, a moderate fiscal policy (the government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The friction surfaces most occur in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
YES now has the upper hand, so the program so far most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean more to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that is still moving in the economy.
