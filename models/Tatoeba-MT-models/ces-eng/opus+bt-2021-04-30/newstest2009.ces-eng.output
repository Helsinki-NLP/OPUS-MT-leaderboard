The Prague Stock Exchange fell into a negative at the end of the trade
After the morning sharp collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
CEZ shares transactions reached almost half of the daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed its Monday slump as it declined by almost six percent right from the start of Tuesday's trade.
This time, the downturn is behind the fall in shares on Wall Street.
Here, too, the market's response to the result of the U.S. House of Representatives vote, which refused to support the plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
The fall of shares in Asia
A dramatic fall on Tuesday experienced stock on stock exchanges in Asia, although indices but over the course of the day some losses eventually erased.
The Hang Seng Exchange index in Hong Kong wrote off almost four percent during trade, but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sydney Stocks lost more than five percent, but ultimately reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to the Taiwanese index, the stock exchange dropped by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the rescue action in the US is uncertain and it will affect financial markets worldwide," noted Hong Kong monetary bureau chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy separately, i.e. without depending on China's central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly return to negotiations and propose support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it is said that other countries will also feel the effects.
American Stock Blood Bath
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected Monday's plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion was to be spent (nearly 12 trillion CZK).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest fall in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index declined by almost seven percent and recorded a drop in a similar range for the last time in 1987.
The index had fallen before the vote, but once it became clear that the motion in the House had failed, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress retreated: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
U.S. Congressional leaders and President George W. Bush's government have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
The vote will be the beginning of next week.
American legislators made a breakthrough in talks about approving the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
But the game is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the Barney Frank House told Reuters.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, there will then be a "sobriety" thanks to the complexity of mechanisms to help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have solved our differing views on the form of the package to stabilise the market," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers' representatives met US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
This should buy unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which drag financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue our recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is affecting stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are so keen to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congressional decisions could affect Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, nor whether they can be stuck to a problem at the last minute.
Lawmakers hope to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will admit a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, in a succession of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy out bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remained preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates "a two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold parachutes
Senate bank committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the negotiator's head, said the legislators agreed on responsibility for the money program, protection of taxpayers from losses, closure of reliefs, timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit so-called gold parachutes for directors of companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to supervise the fund.
That should be run by the Treasury.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful to the market and to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who have problems paying off.
The government should negotiate new repayments for mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly repayment costs for debtors and allow them to retain their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to chief economist Patrio Finance David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"This is because it is not known what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets will be bought out.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and government will divide their losses," Marek told iHned.cz this week.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, Mark says it's not that important.
"It is much more important that this week the Congressmans agree to support this plan and to sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is most important at the moment," Marek emphasized.
Knife blade fight: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise on how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
That seems to make it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner.
It's hard to get a top-notch high-end record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, such music products on LP boards do not work out and there is no objective reason in qualitative terms for this.
However, if your shelves contain vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, you may at least dream of such a gramophone.
It is the same with music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan it may be hard to chew the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines battery stamina
Some top-notch music players can do much more than just play music, but what most cell phones can't do.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
Besides primary functions, phone calls and texting, he can play music and video, record both, have a better, worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And considering smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of a cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten twelve hours, usually much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap phones, therefore, count on them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you make any more calls here and there, get one more charger to work just to be sure - that's also true of the more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem arises when you record music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but few card readers can handle miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
You do not need any special software for players except for exceptions (iPod).
All you have to do is fill the device with USB music from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players will already create a music library by the name of the performer, album name, genre or user evaluation.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to the Explorer in Windows and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones are more skilled
When selecting a specific device, be particularly interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, control comfort.
If music is primarily a set for you and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram, you just need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Which is what almost any cell phone can do.
You don't even have to watch too much of what music formats a cell phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely distributed and besides it, the vast majority of instruments can also handle music in WMA format.
AAC occurs less (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, to purchase music online.
Simply visit the respective operator's website (or other provider) via mobile internet and purchase a song or album.
This service could already in itself be a strong argument for getting a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to fast-fermented radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this method of selling music (whether through GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones around all the time.
Whenever you want to hear something, you feel the phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones are normally below three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll have a very decent walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to common headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped phones, even with a 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy to operate.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by everyone.
Minimum functions, similar control with a previously common tape recorder or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of a accidentally turned on mobile internet and subsequently a giant data transfer account.
What devices to reach for
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you can fit into 2,000 crowns.
Be careful, though.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iraver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you better reach for specialized phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokies and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
It is in the Sony Ericsson sector, whose walkman mobiles have the same user interface as individually sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to CZK 4,000, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take MP3 players away from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services such as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet there's something missing here - a virtual operator who would make the classics cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written on Mobil.cz many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
After all, CTÚ confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges regulation, this may lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrations over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to pretend that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with his own network probably no longer has a chance (after all, he would probably be hard to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant price reductions, which classical operators also had to respond to.
Prior to the entry of pikes such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in the UK as in our country.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to concentrate on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, even a bet on an innovative target group can be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Administrative guys vote Mobilking - operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could follow us.
Vodafone's press secretary Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offering."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations do not look very promising in the Czech Republic.
Mobilking will rather be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to prevent any potential competitor from developing.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator is no longer hidden by the GTS Novera Group, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid but mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have discussed this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already made progress in negotiations," says the group's press secretary Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's a better time, then.
From unofficial information it seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to maybe by the end of the year.
For now, however, its emergence is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň of the O2 Telefónika Press Department said in his comments.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press secretary Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with O2 statement: "So far, we have not recorded any viable and mutually advantageous business project on which to build further."
And he adds, "It's hard for any virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have had to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to consider this short term."
Vodafone's paying attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider most beneficial from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - one hand with operators
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a fall in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, make it easier for such a competitor to make it easier?
The fact that when operators do something, they are able to pull together is also demonstrated by the tensions around the formation of U:fona.
Probably the biggest pressure towards CTU went at the time of the formation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
But now U:phone is useful as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would lay high requirements on him and, above all, on his services."
Due to this approach of mobile operators, however, it is directly striking by the complete lack of interest of Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not just the position of CTÚ, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - has no power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stand on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator to rent the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián said in response to our inquiry to Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS External Relations Department.
It may not surprise operators’ representatives of such a formulated statement.
From an office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market, it is more than considered.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds, "In a foreign country, where virtual operators operate normally, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In fact, the shock of the entire case is the touching alignment of three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if it really is just a coincidence, is offered entirely by itself.
Like the exact same price of petrol at gas stations, it is certainly just the result of chance and hard competitive struggle.
"The Authority did not find signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they do not have adequate increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are probably missing the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
Interpretation of dominant position on the market is one of many disputed points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by CTU, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
Of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different perspective - it is always necessary to agree with the network operator to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - it has quite logically - a monopoly on its network.
So in a particular segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
Even if we do not allow this argument, it should be at least a warning for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are doing similarly.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including that of GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
The holding of responsibility at CTU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which the ÚOHS puts away from the whole matter.
We've met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent amendment to the Telecommunication Act, the extension of CTU's powers to telecommunications competition has failed to enforce, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's okay when no one's watching
The operation of some pseudovirtual operators, several of which exist in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies issuing their own mobile telephone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
Prices of these companies usually only get to the chosen ones.
The trick is that the company performs as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar sales.
"If there were any cases you are talking about, this could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would be dealing with and could result in the end of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is unlikely that similar activity would not have come to the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators shall prevent such a procedure.
In fact, these companies have significant profits and, unlike actual virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot have it fully with them as common customers of mobile operators."
But that's what the CTU should be at least weird.
In addition, another question is open for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to detect similar activities, and, if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the operators' explanation that they have no idea of such activities and their terms of trade forbid it.
When We Won't Be Most Precious
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were formed, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
Jimi's arguments used were virtually identical - too small or too saturated market, problems with quality of services etc.
In developed countries, however, regulatory authorities, which defended the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers, have intervened at these very times.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and they were packing more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators switch the whole case like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot shake the impression that the ambiguity in competence is more than useful to them in these cases.
But let's not throw a gun in the rye.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator really soon shows up, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If any of the operators admitted the emergence of a virtual mobile operator, it will hardly be possible for ÚOHS to remain indifferent to rejecting (discrimination) other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling out more than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented new recordings of the state anthem Where my home was.
The hymn was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlovka.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral submission and instrumental wording.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took the lead.
The authors of the anthem's modifications are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymens.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he deliberately chose singers with young representative voices that are distinctive and popular for singing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to be careful with both of them and then also with the congregation to have a clear indication, so that the text could be well understood, so that they could be congruent," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Estate Theatre in the original Czech play of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her for their own.
The first verse of the song then became a natural part of the state anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the formation of a separate Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem sounds like
Prague public transport will take the first time on a chip on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, it can buy roughly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) while having their chip card recorded at the information centres and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased from yesterday via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
Over 400 customers made use of the service by afternoon hours.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the delivery windows in the metro stations where they have so far had to stand regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
The coupon will be purchased via the Internet and uploaded to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these places, the passenger desk with a trained service is available to help those interested in buying online and also uploads a purchased coupon to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service automatas, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do automates look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket marks and passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltava.
"There are now five in the city, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," he added.
The coupon checks the driver's seat of the automatic
The vending machine service that starts to work tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card into it and the coupon previously paid will upload itself to it.
Electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings as of tomorrow.
Thus, on suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, by which the capital is driven mainly by the inhabitants of Central Bohemia municipalities.
"On trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, conductors are equipped with card readers, using which they detect both the time and band validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal of Ropid organization, which sets timetables for Prague public transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built in the driver's box office.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but it is also necessary to attach Opencard to the designated location on the side of the cash register.
This checks the validity of recorded coupons.
"If passengers need to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and will not remember when the coupon expires can go back to self-service slot machines where coupons are recorded on the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the display of the apparatus.
The Sudetens wanted a referendum from the U.S.
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 requested the inclusion of Sumava to the United States.
It results from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America at least.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is due, among other things, to a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is today stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the U.S. President not to allow the return of the "Sumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we want to be sure in words that American troops come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, signed by the words "People to whom the fate of Sumava lies at heart".
Since joining Czechoslovakia is said to give Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of a letter from the U.S. President to take over Šumava for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter million residents, you would admit this territory to a foreign country that oppresses and disproves minorities and nothing, has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter states.
The reason why authors cannot sign is said to be a fear of the vindictiveness of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the US allegedly doubted the thinking of the Shumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Šumava County on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of postwar history, according to some of the survivors it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that this would be about their removal from the Republic, few of them ever admitted such an option.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was like a Budejovice German deployed to the Navy in Balt during the war.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holštýnsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they got home, they would need English," Chalupa said.
None of the German captives living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, had counted on being moved out of the republic on the basis of Beneš' decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Still, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises from her to discourage the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to buckle up before they leave.
He wants to touch his conscience primarily with young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the whole campaign's "bloody" slogan says:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay" is "pay."
This is to symbolize that one can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with one's own life.
The spectators will be "terrifying" the spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic pictures of accident victims can commonly be seen.
He promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The Euro RSCG prepared the spots.
The driver’s sugar and whip
"The carrot and whip system applies to the driver.
Sugar for them is that for example, when they run a red light, they save time.
The whip is a threat to a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says hospital traffic psychologist Martin Kořán on Homolce.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in the press and especially negative ads, the psychologist means.
According to him, boards that alert the driver to danger are less effective.
"If a static board warning against danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surrounding area and drivers will not pay attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the interim Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, said to return virtually all territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Prejordan, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published on Monday by Jediot Acronot.
"We must reach an agreement with Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," said Olmert's diary.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to advance to Palestinians a similar percentage (the land of Israel), because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in a reference to two July attacks in the city, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places" that lies within the Old Town.
"He who wants to keep Israel's sovereignty above the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed further.
Leaving Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which, according to him, is an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving Golan," he pointed out.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shia movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support provided by the terrorist (the Shia movement) Hamas, (terrorist networks) Al-Qaeda and jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law doesn't know them. You can't walk on a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padova, Italy, the question arose whether stewards and passengers can move on the bus while travelling.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Apparently, the accident that killed a 22 - year - old steward last week was caused by a truck driver crossing the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus may crash or brake sharply, even when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role plays whether the bus is equipped with standing areas according to the technical license.
If there is no homologation on the bus, passengers must sit.
Long-distance buses Student Agency do not have standing spaces; this has been confirmed by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I were dealing with, and at first the movement of passengers did not allow.
Then they called it off, and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the bathroom while travelling if they have their seat," he said.
Stevard's law doesn't know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," Hanzelka says.
On the contrary, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the issue of the law is being treated sufficiently.
"It depends on whether a bus in homologation is allowed to stand.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses divide into urban where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places with higher permitted speed and long-distance without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
The BESIP transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"When driving smoothly, there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
Even here, it's not certain when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can hit her head."
"But, of course, if the bus braked sharply, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of stewards must be addressed by the carrier by internal regulations," he says, and he also means, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the service
The Agency student offers Stevard services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the Director does not consider their occupation to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that stewards are at risk, I'm gonna cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on arrival.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in security, Director Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his cars.
"We don't have stewards, we've been against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end with some fatal trauma," he said less than a year ago for Week.cz.
There's been a great tragedy.
A young steward from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident of a regular connection to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably swerved without using a rudder from the stall lane and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he hit the right front part of it.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Jančura rejects.
"These places cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked".
The firm is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ortel, but expects financial compensation from the culprit as well.
A law amendment?
Out of sight
Specification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could bring an amendment to the law, which has been worked over the year by a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"But she has not come to any concrete conclusion.
Buses don't even solve much, more of a point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be a major threat to passenger safety," concludes Hanzelka's spokesperson, adding that the safety check for buses is under the authority of the police and labour security authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The large words in the letter of the Board of Directors of WestLB to the employees of this bank are not missing.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf money institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will form "the central institution of the financial savings group for trading in capital markets," we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring in the "competence set" providing long-term revenues in this transaction.
And it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further groupings in the Landesbanks sector.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act during a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still recent.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which savings customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it is, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
At the presentation of the six-month farm results at the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas let himself hear that he did not see sense in the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with any of the Land banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, for which it stands from one half of the Landesbank and the other from the savings banks, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct interviews with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be capital-market business or part of it.
However, talks have only just begun, and financiers are concerned.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, the merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba seemed to occur.
In the end, nothing came of this troupe.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hessen Land Government opposed Helaba's participation.
Both of the other banks didn't connect that way either.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite this, speculation has repeatedly emerged about the merger of Deka-Bank with the Landesbanks.
However, recently, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, commented negatively on speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
It seems, however, that independently, it matures the belief that the convergence of various public sector banking houses is a must.
Now, after the elections to the House of Lands in Bavaria, BayernLB's association with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to begin.
That's not very good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, it gradually loses potential partners for such a connection.
In the south, she would only play a second violin despite the fact that the financial crisis still faces significantly better than bank houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In the beginning of the year, the merger with WestLB banned Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 75 % stake in Helaba.
Nord LB would be considered as such at most.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are, however, only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much they match the business models of individual institutions.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, which business model should be ensured to ensure the future competitiveness of Landesbanks, had not yet been answered by the German savings and girth banks union.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, nobody wants in this institution.
Therefore, in a letter from the board of directors there, they are also talking about trying to "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect to the connection of individual folders to Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "a weekend with the Italians"
It's the first time for Elena, for Luca, for the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so he says everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, in the five-litre barrel of Kaiser, stands a stronger beard, and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest prove how deep tones he can release his throat.
Elena will slap Luca first and then kiss him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", the expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, on one bus only Brazilians go.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
Marc, who is wearing a long coat with an imitation fur lining and glasses with wide silver frames, these three buses belong.
He's been riding with them for five years on Oktoberfest, this year alone he's been holding three tours.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, leaving back at 10:30.
Overnight would only cost unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome toast to Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian law on the cleanliness of beer, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave for the night, after the car show towards "Brennero".
Beer's not served, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers are asleep.
Good for them, they'll still need their powers.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where there are many other buses with Italian license plates on Highway 8 just outside Munich.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe as scheduled at 6:30 a.m.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's last speech explains the plan of the attack.
First, put on a yellow hat.
It says "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Two: "When the beer tent door opens, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the back of the tent.
"Not forward, that you do not interfere, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, spread around the space!"
Máz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show the janitors that we're being polite.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Three: "Be back here at exactly 10:30 tonight!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, beer tent space.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as markings on trees, signs and even on the election poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for a retreat.
As a weekend with the Italians, the second weekend of Oktoberfest is known.
Accurate figures on the number of visitors are not available; there are talks about 50,000 of those who travel through the Alps and invade beer tents, ten percent of all visitors reportedly arrived from Italy this weekend.
A series of Munich police will strengthen seven policemen from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which holds national statistics in which Italians take first place before the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments.
The tent Hofbräu is especially popular with the Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Until last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is a good thing that this politician used the word "relatively" and confused his claim with the fact that the German banking sector will not remain spared from the crisis development.
'Cause that's what happened last weekend.
By the Dax Index, the monitored financial house specialising in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan of several billion from the consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit assistance in question would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from a truly exhausted amount.
They say the money comes from private and public banks.
The losses of Depfa's subsidiary are in the background.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he lent money, this state financier was extremely short-termly refinanced, which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrank by 95% to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, income from the increased value of debts and from certain securities, as well as from the abolition of credit trading reserves, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues from the compensation for the subsequent settlement costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the interest compensation under the tax rules and for the mediation of trade for group enterprises, the 16 % decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
The former state financier was burned on mortgages for business owners after his privatisation in 1990, which were then decommissioned from the service portfolio and further led by Aareal Bank.
As there was too little money in classic state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private investor and state projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and has diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something off and these write-offs will have a "essential material effect" on the calculation of profits and losses of the whole group, as some have left themselves vaguely heard.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
It has already been cut by two-thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depfa.
Stronger than other institutes depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up, as banks guard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for part of Depfa's loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros a year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for the foreseeable period and the firm is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently largely ineligible functions".
Other sources have been heard that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets anytime soon.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
This is what shareholders and bank creditors hope.
But with regard to the dynamics and incompatibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan does not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After a late Sunday afternoon bank apparently stood before insolvency, although preliminary, rescue cannot calm the passions.
The share rate fell 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, they held the bond classes well.
While preferential debts have virtually not moved, they are losing secondary bonds courses more significantly.
This concerns mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically the bonds with maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability must be understood after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the emissions banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, payment of securities within their due date can be envisaged.
But there may also be what almost no one dares hope for at present - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, given the reports coming along with this partial nationalization, the probability bordering with certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This will likely prepare a number of sleepwalking nights for especially long-term creditors to decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the marginal line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous financial years to foreign exchange income later years for the purpose of future payment of capital revenue tax.
Sylvana and the Secret Box Bento
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop introduces herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls begin to giggle: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows that word from the mango, and on her new blog about exchange stay, she talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was scared of going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way. Fortunately, I'm not lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as harshly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine begins a short session with a teacher, called 'home room'.
But before school started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students.
Since I haven't worn my school uniform yet, I've worn the old skirt of my host mom, the blouse, the blue socks and the black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench dressed like this and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajónara Woshe Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is next week.
At that point, I was so glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawai'.
I knew that from my mangoes.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly set sail for my place.
The girl next to me smiled pretty wide, and she considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong called, they literally filled me up.
They talked over each other and giggled and asked me about both possible and impossible - and yet it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all unpacked their blinds.
My host mom also made me this lunch box - and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in a tofu batter.
I don't usually know exactly what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
The sure thing is, everything's really good.
Well, except for the salty plums, perhaps!
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a kid a custom-made bento, which is especially artistically modified in this case, hoping to get to know a boy at a snack break.
That's what I read about in my mango comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I've liked to read mangoes for years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning a little Japanese once.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I would have to come here someday.
Because I also have a thing for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach escapes danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that even many animals have feelings.
But how could it be checked that they feel the same way when they behave like we do?
For several years, the Internet magazine "Edge" has published contributions from well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in his series selected answers to the question "What do you consider true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we begin to engage in a different kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter an impassable terrain because hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, he does what many other animals do: he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal life.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include side prefrontal cortex (due to its share in short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is considerably more developed in man than in other primates, and appears to be missing from other creatures.
At least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, between them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could conceal the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if the knowledge of the language did not matter, it would certainly be influenced by the language, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That's why it's difficult to figure out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, neither can be measured nor, because of special hardware, analysed based on our own experience, it puts us in great trouble to explore it.
Most of my connections relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically more accessible.
It would be possible to examine processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick have been engaged in, focuses more on neural correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce that an emotional system, such as a fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activities.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) utilizes the operating memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely intertwined with those areas of the cortex that feature primates, and especially humans.
In conjunction with linguistic nature, there is a subtle separation of perception, because using words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and brain stem devoted to physical feelings, similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in feelings perceived by multiple animal genera.
In theory, I cannot resist this, but I find it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us in rats and humans to be fear is likely felt by both organisms as well: But how can it be verified, does Pankseep further say whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
Cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experience.
True, the neural comparison moves us on: rats and humans have brain strains similar to cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in man: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the tongue), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can look forward to progress on the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I don't examine language and consciousness, I don't explore feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than to repeatedly hurl myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: Time limit of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"Government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize ME with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But it is not amnesty for our country.
Work has only just begun and there is much to do in both countries."
In the early fulfillment of the time schedule of the construction or rebuilding of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are limping.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the chairman of the Ukrainian Union Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
Following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the leadership of the Polish PZPN Union was withdrawn and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecký.
He said there is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish press agency PAP.
"USEF president Michel Platini we assured by letter that he would not suffer the preparation for ME 2012 by this step."
Several teams from the First League were only sentenced to forced descent last season due to manipulations, eventually they had to be moved quickly to the start of the league.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Returns Strike
She wanted to advertise a new film, she talked in an interview about private matters - and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He's furious, and he's hitting back.
Late Rose War with former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors have a nasty feud - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview for the American magazine InStyle last week, first commented on the reasons for her marriage's crash: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she didn't know the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The impulse for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - he tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was marked: She is "crazy," said a 45-year-old New York Daily News actor that "Meg repeatedly chews the history of our relationship and adjusts it".
Moreover, it is "politic" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a twin father.
He concludes his consideration of cheating as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing great."
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have again decreased - this is the result of a study of the American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its data on the bookings made from the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market grew for several years, accommodation in many places has already decreased.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 monitored European cities increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most subtle was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
American Express considers a weak dollar course to be the cause of this trend, causing "the declining appetite of American tourists to travel".
The decline in hotel prices was also more heavily affected by financial centers than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices even recorded a European record with an increase of 26.3%.
Also, ticket prices showed an even higher trend in the first quarter:
Because of the cost of kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, the fuel-intensive long-distance flights even increased by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, ticket prices in the Economy class decreased by an average 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter; however, changes were less pronounced in Business and First-Class classes.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German national flights, according to the study quoted, prices even fell by half.
One reason for this price fall is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
An indication of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit lines by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods Hamburger SV gets to the head of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay no longer manages to assemble a working 11.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the failed landing for Representative Marko Marino.
This Gladbach player got involved in the game late and failed to score the ball on the stick.
His report was precisely formulated and came out of his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger shuffled in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the break between halftimes ended, and most people sat in their seats again.
Rieger has been HSV physical therapist for almost three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
Thus, his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol approached and raised his thumb as a sign of conformity.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His order probably sounded similar: here with the second goal!
It didn't happen.
"It wasn't looking at everything well today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted it more relaxed".
1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgers owe the head to Mladen Petrić (11) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbasans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of its existence this Monday.
The audience celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena, and a live updated video screen in which their team was featured as a premier.
It'll be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the continuous table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevese and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but it still cannot flash.
"We need more feeling and more drifting," Jol strongly said.
After defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by up to 700 points.
This was the greatest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow gained more weight.
Around 20.30 this most important world stock exchange barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The technological exchange of Nasdaq was with more than seven percent in negative at 1548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this point the American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' shares lost almost ten percent.
Until a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
Under the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called degraded mortgage paper.
However, the whole amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive stock options from financial companies that could be remunerated in favourable course developments, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock courses in Europe are falling steeply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not rid investors of doubt.
The share rate of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly descending and withdraws the Dax index with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange-rate losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pulled the German share index (Dax) deep into a minus.
The shares of that Munich real estate financier lost up to three quarters of its value despite the rescue action of the Federal Government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important threshold of 6000 points and with a minus of 3.7 percent scored 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York City, he began a business day on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to revive the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first hour of trading, and is thus at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives has a plan to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could comment on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges went in only one direction: in London the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index declined by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial profits.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506,43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at a value of 12,595,75.
In MDax, after the announcement of an increase in the core capital, the shares of Arcandor lost.
The private bank of Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourist group announced that it would not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, are now threatening to die of cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among scientists - an anomaly of the gravity slingshot.
The gravity sling is an aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in a gravitational field of some space body, such as Earth.
The probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case in wonder: flying bodies do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, irregularities occur at speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by an anomaly of the gravity sling.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curving space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravity slingshot using so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The answer for this anomaly could be a dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space explorers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously based on a gravitational force whose effect on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
It itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to a statement from the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, kidnapped tourists are again at large.
The Sudanese hijackers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were said to have been killed in a pre-release shootout.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
I hear the ransom hearing's on.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists dragged into the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by the same Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabía, and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed according to reports from Italian television station Sky TG 24 release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were liberated.
We are checking their health," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shootout before the hostage was released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the said worker.
He said "it was just about taking the hostages," when suddenly this surprise came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six hijackers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a €6 million ransom from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The "El Masri El Jom" diary, with reference to one of the German intermediaries, stated that the release of hostages was prolonging because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men should be kept until the kidnappers have a secure escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Several years of stepfather abuse led a woman to kill herself, heard in court.
After confessing to eight sexual harassment cases, 75-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in a confession.
In court, it was also said that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
While living in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her eyes and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, in court, it was said that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time volunteering for the National Trust organization, was persecuted by the specter of abuse committed on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife stated in court that in 2006 they told Ms. Randle's friends, who also devoted herself very much to surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to suffocate with a plastic bag.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words, "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, the matter probably wouldn't have come to trial at all."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Obviously otherwise, she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man concerned left two top-secret documents on the Waterloo train at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the aforementioned law, and nothing suggests criminal intent.
BBC Secretary for Defense Affairs Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was handled internally between the Ministry and the Government Office," he said.
An employee who may not be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended to the Metropolitan Police an official to indict on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al-Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Cooperative credit unions face B&B debt
British cooperative credit unions may have to settle over £80 million after saving Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government provided £2.6 million of clients in Bradford & Bingley with £14 billion to protect deposits.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative banks.
The CEO of the Association of Cooperative Creditors (BSA) Adrian Coles said he was "humiliating", that the creditors and their members must pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by bailing out Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that is being accumulated in the meantime will be paid each year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The compensation plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperative banks are counted in this issue.
It's humbling that these institutions that have been prudent... now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that have been far from that prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each firm should pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the credit cards should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the credit cards will have to find £81 million to pay off the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Co-operative Credits Trade Association, told the BBC that he was convinced that it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the expansion of the housing market now have to pay off some accounts of those institutions that were far from that prudent."
According to the BSA, no credit card has fallen since 1945 when it appeared.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what the options are to protect the credit unions and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year, and this could be almost twice as much.
As cooperative credit unions are share organizations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk will cost fivepence per litre
People in Jersey might have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy has announced that as of Monday, it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by fivepence per litre.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence auction in February, and comes after research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the cost in customer prices.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladesh Expremier Denied
Bangladeshi court denied former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid's request for bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegations that she received over fifty million taka (729,700 dollars) from a particular businessman when she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption being brought against it.
Chálida Zija, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasína is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), asked for the local army held by the government first to give her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was released on her word of honor to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is unclear under the conditions of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court denied Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, stating that he does not need bail when he is already receiving examinations released abroad for an affidavit," said her defense attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against High Court orders."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December election.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasina is to return home after 17 October.
She was detained last year after the army held by the interim government took over power, but was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for a medical procedure.
Sheikh Hasinah and Khalida Zijá both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in recent polio vaccination due to Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the UN carried out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, it says that for security reasons it could not reach the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
A UN spokesman stated that this happened despite Taliban promises that he would not attack or defend thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB lost the ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost the litigation over the review of the Commission’s competition decision, which ordered the company to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB’s appeal court ordered it to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission previously stated that the share of BSkyB undermined competition and gave companies disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased the share in 2006 in a business that, as a result, prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV to purchase.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB gave rise to doubts about the independence of ITV, and called on the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The head of the consortium Virgin Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to purchase.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its participation in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution to the disproportional - primarily because the BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to waive its voting rights.
New investigations into the American attorneys affair
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report on the affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislator, and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "A serious accusation, including potential criminal acts, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of their office in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry stated that lawyers were released due to poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissed lawyers were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the attorneys were involved in prosecution of senior Republican MPs and senators, others refused to investigate the allegations of electorate deception brought against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and conduct lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire because of the dismissals and eventually resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report expressed a very critical view of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying that he had "main responsibility" for layoffs that he "abdicated" from his leading position and did not "remarkably engage" in the action.
Other officials, including former senior Bush advisor Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for its epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who comes to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" by the acclaim earned.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The nomination for this year is led by the Coldplay group, which made it to the narrower selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached a maximum of fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell held in the rankings for about nine years and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Day - has suffered from health problems in recent years, was also operated due to irregular heart rhythms after he collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out he had cysts on his vocal cords.
Obscurary streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many Veterans taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village district and runs north of First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty metres, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic move.
There are no street signs.
It's practically invisible in a common atlas.
Still, he has an admirer's aisle.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to newly pave Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were charmed by a short alley simply because it was one of the last remains from before the block was refined.
However, the city’s Office for the Protection and Development of Construction, which has the street in its power, has no interest in holding it.
At the meeting of the Municipal Community Land Committee, representatives of the Municipal Authority and Avalon Bay drew up a plan that the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzanne Stetzer, District Manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favors such a variant where the street remains in the city's hands, and asked for a new plan to be made next month.
"The city no longer owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"Repair and administration proposals could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to newly pave the small street and set up seating places, several of which would be used by a cafe, whose interest in renting the property the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to fix this derelict alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Office for the Conservation of Buildings, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the task of his office was to develop property rather than to manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children and on that narrow strip of land no one claimed.
The back door of CBGB, a punkrock monument, was led to Extra Place, closed in 2006, and the aisle is perhaps best known as the background photo on the Ramones album cover "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the processing of the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, albeit meager, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (under the heading "The Book of Moanings: A bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of dying out"), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the section Let's talk about the city that appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote, "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even by day and bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and locked windows, where week-old newspapers run through the gully."
Except for a few exceptions, the alleyway of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat ran across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where the expensive clothing store stands today.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers there was an empty beer bottle.
A couple of passers-bys said he rarely thinks of Extra Place, but suggested that he could use a boost.
Fields, on the other hand, said that he thought that some people underestimated the impact of the alley in its current state.
"Best years of my life," he said, "they were in places dark, wet, and disgusting."
Bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this edition of the section Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the attitude of candidates towards bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and Director of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools".
To address Hispanic voters effectively is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda proves it.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda particularly promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are still learning English.
The question with Barack Obama remains, however, whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East.
The pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom arrived only recently, are still learning English.
Despite this, in the state mathematics tests in 2008, the highest level of incredible 100 percent of fourth-class pupils was reached.
Almost the same amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-class pupils have reached the highest level in state tests from English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Further, and Obama should note this, according to Linda Mikelsová, the principal of Sixth Street, the educational approach of the school for those who are learning English, is "complete immersion".
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me, "We have had great success with one brand-new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter the class and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take school as Sixth Street Prep as a role model, what should other schools with large portions of Hispanic and English learning students look like?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question obvious, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education makes the prediction of Obama’s answer unclear.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he stated that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to delete the performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than mocking them and trivializing them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the US plan to save the financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell by as much as $7% to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York commodity exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and also by a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen earlier this month to almost $90 per barrel, and then jumped again on a wave of huge financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety re-engaged investors on Monday, even after the Bureau of Congress announced that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history this weekend.
This report was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of advancing degradation, the government announced that the Citigroup group would purchase a bank section of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch, and Luxembourg Governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that the furious weekend negotiations that led to a plan to save the economy "returned as unable to revive the mood in the market".
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates, and exchange rates have become heavily unsettled," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From the commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread throughout the world and especially to China."
Analysts of this bank limited their expectations for the next year, as oil consumption declined due to slower economic growth, and reduced their forecast of gasoline prices to 2009 by about 20%.
Wild riding in the second quarter broke the team record
After spending the Jets in his jersey for the last eight seasons more than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a spandex ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals leveled their troubled game with gloomy clouds above each other.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, thus perfectly predicting the afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved miles forward.
Favre dispatched Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half game.
"It was nothing special," Favre told Coles about all his passes.
"He's a damn good player.
We had excellent communication, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were throwing, defense attacked Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis intercepted a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards to a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, may have been the best ever.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely's twenty-yard goal out of the field, earning a lead of 34–0.
That's the most the Jets ever got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
Many points fell in a short period of time."
Rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him to be the best long-distance runner ever when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon he broke his own world record and became the first person to run a 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning the pleasantly flat track in time 2:03:59, he rolled over by 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - broke the world record or is at least world champion at all distances from metric mile to marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassia missed the Beijing Olympic marathon because he was afraid - perhaps too scared in retrospect - that the polluted air upsets his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - he won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a flashy average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on longer lines, the marathon record in the past decade has fallen by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassia told journalists that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the break got him excited rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I was a little bit in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - because he said he over-planned his races, generally avoided world marathon peaks, relied on conductors, as if it were a race on a track, and built world records over the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running qualities.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassia half in time 1:02:04.
After the wires dropped, two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi were constantly chasing Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal Gebreselassie last worked and escaped Kwambai, who then ran in second place at 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in time 2:07:48.
In the women's race, an excellent year finished with the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
Record time 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won last spring in the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games missed because of something that was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon, which had ever run, improved its personal maximum by nearly five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big lead and then reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in time 2:25:01.
Pride and Obstacles of the Life of Blacks in a Separate City
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy, and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and intensity of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black town to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three croquet courses, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough guava, two schools, and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville festival Zora! to pay homage to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, although she made it a stop for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression.
He is still as independent, dignified and private as he was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for open debate on races, many local residents remain cautious of foreign views.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and a community of nearly 2400 people, where poverty rates are twice as high as the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but also oaks shaded by an example of Southern rural Negro culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that originated from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the worry about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way to say Hurston here.
She presented her hometown to the world through hearty books full of dialects such as "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes watched God)" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the town a bit into Route 17, which runs through the often ephemeral center of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With the shock of a great drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into an hour-long hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville connected with self-government, but also with illiteracy, re-marriage, and sex.
Obviously, this wasn't a typical Fodor's publishing house.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls' choirs, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventy - seven - year - old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time, when she stormed into town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevy, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is proud of dignified clothing.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many laughed.
"The people of Zoru have always been happy to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "it never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to forget her and the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its significance for the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography "Wrapped in Rainbows (Packed in Rainbows)" published in 2003.
Change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a local two-lane main road.
The discovery of Orlando has already pushed Interstate Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a complicated historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to stir races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw melon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and for his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber stated that he was "offensive to my race rather than celebrating."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of local youth.
"Black children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save Eatonville Community).
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You don't hug your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
However, civil rights helped create room for many other Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can one deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the shelves in bookstores praised by Robert E. Hemenway's biography of Hurston, who reclassified her to the American Canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter found the ramp's lights again.
Former Hurston neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what can happen to its highway destroy, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After a few years, the state retreated from the highway design.
"The five currents of the highway revived, you would say that it directly detonated, real civic pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the highway project helped change the city's image.
Extra-urban like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began going to the local church in 1993, began to appear in more numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historic Register in 1998.
The new single-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 at the re-favoured and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a dark alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to seek the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated cautiously.
Permission for most interviews must be given in advance and certain things - like murals in the oldest Eatonville church painted by white people and depicting black people in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival increased, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, and equally proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, sincere love for the community sounds when she plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or a police force she says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as eleven - year - old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, think, 'Hmm, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice town."
We're all fluent in finance here in New York.
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper stands and huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glass bee hive offices above their heads, every day bankers and hedge fund managers monopolizing New York have had the worst "bad day in office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers still rumble with metal carts on the sidewalks and carry muffins to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move among the towerers and wear, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts that hang from weights on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel by the street dining stands, and it is still not possible to get a yellow cab on weekday between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon with all the pessimism talk.
Even though I timed this assignment to cover with a late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of the cash windows to collect or store cash, but in front of the counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's mixed goods store and new customers start accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already raised their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They have collected money from so-called Thrifts (a little bit like construction savings banks), money associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks went silently bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion asset bank, went into bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion asset, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Office and store employees standing in front of me and afraid of another collapse, moving their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe port and which does most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent finance over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the failed bank, and to her skinny chief executive Dick Fuld with such a familiarity as gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed roughly 50-year-old landlord of my tenement, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation-- Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated after the Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-wing side of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing side of Vlaams Belang participates in the rally that presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to the organization "City against Islamisation".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that depict mosques crossed by red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extremely right-wing parties achieved huge profits in the general election.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were badly damaged sometime between Friday night and this morning, and police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as David's star, but detectives believe that this may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident has been linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic community here said that they are "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming at the end of the Muslim Lent Month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria enters the round of searching for its own soul after the right swings in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both far-right parties, which won more than 30 percent of the vote together, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Free Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against scarves and burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods in which a relation to Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of the "European Brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides try to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't take a trip abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has forbidden the court to travel to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police were agreed to this travel ban last Thursday after passing evidence on Glitter's previous child sexual abuse convictions to officials.
Glitter, in his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal trial in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kent Police requested a regulation that would prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as it stores him with a sex offender record.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also hand the scheduled date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If the duty to inform the authorities had failed, he could have been sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kentian police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent residents is a top priority for the Kent police and we are working hard to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual attackers in order to minimize any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to embark on a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London while simultaneously requesting an order that imposed on him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the Home Office said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I take pictures of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of great flamenco masters, unbound from focusing on interpretation - I will only achieve the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other hand, human.
Inseparable, aside from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - it is then possible to see a confidential gesture, depth of a glimpsed glimpse or passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to appear on the stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" theatricality performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known face of masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from various backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the Moon Photography Flamenco program (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international significance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any kind of people, but when you look at photographs, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portraited "on the street" are artists capable of transferring passion, sadness, joy... and completely captivating the viewers.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamencos.
Charmed by the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began a long way in 1997 to portrait flamenco singers, guitarists, and panel camera dancers.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means contradicts the classical basis of the picture and lends it the present spirit, an idea that Bauer himself thinks is mirrored by flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which does not cease to surprise and evolve."
What tears down viewers is not the action of dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is the constant work presented during these days at the El Fotómata Gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographers is made by famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project became a kind of flamenco anthology and will soon see a book release that will contain exhibited portraits.
Passion for portraiting led Bauer to the idea two years ago to repeat the idea on "Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think in photography, a portrait is the most difficult genre.
One meets or encounters people, personalities that sometimes do not even know, or only give one a few minutes to shoot.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "troubled"
It takes place in an environment that he does not yet know, and tells of events for him unknowns, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for twenty years and traveled in the Amazon.
Last night at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival, he admitted that the project currently employing him "is presumptuous", and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't have done it, but I will, and I believe I will one day finish it," concluded his contribution at the Festival of Exchange of Ideas, Thoughts and Words, which he saw in the town of aqueduct around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year festival of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the Most Popular Writer - an old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had before him a dedicated audience, whose hour of time passed like water - Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a great deal of humor recalled in him how from the original "unbelievable adventure" of "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than what I lived" he gave birth to a literary mission; as he supplicates the "lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", carefully stacks the lyrics, correcting and rewriting; or how they influenced his writing by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "memory images" are the basis of his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to determine whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, fleeting experience" - stressed Vargas Llosa, saying that he "affects people" and "forces them to try to get out of line", and urged the writer to "subside to frivolity" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of climatology, he loses the festival in Pozoblanc - missing lance
The performance with the spears closing the festival in Pozoblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement by the performers that the square's surface was not in good condition was confirmed.
Therefore, the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions plague this festival in the long run, no longer two of the three celebrations could take place.
On Saturday, rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfights.
During them, formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz, and Juan Bautista were to face bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
But that was only Friday night.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance was carried out on his shoulders.
On the same day of the afternoon Alejandro Talavante exchanged two javelin wounds for greetings and one ear, which was brought to him by the exposed seats in the arena rather than the Toreadorian art.
Even worse was El Juli, who took a walk through the Los Llanos bull ring unhappiness.
In the second round of hard work without a single breath, he earned a sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They ran off to check in the Alava in a van with 2,000 pounds of hash
Ten minutes to five.
Road Control Ertzaintza in the municipal district of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop two people driving in the van and they're missing them.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report from the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, the members pursued them and detained one of the persons riding in the van, a man aged 38 who was identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was accused of smuggling drugs and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out roadside checks on N-1 in places where it crosses the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply and ran away.
The car was immediately prosecuted until the vehicle stopped at the edge a few miles away, at which point both passengers jumped out and set off to escape into the forest.
Ertzaintz's officers eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,187 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects carried, as revealed in the search of the Iveco Daily brand.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
Moreover, the police found that the license plate was "smeared" and did not agree with the particulars given in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to flee in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee A. A. J., 28, was transferred to the police department to deal with the appropriate formalities before they later proceed to further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda's favorite from the Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers while trying to drive out of a Montecito parking lot, she reported to People the spokesman for California road patrols.
The witness specified that at around 4.30 p.m. Locklear "stuck on the gas, drove forward and backward during the noisy roaring and tried to drive out of the parking space - she ran over her sunglasses several times while backing back".
A witness who apparently did not first recognize the actress saw Locklear moments after stopping on the nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because she "was afraid for the life of Locklear".
When the police patrol arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented", and therefore members took her to a specialised drug and alcohol center to submit to the test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and the excess amount of alcohol was immediately excluded, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was evident to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of a more unspecified substance, and was taken into custody around 19.00, although she had been released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Association of IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The IU chief general and MP behind the United Left Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Youth Councilman's Department and Sports Town Hall in Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of acting for the benefit of his family, would depend on the party's county association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares indicated a meeting to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that, in the case of an investigation into the illegal acts committed by Silva, "transparency" was absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
Likewise, he stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), the epic bet by Garcia
José Luis Garci in the film "May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by Episodes from Benito Pérez Galdós' national past, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the film creator wanted to "draw eloquence of characters and analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the picture in front of an extensive team of performers.
May blood with a frosting over two and a half hours will be inducted into the cinemas this Friday and in the future there will be more than a four-hour series for Telemadrid television.
As a great admirer of the literary creation of Galdós José Luis Garci claims that by making this film he fulfilled the "child's dream", due to Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to shoot a photo for the 200th anniversary of Madrid's 2nd May, he accepted the offer with the story based on the Episode of the National Past.
The $15 million budget, to which the province of Madrid has completely contributed, means for Garcia a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with sets and costumes matching the image of a "fragile Spain that was wrong in the leader for which it was possible to fight - the fight for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country during Ferdinand VII's reign," he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support given to the films Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goy's Spectres - almost twice as much May blood - so he could not make some scenes from a screenplay signed at the same time by Horaci Valcarcel, which he works with almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and empezar) works as he is commonly used to - on the scene along with actors he usually tries with before filming and does not choose casting because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas among other things and so to learn what is happening in the craft he is engaged in".
Many actors selected for May's blood appear in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci with four Oscar nominations, one of whom he won, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiard and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represents a young generation of Spanish film scene, but claims that "it will yet appear".
There is no award for this film, Garcia.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're only working for profit, so you're willing to make one more movie," Garcia explains with more than 30 years of directorial career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Sevilla's dancer Tortola Valencia
Sevilla flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevilla dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, from the father of the Catalan (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusan (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dances and focused on Oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
This woman's life, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, enchanted Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "dance butterfly" evoked me a guajira or "dance snake" a thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also corresponds," she claims.
The performance counts with the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Lead, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and with dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she has accepted an offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honour for me."
In the performance also counts with the music and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadonians with all things, and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place at such far places as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was of those women who have a huge influence at some time, but today nobody knows her and even less appreciates her work," Bayón says.
The show begins today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Newly Married Diary" closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "New Married Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Triennale of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
"The Triennale of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with the new release of this work, an international congress to be held in New York City, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sun Beam" opened in May of this year, and after going around various Andalusian provinces, it should, according to plans, move to New York at the time of the congress.
The cultural council of the autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Diary" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of the most holy Andalusian poets.
America doesn't like each other so much without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Intention" and under the burden of knowing that Newman had left, revealing her dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be severely ill.
Even so, he was a man to all of us.
"Sometimes what a man feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of the film and the country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at its bottom when desperate reasons for pride are being sought.
When times are rough and people without virtue and only a handful of those worth your admiration - there is no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from a drug addiction foundation based on honor of the firstborn son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-cooked food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that took much effort to free itself from a suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that one man did not die, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar holder for directing Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman has been living today - he takes pride in honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, that's what people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and has since been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
May his pride in heaven guide him that there is a harmony between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was proudest of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a self-sacrifice philanthropist".
Imperfect Races of Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and perhaps 2016 after the failed year.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say no!
It was spoken of as a perfect race, and in my judgment, he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense that if it were an evaluation and I was an examiner, it would clearly be inadequate.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one at a time.
Nonsense begins with picking up the race number, which makes you have to leave early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip to avoid overfilling the track).
Oh, no.
Here one had to first pick up a number (first nonsense, go there only because of that) and (after standing the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a S-sized T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need the size XL).
Where do we live?
Have they decided to buy only small T-shirts due to the crisis because it's less fabric and they're cheaper?
Well, those are little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very early for the chip and the queue lasted over 15 minutes for it, he still had to hand in the backpack.
Over 35 minutes the waiting time lasted, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put our backpacks down yet, and when we did, the pickup was much worse.
In addition, the waiting extended the rain by 40 minutes, leading to general rebellion and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not show the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, did not record my launch time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, I wouldn't think of this one.
So I guess we're just gonna have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft showed further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system on the artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as summoning a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move across the company's premises) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort the present by conversation groups.
On the receptionist's demonstration video, she records a third person and understands that she does not belong to the group talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going to see anyone, and she's telling her that she'll be with her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Fascinating.
But that's the music of the future, of course.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the necessary, without the burden of commercial waste, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discovery as thunder, considering that Microsoft version since version adds new features to Windows and other "extra".
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who tended to the theory that it was Google's first step towards competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is necessary to communicate between hardware and software.
She has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and more to the Internet browser.
The computer is turned on to trigger Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What is the purpose of half the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a little example.
I took this photo in a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drink machine that begged them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed to be delayed.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's just count on 2010.
In Microsoft, they will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azure Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one glow in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppoly's "Godfather", and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to make a list of his life roles, we can immerse ourselves in the image of a typical muscular man with a pointed mustache that lifts weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton men's undershirt, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels excels above all others.
First of all for his carnal name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' excels over other high quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost noticeable) Belgian flag, which are the models of the most emblematic tank tops as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not only specialize in tank tops.
He also manufactures sweatshirts collegee, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy shirts, children's suits, mini shorts...
Premeditated pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's too bad they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
A tremendous resemblance to her sister did not stop her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though small figures, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are taking their new acting in fashion very seriously now.
It means a lot more to Mónica than some pretty, famous girl giving her name.
In Paris, Mango participated in a promotion held at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most significant fashion prizes sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's heartless and shy, and she's going to win you over.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango this year's autumn-winter season, while also attending the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
So it was a challenging but exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love the '50s and '60s movies, and we've drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also like to wander around town and watch women wear clothes, combine and hang their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
Maybe I liked her clothes when I was a kid. I still wanted to go to my grandmother's house, wake up in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the fair.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to look out for my clothes.
You know, we dancers pride ourselves on how we're groomed to feel good about our hours and rehearsals looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really penetrate the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 recently, did you have a crisis?
Nope.
I feel better than I've ever felt in my 30s.
I find that the woman is finished, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological lessons don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So are you thinking of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father is concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness, and I will raise him with great love.
As for the film, you're about to have a few premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing them at the movies.
I come from a theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course I can't.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like them...
You had your premiere a few days ago at the show pier alongside Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm going up to the pier like a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes we've been performing - I've selected two models from our collection for Mango - and the proceeds have been handed over to this Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are said about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity purposes, but if she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it, too.
For the benefit of the Third World women, I will do what is necessary.
Drivers caught repeatedly with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Interior Ministry requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol have to install a system in his vehicle to prevent him from starting his car drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was already known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General, according to which it is a pilot project that lasts one year.
Its aim is to get the driver behind the wheel, which is why drivers will also have to take a course in transport reeducation.
In addition to the National Authority for Transport Safety, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA) Foundation will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of car drivers charged more than once for drunk driving will again get behind the wheel in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if the alcohol concentration is higher than the permitted concentration.
Its price exceeds EUR 1,000 and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study conducted in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that in respect of vehicles equipped with this equipment, the offences decreased by 65% during the first year since the introduction.
In Spain, 115 people are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help implement it, as legislation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary regulation of criminal provisions, however, requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been installed in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE proposal (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17.40 p.m., as it stood in the program, a Spanish air force plane landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in México D. F., in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was just setting, but so far its rays forced their eyes to close their hands so that a follower couple could be seen coming out of the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials stood under the steps.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were arriving for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, that's not gonna get to the airport to recruit people... she's from here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just outside the red carpet and military cordon, which makes up 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorable volley.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, very moderately dressed and with her hair out, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that there is a storm in D. F.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation awaits, they smile at the photographers and pose freely.
At the hotel's door, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, is waiting for them by a talkative Mexican television reporter.
Best subsidized fashion price
Perhaps there is no more suitable place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there is probably no more outstanding designer and blabbing than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation to new talent in the field of fashion.
The price is subsidized by EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the first-year winner, looked at her designs in the Manga window on Paris Boulevard 54 and almost cried by commuting.
Of course, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest one is located in London.
Many events along with the desire to thank designer Valentino for taking the chair of the competition jury caused us to finally dine in Paris' Garnier Opera.
The firmu Mango's festively decorated chair table looked a little more amazing next to Chagall's finest works.
Nati, with a heart-broken grief for her brother's recent death, had put on the dress of this brand and the jewelry of ELAH, over which breath was hidden, and hung into her son Luis - a nearly two-metre elegane - escorted Valentino at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, as a true gentleman, remained with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, for they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - hand-designed - pants and shirt and changed into long black sexy dresses for dinner, moved a night walk around the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the hall for ballet rehearsals, and in memory of other times she grabbed one of the bars and indicated "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stay for a tour of the palace buildings, but before leaving, she showed us pictures of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance not to use any scents in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Parisian sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget about messy and furious everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book, which on September 30 will bring relaxation to the bookstore.
The alarm rings at 7 a.m. every morning as punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself consumed in the hasty rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called suspense and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods of combating daily exhaustion and the problems of getting away from the world of work.
No, the number is no larger and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside Yogi positions, classic massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book has collected an entire "men" option, adapted to each individual's taste and time options.
The stress book is called "1001 method of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK's publishing house will bring peace to the bookstore.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies that view.
In addition, it offers further procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If there is no adrenaline in your veins that restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they're sleeping.
The first time this happens, it might scare you, but it's actually meaningless.
It is a harmless sleep disorder called the somnolnoquia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure you've told more than one of you that he spoke in his sleep last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadicly (for example once a lifetime in high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There's only one reason to explain her coming in.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nocturna (night wetting) or sleepwalking, but it may not be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stress or distraught situations.
In any case, this is a little underexplored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or quite the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where he manifests himself with great strength, it would be advisable to observe and consult an expert to see if he has any problems that cause him great anxiety and this is how he manifests himself.
We said it was a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do that by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent television programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who can work to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When the somnolyquies appear, try to remain calm.
Recall that she is harmless to the child and that she will remember nothing of what happened the next day.
Useful Advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're gonna interrupt his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and he rests.
Remember, if several times in a row you feel that they are very troubled, it would be advisable to seek advice or to find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If it is understood what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and extract information from him.
It won't do any good, because when she's asleep, she's not conscious enough to get her thoughts straight.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of, and therefore why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret information and what conclusions you are reaching.
Never tell a kid you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even funny.
This causes great anxiety.
Just don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory after a long thin period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks have created more chances and managed to turn one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were difficult to assert themselves.
After the captain's first attempt, he hosts Kauffmann, who by a shot from a distance just by a hair missed the link, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defenses of Dannemaria.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field and left only agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which he took care of Marais, well situated for the processing of the ball reflected after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
However, Golman Illhaeusernu did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his teammates in weakness.
However, Dannemaria could not benefit from it and the eleven of Illhaeusern, who only withdrew a little to "concentrate" the defense, no more causing any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew through very close to the bridge after the great confusion.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
To face a demonstration of the power of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to set out on Tuesday morning at Guilvinec Port in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to be adopted 'in a constructive spirit', hoping to 'come up with concrete proposals'.
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the 'crisis committee' created by Breton fishermen in order to take action against a sharp increase in oil prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elysian Palace spokesman David Martinon, the President will "talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure employment and payout of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with tenacity.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation "snake" (an operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km traffic jam.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter dam was opened on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Sailors demonstrated their determination as early as Monday, with demonstrations taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc in front of the ports' fuel depots in Brest and Lorient.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the canal of la Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and from Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped during the evening a blockade of the important Total Refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they eventually decided to act, until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is to decide on how to continue the road, and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the State Department of Fisheries, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not drop anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Department, for example.
Professional fishermen who do not pay oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but they consider that the ship's profitability threshold is only achieved when the oil is below EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman spectacular
An unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died in the aftermath of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or also Sam Mendes bowed to the film's legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer retains its supply conditions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies this year on a supply of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of a recession hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aviation constructor in the world, Embraer, retains his supply conditions for 2008 with 215 supplied devices, confirmed by his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half, the manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a great deal from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer supplied the Chinese clients with 41 devices within eight years.
AIG is supposedly considering a transfer of 15% of its assets
An American International Group insurer, whom U.S. money authorities have put over water, is considering advancing more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion he was given as a down payment, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to explore the sale of most of its activities outside life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying a diary that cites sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to France Télécom, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday during the evening to examine the eventual referral.
Any confirmatory statement could not be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp. Air Lease leasing branch, its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance provider, as well as its real estate portfolio and investment in private equity, are supplied by France Télécom.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, France Télécom continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash in order to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank at the risk of US authorities confiscating 80% of its capital, thus diluting it into a proper ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historical sitting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The largest point drop in its history (by 684.81 points) recorded on September 17, 2001, on the day of the resumption of trading following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to definitive data after the trading deadline, 199.61 points and settled to 1,983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Depressed since the beginning of the session, Wall Street has literally collapsed following an unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan by the House of Representatives, a plan that was intended to allow a little stability to be re-established in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Almost two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent out to the market that sees Congress unable to accept a certain plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days' time would not come 'too late'.
"If this project is indeed doomed (...), the relay will be handed over immediately to the Fed (American Central Bank, red.) and to other central banks to prevent the crisis, which would more consolidate the loan conditions," warned Brian Bethune, Global Insight's leading economist.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After Friday's collapse, Washington Mutual's authorities organized the buyout of bank Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took a turn and demanded urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are not facing "just the US crisis, but the world crisis", added an analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen strongly.
Cashout income to 10 years fell to 3.632% compared to 3.827% on Friday night, yield to 30 years to 4.161% compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama won on points in the first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, the debate was followed by the second, whose task was to find out which of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The command tents of the Republicans and Democrats campaign did not surprise when they both declared their victory in a television duel that watched a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent he was, was not "brillant enough" to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of the polled, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% attribute victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday by means of a presumed good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She is gifted," Bill Clinton pointed out on the weekend.
Seventy-seven McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on issues that formed the core of the first clash.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was a repeated charge.
"I don't think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
Republican television spots have been carried in such an offensive spirit since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and turned out to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does," replied a democratic spot on the weekend, accusing Republicans of failing to take sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on a "common American".
"During the 90-minute debate of this John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina during a severe rainfall.
Nor did he utter words such as "middle class" or "working class". Financial decay clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"Next week could take a decisive turn," estimated influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight-year bad economic policy, as operated by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
The Illinois Senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes to 95% of Americans, also pointing out that the realisation of a country's eventual energy independence through promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided issues regarding the $700 billion financial aid plan (€470 billion), which was adopted last night by Congress and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the parliamentary elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closure of the electoral rooms on the main square in Minsk to protest the illegality of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenka's regime: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they did not even go to the election: "What good would it be if they did what they wanted with my voice anyway," says a young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, that was not the case.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote census," Juri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, complained about a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexandr Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who tallies the votes, and in our country it is executive power.
If any opposition Members get into parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform, we are threatened to become protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the election process, should not declare the election valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there were any elections?" asks social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in Parliament, those most fit for the regime."
The night's silence once again took hold of the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on success.
Interview - Blood That Is Again Certain
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the foundation yesterday, and his president, Dr Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced, as Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve administered by the Canada Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and wave of public displeasure, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Kráter, which aimed to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy, and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated again.
While Judge Kráter was stalling to submit a report, some provinces set in motion a committee whose aim was to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was played by the Gélinea Committee.
After Gélineau and Kráter's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, who was to be managed by Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec launched its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system," recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
With a consistent effort to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the years, we have regained public confidence," Hema-Québek said, proudly adding that by early 2008 almost 94% of the Québek population had trusted.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
"Then we have seen many cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has been leading the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of Kráter and Gélineau's report, according to which, if we do not know this and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusionary measures must be taken.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, it was then safely proven that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the principle of prudence."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for HIV virus detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests that allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in donor blood rather than the presence of antibodies based on tests previously used.
NAT tests have allowed the deaf period to be shortened between the moment the patient is infected and the moment our techniques in the blood can be exposed by the first viruses, the specialist explains.
We managed to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have substantially reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing and without finding out.
These improvements allowed the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions to be significantly reduced.
Today, one person in 12 million is exposed to the risk of receiving HIV - contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission via a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary to heal," says Hema-Québek's head of management.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of disease element can appear in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by insect stings.
We need to be constantly cautious," Dr. Décary continues, stressing that aside from safe supply, Hema-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment for cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Québečany permitted to donate."
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, meaning six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not on average accepted because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud fevers are rampant, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Weaknesses are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
But convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary writes.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québek, who also manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord previously considered biomedical waste has blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th sample of blood from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we expect to collect over a thousand a year.
In the early next year, we should start offering them for transplants," Dr. Décary explains, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," as Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final elimination series of the first division of USL yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and crucial match of the quarter-final played on the total number of goals, thanks to a win of 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders of Seattle.
Backer Antonio Ribeiro gave a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a double-sided goalless first half, reserve David Testo and Rocco Plancentino were joined by the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to deal with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Let us recall that on Friday during the first of the two quarterfinals, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex in Tukwila in the suburb of Seattle.
Impact measures in the semifinals of its strength with Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder leveled the 3-1 deficit in the home match and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps advanced to the semi-final round with a total score of 5:4.
Impact should clash with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, however, details of a series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovaleva's winning goal
The first attack trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekance and Andrei Kosticin last night at Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists and Kovalev reaped one pass in this fourth win of three-colored out of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need one more game to make me feel good."
"In the first period he tried to handle too much," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice round of applause."
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party Assembly (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Québek, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's complementing elections.
"Put aside the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the conclusion of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Levis, but did not disclose the details.
During his speech, pictures were shown behind his back in a kind of picture grinder.
On three giant canvases, a loop ran with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, like in the pre-election period.
After all, at a press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that it would trigger early elections in the autumn, although he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
"Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes a labour agreement with France, a treaty between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - Northern Territory to the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents "a curse with huge potential", but it did not state the term, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forests, but mainly the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice the size of France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it's not just with us, but it's in us," he emphasized, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, highlighted by the Prime Minister: a gold hunt in Abitibi, Québek engineering, James's Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he theatrically paused to see a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of the Québek territory, includes a portion of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, specified the Prime Minister during a press conference.
"This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all the governments to date.
There is one border line that no longer exists for a long time, and if an appropriate opportunity arises, I will retake this position in the name of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "there is also a need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change", he stated when talking about the North-West transition, which will open year-round due to the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking the territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territories, the indigenous nations, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Québek government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially young ones.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large meeting, 'not necessarily a summit', but a moment when 'a common vision will be set up'.
After all, North development should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuously following the vision of liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Just like the liberals who preceded us, we changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the constantly shaken topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting Jean Lesage's 50th anniversary of joining the party's lead.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to christen Beauharnois' headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who carried out the Calm Revolution and Nationalization of Water Electricity, to Bourass, who created James' Bay, our party managed to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At a press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When the line came for the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric plant, Charest emphasized that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his member base, thus giving a great deal of applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and undoubtedly not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling the elections in the autumn of this year, which allows him the law.
However, he stressed that his program was charged, especially by the federal council mission in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend convention provided the Liberals' chief with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially certain "trying to amend the constitution" that went very smoothly: PLQ (Québek's Liberal Party) requires particularly recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes Quebec to appoint part of the members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council who would have the right of veto in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
From the opposition side, the Plan North was adopted sceptically in its main features.
PQ Chief (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois re-launched the North Quebec Development Policy launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced fulfilling this policy.
If she had stuck to it, "we would have gone on today", Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) François Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"We wish, however, that this was not just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-ministr of "justice" (o irony) in Harper's cabinet who took the liberty of saying about Louise Arboure in the summer of last year that she represents "a shame" for Canada.
This insult to a woman who has waged a constant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says much about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, did not return to its homeland a national closed in Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that has no regard for the fact that by the time the actions he was accused of were committed, Omar Khadr was a young adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves to rot in inhumane conditions a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty international and in particular the Association of Canadian Lawyers advocate the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can look forward to a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little does it care that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, and this is undoubtedly permanent, after so many years of torment.
We do not realize this, but we are just witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the words that Harper is throwing around so much and that sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, trap him according to the will of the chief of a minority government so far (as will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party proclaiming Virtue, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what formed the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell discurs from Barrick Gold
In a September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the largest gold producer in the world has launched prosecutions of three authors and a poor little publishing house for libel in order to spark a "transparent public debate", demanding six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truth, especially in the case of prosecutions for libel, but the law.
It is no surprise that Garver is completely passing away this fundamental distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate to bring down anyone who dares defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very uneven fight with an army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of mining company.
After all, tactics in these unbalanced struggles often consist in the overthrow of defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will plug the mouth of the counterparty and, moreover, dismay anyone who dares to pursue this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of the whole thing to public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, Canada has a debate in normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas rather than in baton wounds.
Thus, mining companies were not enough to open up their books, their documentation, and establish real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and funding for independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and squeamishly reject petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada's book.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a 'public debate' and at the same time despise the opinion of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice president's world only refers to fat-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrowed concept of that term.
In democracy, even nacturers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because he rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to hear and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not as part of what many perceive as prosecutions in which the defendant is to be blocked by his mouth (as part of his prosecution of the "public debate" by the way, Barrick has just presented an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce to them that they should stop using this term...).
Apart from the surreal Garver speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of inquiry and the search for the truth that are essential to every democratic society.
Overall, he denies the right to citation of credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations that constitute the basis of intellectual activity itself.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without being subjected to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she followed the scientific standards used by Noir Canada's authors.
He has the right to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he has no desire to conduct a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would limit such a type of unauthorized prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, eventually reached agreement yesterday on the biggest bailout economic plan since the Great Crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan, using $700 billion to slow down the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms ensuring the repayment of the public money deposited, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to default and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday minutes after midnight, after the conclusion of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disruption of everyday American life will be huge," Republican Judd Gregg said.
During the last hours, negotiations have started at maximum speeds for fear of the effect of further failures to develop investors.
The time limit was to open the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. President were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed themselves rather in favour of the agreement, but did not neglect to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with supplementing the agreement on certain measures, in particular those aimed at allowing the owners to maintain their residence, and those on wages leading the labor state of the rescued companies.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take special measures due to the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate ourselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television waves.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The crude features I have read [showing] that it is something that we will all have to spend and with which it will be possible to move forward.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The aim of the 700-million-dollar plan is to buy out doubtful claims and risk and unsaleable assets from US financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after a 14-month crisis unleashed by a bursting housing bubble that first led to a collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a freezing of cash and in the dissolution of banks and financial institutions.
The decline in the first draft agreement last week was caused by Republican MPs.
From the moment the Democrats agreed that the government would only guarantee some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty, but not buy them, there is a belief that the impasse situation is averted.
In an effort to bring conflicting views closer together in Congress, a measure was added stating that the government would be able to introduce new fees to help her regain her deposit if, as a result of the program, she would have to assume losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add an additional 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in saved companies that, in the event of profits, will pay him dividends and which he will be able to sell again when this is over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for seizure of the properties associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits for the amount of valuation and compensation paid to the managers of the affected firms.
The designers of the plan would like to put him to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project in both Republican and Democratic camp.
"It is quite obvious that Washington can't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Financial Commission, declared to the electorate.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, profiting on taxpayers is not the answer."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the presenter of a group of congressmen dubbed "the Skeptic Committee", presents the whole matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and to scrutinize carefully which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis was a global crisis.
After the end of the emergency meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for EUR 11.2 billion (US$1.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from buying its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapsing since it lost €2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the risk-credit crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that is what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times."
On the other side of the Channel La Manche so far, the British government seems to have launched the nationalization of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than USD 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) constituted loans to buy real estate.
According to his announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy out the branches and accounts of British bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must nationalize from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of Socially Engaged Icons
His beauty with azure's eyes long represented his trump card, according to others' weakness.
Did this American actor break out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unceasing talent that was his own also distanced him from the power category that spawns true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of bold years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, whom he was similar to and had long been a kind of rival of his on film screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother native to Hungary.
One of the famous faces of the American dream was born from these European roots.
Without an exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country in love with a self-made mana, a fighter in the Pacific War, wounded in a battle that in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then attended New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theatre, on television, and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who ranked second to the 24 hour Le Mans race in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, despite being a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him they also leave the shady places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which forever remains to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused dizziness to film lovers, while his big roles compete on a black screen of memories.
After him, he defiles more than half a century of constantly changing American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) emerges in memory again, a young man who rejects his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, the 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From a less ancient past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a battered, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In a Sign of Hate) by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman made a real acquaintance in 1956.
A likable gangster in a totally great The Sting (Crap), Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
The bitter and vindictive billiard player in the amazing The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), the same character portrayal in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, bringing him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering forever, it was him.
And he again.
In his career, various epochs compete.
Young people know him primarily thanks to the iconic Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coen.
He then concluded his career as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends that left the craft quite soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, although he denounced Hollywood with his gilds, pompousness, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded him, not without humor, as "a living challenge to underplaying", judging that in his performances he pushed too hard on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a platter, the profession was not always so tender.
However, he played the first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate ones whose declines and rebellions reflected in his perfect traits.
As director, Newman revealed little known pages of his shy sensibility.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward starred, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness, dedicated to his son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose.
In the rush of honors that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former fellow fighter Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) grievedly stated, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Greatness, love of life, such are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Besides his legendary career, a great civil rights fighter, ecology, an independent film, opponents of Hollywood decline, is also leaving.
His likeness we used to see on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed rather tasteless to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Severe Childhood.
Newman thus, rather than letting himself be lulled by glory, had engaged in society until the last moment.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And for us, it was an honor to be able to watch the career of such a clairvoyant and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, October 8, the trial will begin in criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
Politician and his associates, among other crimes, including falsification of documents, are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organization, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often documented the fulfilment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and self-government - totalling approximately 65 million forints - went partly to Fiatal Ballodal's treasury, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The manner in which the investigating authority also informed the investigating authority was that the money received in the public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices which were not a real consideration and the undertakings accepted were never met by the associations.
According to the prosecution, much of the invoices were fake.
Forms for these invoices came from the Yozsefros market, round stamps were produced in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of which companies are to produce invoices were decided, among other things, on a tour route along the northern bank of Balaton, on which István Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was to look for the first-named boarding houses and restaurants.
In them, he requested accounts for his consumption, according to which the invoices submitted in public competitions were then produced by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and, respectively, the Self-government of the capital.
Most of the invoices were exhibited by István Lados with his associate András ‹rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the news needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip", Lados looked at a beerhouse.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its associates in 2003, this hospitality facility provided catering for a 90-member group from Biztos Pont.
However, according to the company manager, so many people would not suddenly fit into this facility.
Similarly, the formal and content errors of the invoice issued in the summer 2002 were swarmed with a foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Éveredért.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the fillers of forms with rich imagination went too far even when they mentioned the documents of a company dedicated to hospitality - Pigal s.r.o., in which according to the information provided to the state prosecutor, the documents in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear.
The head of Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him invoices, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to formalities, it was not agreed that they had accommodated a hundred people according to the invoice, because they have only eleven rooms which do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, food was also mentioned on the invoice, with their restaurant no longer working for a long time.
The eager invoice manufacturers did not even convince themselves that the Budapest travel agency only organises foreign travels and the invoice with cash payment, which also did not match the company's billing practice, said foolishly as a travel brokerage service in Hungary.
Moreover, as has been observed during the investigation, they also stated VAT in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
The four documents issued by Jobb Jövőért by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree with the amount of VAT. The company's activities are not covered by the 25 % but by 15 % VAT, in addition to which only printed invoices were issued by the hotel employees, but the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, the "Publishers" corrupted the invoice by stating, for example, one company, how it became apparent thanks to an investigation by the State's Attorney, as an activity carried out by road transport of goods, which was not originally carried out at investment consultancy.
Moreover, the invoices issued by the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and the association XXI. Szazadi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have also been falsely leaked due to formal deviations - not matching the format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or Sport Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the forgers did not notice that HIB s. r. o. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time of 2001 when a group from the Fiatal Városért Society was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had published the paper.
The invoices were exhibited consciously
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew they were to issue a fictional invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation issued accounts for roughly four million forints for the Harmadik Éveredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of Collab s.r.o., according to the indictment, forced one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account.
Zuschlag and its associates were also co-operated by Biogate s. r. o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied Jobb Jövőért Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth around five million forints, for which there was no actual economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of billing companies includes those that had ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was an authorized representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió s.r.o., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but on which the company is not found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment assets worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas Company Cash Investment s.r.o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was to pass documents relating to the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Éveredért and accepted their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubat, the Romanian masons were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him because, at the request of co-convicted attorney Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Cubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State's Attorney considered that Kubatov had come to 10% of the amounts shown on invoices and VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri k. t. to issue fictitious invoices, this time to tender for the company Biztos Pont.
The Y-Generatió and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszágért associations submitted proposals for the Mihálye Tancsics Foundation (TMA), a public service organization of the Socialist Party in January 2006.
They gained 500 thousand forints, but did not spend on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To make this clear, TMA submitted five fictional invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were also found during a house search at the office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, a portion of the defendants are likely to describe the production process of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His statement to date is not very detailed, and although he has already promised to explain everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the payment of much of the damage, fifty million forints, with him perhaps the Socialists have made a deal and Zusi will take over.
He may have been offended, after all, since his requests to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely to place him under house arrest, have remained unheard.
While the perpetrators of economic offences who have done much greater damage than they have not done so far can freely walk or at least wait for the end of the proceedings conducted against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people do not want to fall behind in the eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Research, using an experimental auction, attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in the stage auction, using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method being examined by active areas of the brain of experimental persons.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, the important element of which is to trump the other side, a whole under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to function intensively in losing.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "self-remuneration" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to researchers, price unscrewing can therefore be explained by trying to avoid a sharp reaction of the striatus.
To support their theories, members of the research team from the economists conducted a financial cross-cutting survey.
In doing so, three groups were citing against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product and they made bets.
In addition, members of another group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive $15 more for the reward.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost this money as well.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was all in all that one was stressed by winning and the other by losing.
However, members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the neurologist hypothesis.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
These have so far explained phenomena observable in auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Economic Faculty of New York University.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated, causing sick people often not to know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, typical of liver inflammation and jaundice, but the origins of the disease and the disease caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways, depending on the underlying diseases: hepatitis A and E to the digestive tract (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travelers should in any case be protected by vaccination against A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against a C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after taking an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal distress, urge to vomit.
After this, jaundice, light stool, and dark urine are produced on the skin and eye whites. The treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, millions of people around the world die of a more serious type of this disease, liver cancer, and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in 10 infected patients is treated medically.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected with their illness do not even know the cause of the disease destroys liver cells insidiously, so the first symptoms occur in many cases up to 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important to prevent early, implement regular deputations.
In three groups, this disease occurs a lot more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion prior to 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already prove routine laboratory testing, a person should contact his or her physician if he or she notices any sign of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the organism to prevent contagiousness and prevent cancer from occurring.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was organized by organizations representing the sick for the first time worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, to the causes of its formation and to the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn't hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God acts as an analgesic that could have facilitated the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, researching how faith in the god of pain affects man, informed the British daily Telegraph.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks while all observed the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
The technique of examining the human brain also showed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
Research is the first of a series of researches involving scientists, philosophers, and theologians from various parts of the university alongside academics.
The exact test took place by attaching a sparking instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which issued electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe the two paintings intently: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with the Edge of Leonard da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of Our Lady would create a certain state of piety among believers, while Da Vinci's image was chosen because they did not differ too much from the first and seem to make a calming impression.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received in four consecutive parts 20 electroshocks, while separately watching the picture with religious or general topics.
Catholics stated that when they looked at Our Lady, they felt "safe", as if they were "taken care of" and "calmed down, filled with peace".
In observing the painting with religious thematics, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard’s work before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved using any strongly impressive image even in atheists, just to find the right photograph.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they showed them some Madonna from Leonard or a painter of similar caliber.
Would the view of the quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
♪ You're what you share ♪
On their tenth birthday, Google may say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics making parallels with Orwell's dark vision are concerned, the very essence of web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently commented to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google founders to stick to their original intention, which was, "Let's get all the information in the world!"
According to the narrated Google representative, even after ten years of worldwide work, the company is only at the beginning of working with all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like, "What should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of job would it actually be good for me?" - but such seemingly simple questions will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all internet users know that search words are accurately captured during the internet search, as well as the IP address from which they were searched and what pages interested in the search were moved to.
Thanks to Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, retain the history of their surfing, see back what they were looking for and what they clicked on, thus generating in the long term findings adapted to them much more directly - the same logic will be based on Recommendations, through which the system will offer us products and services based on previously mentioned and maintained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - users who are afraid of Google data monopoly are asking.
In most cases, the scope of potential power represented by the company is threatening, the counter-reaction does not create the awareness of guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even rebellion against power in internet users.
However, it is confirmed that all the search terms are not only captured, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases personal rights of internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous example of recent times was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the community sites of Orkut, established through it.
However, internet users who are concerned about personality rights could still rest in May when the company, hand in hand with the Electronic Rights Protection Organization, has successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced, even in the future, by any article of the Constitution, to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms that it obtained with reference to strengthening the adopted Children's Protection Act years ago, yet failed to get lists of search items of individual users, respectively complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear the provision of their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be exposed to harm by their starting to use Google services, and they act against it with revolt, such as multinational companies with conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild branch, grouping around excited computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big companies, "corporation what's going on now", unlike its rival Microsoft, considered for Windows as conquerors of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money from them for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, more youthful, "cooler" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this can also be due to the fact that geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which brought with it just one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave behind clues and use the communication channels that we have at our disposal, and although their range is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which record music that he listens to, can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and he can also write a blog that automatically shows up his latest photo gallery, which he stores on Flickr or Picase.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of example cases from which she explains: a girlfriend in the morning when looking at the flood of photos of her mutual friends will easily find out who she was spending the evening with, or the company can fire her worker just because on her blog she recounts her sincere opinion of the top management: one thing is for sure, the notion of private life has been completely reconsidered today.
He who lives online consists of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (beginning, for example, Scroogle, who uses Google's search system, but does not deliberately leave traces).
For example, a small number of people do not register on community sites to be found. Online Google applications from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which do not create the highest quality profile possible.
Public opinion not too secretly expects Google to show teeth.
With its present value of $156 billion worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites threaten advertising agencies' investment, and services introduced at an ever-accelerated pace make life seriously uncomfortable not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software designers.
In addition, critical observers also find counterpoints that have a disturbing impression: for example, the senior management has completely rejected the employees' protests after raising to double the corporate kindergarten fee, any frequent daily dieting of employees was too expensive, according to the company’s management, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google still bowed to the Chinese government in 2006, and in the sense of their agreement, filtering out any finding that is against good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be skewed by the world in new places: while some believe that the Google project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscence a future in which one can draw frighteningly close to a person with only Google data.
A double killer from Ozda helped remove the tracks of two juveniles
Two juveniles interviewed police in the case of a double murder in Ózda, according to reasonable suspicion helped to remove the traces of this crime, said a spokesman for the High Police Directorate of Borsod County on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activity of which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding the offence.
Both juveniles, according to MTI's information two girls, are being prosecuted at large.
Aiding a crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozda, a 23-year-old male here, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a felony premeditated multiple murders for gainful reasons.
During the investigation, it became clear that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old man a greater amount.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his lender last Wednesday to a facility in Ozda, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man prepared to commit the crime beforehand, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder by a weapon hidden at the scene.
Both the weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Exchange made an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - the Warsaw Stock Exchange offered to buy a 100% package of Prague Stock Exchange shares.
Ludwig Sobolewski, Chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish Party despite the fact that the Czechs had already ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new Prague Stock Exchange owners.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer by Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to candidates for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börs have so far submitted an offer.
Prague Stock Exchange Chief Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 % of the shares could be sold out.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25% share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European leaves
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading newspaper already recalls "September 2nd".
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, accuses Roman La Repubblica. The President was not even able to sew his own party in support of the fast-tuned bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which resembled a billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about September 2nd.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
In El Mundo's opinion, the world economy was brought to the brink of its collapse by a lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system continues to increase, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Although the Bush plan was not perfect, after the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just at the moment when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, notes the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw a life-cycle into winding money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from failure.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither money nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, Member States of the European Union need to move over their national egoism and unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, stagnant monetary constitutions received more than EUR 100 billion, recalls the Vienna Der Standard, which concerns that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to go deep into the pocket to address the crisis, even more real.
The European Union has not yet seriously dealt with the crisis that, as a tsunami, has swept through the old continent.
"Rescuers" need not immediately wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good for them to establish in which case it is reasonable to seek taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent Car Imitates Bumblebee Flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collision, if not imitation of barriers detectors occurring in the world of nature?
Bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of the surprise project, presented at the Japan fair CEATEC, was inspired by engineers from Nissan bumblebees. It was about how to build a new generation of collision prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan designed a biomimetic robotic system of BR23C-type management, a robotized minicar that is equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate any precipitation.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety protective cover," Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technological PR and research and development.
Composite eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see into all directions at a visual angle of more than 300 degrees.
Engineers were able to copy the function of the folded eye after the idea of a laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 metres in front of BR23C in a 180 degree field of vision, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into an operation aimed at preventing collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotized car begins to mimic the movements of the bee and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in an absolutely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, a robotic car could not respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
They must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety cover, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not last longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotation, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, an instinctive, intelligent response is important, not the processing ability, the less data storage.
This mechanism must only process and respond to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to preserve them and respond using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, therefore he is constantly using only a memory of the size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with a giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing an immediate avoidance technology that, according to Nissan's estimate, could reach serial-produced vehicles within ten years.
Another option of application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified final target after avoiding obstacles.
Damn dear child already has a name.
The $700 billion bailout bill, to be divided into several instalments and aimed at buying out low-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended on Saturday after midnight of American Eastern Time, Congressional officials reached an agreement within a few days of the ongoing $700 billion bailout debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, according to which only the signing of the agreement remains.
The compromise regarding the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson stated about the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and it will be effective, but further action must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8:00 p.m. Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
The House of Representatives will vote first on Monday, then it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then news of the deal was also welcomed at the White House.
"With the progress made last night, we are satisfied and very much appreciate both sides' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
After all, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which was intended to make the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities spend an entire sum of $700 billion at once.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of $700 billion in the first round, by using 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to decide on Monday, and the Treasury will buy mortgage-backed securities, which are rated as unquality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president's decision.
The program will be controlled by a special corps, the member of which will also be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on Congress' next decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply the combined tactics within the meaning of the Act: it can simultaneously buy off poor-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "poison" loans.
The purchase can take place within auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the Ministry have informed.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance grants them a guarantee for means of providing cause for concern, for which the company will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to meet the urgent demands of the U.S. financial system to spend up to $700 billion, whether it is a large purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the large cash institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, the heads of banks that have come into trouble and are waiting to help the state can count on the government to cut their severance payments - which is simply called a "gold parachute" in overseas slang.
Only in certain cases will their payment be limited, and these restrictions will depend on the mode of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys as part of the auction, a tax mark will be imposed on gold parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of a direct buyout of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the money for leadership is not excessive.
It should be added that the already existing gold falling treaties will not change, the restriction concerns only new ones, which is intended to further stimulate participation in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history to have legal restrictions in force regarding the remuneration of CEOs," commented Chairman of the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
Moreover, the state in the banks participating in the programme will be entitled to a share, thereby reducing the taxpayer's risk, because once the economy and the saved bank are on their feet, they can also make a profit from the transaction.
The proposal's plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
Of course, there have also been voices on both sides expressing doubt in relation to the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this will not protect taxpayers' dollars," said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur judges that the adoption of the provision was urged by precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened 1.7 percent in relation to the euro in one month, then 7.1 percent in relation to the dollar, increased 7.5 percent in relation to the euro in comparison to the euro in August 2007 and 15.9 percent in relation to the dollar.
Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force around 12 January, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "it is almost all that matters now if an electronic system of travel authorisation, or checks, is built over the sea in time".
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system would not include permission to enter, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
As of today, the representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington.
She will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will pass the Middle Cross to the Star of the Order for Merit on the Republic of Hungary and will conduct interviews with foreign policy advisors to the presidential candidate Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are both for the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major U.S. parties, assured the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but they are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a few days of marathon meeting of Congress and officials of the administration was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement was reached on the bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims to re-melt the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are consistently called more suitable of both candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls simultaneously with how they came to the forefront of the economic issue, Obama regained some advantage, and McCain's lead disappeared, which secured Sarah Palin's nomination for vice president after the Republican convention.
Obama expressed hope on Sunday at the Detroit Election Assembly that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act immediately, responsibly (...) to your places, savings, the entire industry, the stability of the entire economy is in danger," he said in front of a 35 thousand crowd.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain explained in an interview provided by ABC television station: "It's going to be a little bit abhorrent (...) but doing nothing is simply not a way."
As the Republican Senator said, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission overseeing the Minister of Finance and the severance pay limits for senior officials he insisted on.
Obama stated for CBS station that McCain did not have a more substantial role in the negotiations, he himself was with the minister in daily contact.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill on Monday, perhaps.
Overview of German language field printing
The right-wing camp is intact, only voters inside became more confident - so it analyzes the weak CSU result in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the Red-Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic CSU defeat in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers".
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU erosion began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over its office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and it is these modern citizens that are now turning away from them.
The alternation of the period is a problem for all Christian democracy, and thus for Angela Merkel.
The debate was not entirely surprising for CSU, but the trial ended on Saturday, which could be expected for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
As early as ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag election, i.e., still in the often observed Stoiber period.
The reason for this is the modernisation that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which eats up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the pace. Secularization, education results, settlement of Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without consequences on CSU voters' loyalty.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political implications.
Right-wing camp is intact, only voters inside became more confident, more critical, more willful.
It is also obvious that in recent weeks CSU has been the most distant classical civil layers; people in a free profession, businessmen, individuals with graduation and undergraduate education.
CSU’s support has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Viennese daily in its article entitled "Who, with whom? Party leaders are restrained on coalition issues" focuses on the confused internal political situation arising as a result of the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to deal with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the interference of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the greens do not yet want to negotiate on the coalition.
The election is over, now everything revolves around the coalition; in a debate held on public television, the party chairmen did not get much insight into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to deal with ÖVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in social partnership it exists.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted at every fall.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer responded carefully to the red bids.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Fayen tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether his party chooses opposition or enters the coalition is completely open in the party so far, these issues need to be discussed decisively within ÖVP.
The president of BZÖ Jörg Haider again seemed open to all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black Coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóková: A vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equality Summit, hosted by France, the current President of the European Union, began in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the professional debate in her message addressed to the plenary, turned her attention to segregation in education, as she is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their application.
On behalf of the French Presidency, Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, launched the summit conference.
The discussion was held among invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs of the Fidesz Járóková movement, she pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in recruitment, Romani people are forced out of the European labour market mainly due to their low education.
"The vast majority of young Romani people do not have high school education and due to poor quality of basic education can achieve a higher degree of education only a tiny part of them."
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the implementation of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Romani children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, it is necessary to confirm the consciousness of these contexts in the widest circles - between Romani and non-Romani children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chance he will have to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes, they contribute to the national budget.
"Romania is the right of their citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the Member, the cohesion of the European Union is needed, with emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, in order to accelerate the desegregation processes of schools immediately, this is crucially important for correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Romani children must be given the opportunities given to democratic space to participate as full-time citizens in the future of Europe," Járók demanded.
Everyone is guaranteed the European Equal Opportunities Year objective of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to eliminate discrimination set out at the level of Europe and of individual Member States.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the serving duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the tops of the Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and Earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress last October weekend.
In any case, members of a highly criticized duo have been heard that they will not cling to their posts with all their strength.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Foundary tsunami" to derive personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, still under Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the top of her career - the Christian-social union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but she was only up to 43.4 percent.
CSU was in Bavaria producing 18 percent of German GDP "self-governor" for 46 years.
While conservatives in the southern Federal State, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to have a high position, they will in any event be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first features of the reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of a narrow intelligence team that will open a probe meeting on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the Liberal FDP, or with a right-wing group of Free Voters, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered possible by Huber's successor.
Ironically, Gabriele Pauli, whose appearance against Stoiber used the Huber-Beckstein duo to perform the coup, then made a mercilessly short trial with an ambitious municipal politician, was the candidate of the Free Voter.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role will also fall to Stoiber, who until now has been spinning strings from behind, the former Prime Minister of the country and the former CSU chairman called 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some snarky remarks to the address of the CDU, according to him they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning also for CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the 2005 national success, will somehow stand up together.
According to Merkel, who was hard to hide her disappointment due to the fiasco, CSU's loss of positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin's major coalition.
This is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU, and the social democrat crisis will continue.
The SPD reached a peak in Bavaria with 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenka:opposition - 110:0
In the Sunday elections, not one opposition MP made it to the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained according to Russian observers by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSSE) by the illegalities that occurred at the vote census.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million-year-old country has lacked opposition well for ten years, the opposition, combined under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections, had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had retained several opposition MPs in parliament following the amendment of the constitution in the 2006 elections with the debateable course, would have his presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time.
The ODS thus dropped even the previously considered boycott.
In the background of opposition expectations, it was that Belarus was increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which wished to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the increasingly expensive Russian natural gas import, credit was taken and contributed to Beltransgaz, which owns pipelines through the country, wished to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment rated as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians were not given entry permits.
The release previously pointed out that the OSCE placed emphasis on positive shifts in the evaluation of the election campaign and not on shortcomings - such as banning candidacy for a third of the opposition candidates.
But the OSCE's Monday flash report already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present with a census of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can still be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to embark on small confrontations with Moscow, as he continues to refuse to recognise the detached South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has considered these two territories to have been independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that a dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to keep it that way, despite the fact that "she was too afraid to go into a meaningless parliament by a single member of the opposition".
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, the opposition leaves must be printed in Russia, the distribution is hindering local authorities, but I can still see that more and more people are supporting change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not see the right or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'inducing the silence of the cemetery' collapses," says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition politics, Russian observers regarded elections as democratic.
The Head of Mission of the Community of Independent States Sergei Lebedev to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti said that "people do not believe words, but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in Chigi Palace history that a revolving door was introduced on arrival and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new measure will begin to work against the shrewd, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee at work hours.
The news against the lazy was introduced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the President's Council, Mauro Masi.
"A revolving door - says Brunetta – is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presences and more services", states the Minister.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will open.
This is about reformism", emphasises Brunetta.
By Chigi Palace, we will complete implementation in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "This was a joint procedure with the workers and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning".
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister eventually announces that within three months, the absence of public employees for the disease decreased by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people per year at work".
And it will add that it is necessary for Italian public administration to become more efficient
"Its payday dynamics – explained by the minister – have doubled in the last 8-10 years due to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees met to reject Brunett's decree standards in accordance with a request supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Administration today introduces figures relating to a lower absence from work due to illness – writes the Consumer Protection Association – a nation of 'drinking lazy people' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public administration employees gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree".
Taru will be protested, in particular, against the exclusion of sickness allowance, which depends on the activity; the extension of the period in which the sick person can be checked for the time limit in which checks will be carried out, and against the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Resolut Prevention"
Every day there are 2,500 accidents at work in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have roughly 1,200 deaths due to accidents at work.
These values indicate the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly twice the deaths compared to the murders.
In order to re-invigorate the attention of institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil celebrates today in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Accidents set on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of labour safety is", confirms President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, National Association for Mutilated and Disability for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his vivid admiration for the constant joint efforts to protect workers, protect the victims' families and participate in public opinion."
"Of course, outraged 'enough' has been raised, honestly shared in the face of tragedies that create a stir in the media and public opinion, but daily reality again offers dramatic cases, even recurring in its dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem here: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
A number of educational initiatives are of particular importance so that young people facing the world of work become more aware.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up due to its worrying social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed from his side "how the phenomenon of death as a result of a work accident creates an absolutely critical social condition, as it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make convincing efforts towards the necessary termination of this condition.".
"As for the data of accidents at work, they appear to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from accidents at work is alarming anyway", again remarked President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't exactly want this 'reduction effort' to lead to less attention, because just as the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that in general there is too little to stop the problem of accidents and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of worker training, right from the school age".
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added – in terms of communication and co-participation of public opinion.
But, above all, a greater sense of responsibility by employers towards the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon is needed.".
Mercandelli eventually stated that this was a progressive degeneration of the right to compensation levels anticipated for labor victims and "the displacement of supportive care" to which the system has been getting in recent years."
"The goal is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added – because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or giving from time to time by the legislature".
Mp3 players charged, hearing put at risk
Listening to loud music for a longer time and using portable music instruments as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission announcement published today, which quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) Eu, in an official report extended in Brussels.
"From this scientific opinion – we read in notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years using portable music instruments, weekly over an hour a day and keep the machine at high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing ability".
"I am concerned that so many young people who use often portable music instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way", admits Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings – leading – indicate a clear risk and need to respond quickly.
The most important thing is that we must encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine the already existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding in order to make them completely effective and to keep up with the new technology".
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists – closed down executive official Eu – confirm the need to worry, and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be implemented to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, the originator of which are portable musical instruments and similar devices".
There is currently a safety European standard that limits noise levels of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns are increasing about hearing damage that may be due to excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damage by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable music instruments, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours per week, exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to maximum permitted workplace noise.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and the amount of such devices can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will let the Commission take its course for the future of the capital
We'll start today, close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the "Commissions for the Future of the Capital of Rome" workers who met this morning at their new headquarters behind Caracalla Spa.
In six months President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 commission members will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will assess the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and its councillor Gianni Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to highlight Alemanno – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political arbitrators, which remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
It is not about any exchange of functions, but only about trying to have some place to process a large project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then disbanded, because this institution must have an exact deadline.
In June – the Mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome".
Whoever accuses the Commission of unnecessaryness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will say, "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are good, like the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
All too often, politics is scattered over everyday problems and the urgency that occurs from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither a useless business nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not cost either the euro and will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level it necessarily needs, and to think with a united spirit of its future.".
The future, which, specified by the Mayor of Rome, "will not only be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status the capital, but "it will also include the role that Rome can and must exercise as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A well-known U.S. president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as a private citizen today) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady posted on the website, "This guy is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he will make it to the highest position of the nation, which had all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the electorate's question: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; they all say Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act on the heart and not on the brain.
One Mississippi newspaper, from the bowels of the South of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling booth, we know well who the American patriot will give his vote to.
One side of American mentality, which remained soaring until the last moment, comes out of the draft.
Say what you want, eventually we'll take care of it ourselves, who to tick, whether Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent it home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became, for most Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes the place of Georgia W will have to do a huge task.
The US economic collapse was felt by journalists as well: there is an investigation period in the newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, now almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the polls did not openly say that they had less concern about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
Money is the problem for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the paper, are a huge problem.
According to asked journalists, this is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists of press and executive seniors believe that journalism on a national scale is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishing works their way to the Internet, which many view as "killer" printing.
"Economic pressure", to which journalists point out, increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred polled journalists admitted to resorting to technology in the hope that they would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who manage newsrooms – that is, leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value decreases to 23%.
This has something to do with "work security."
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are at national level 47%.
As far as journalists go, they're at 30%.
As for "certain work" related to personnel (our editors, ndr) in America is still on a daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a vast nation as Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and Internet employers often offer what they want, so it is a question of taking or leaving.
Managers receive almost always huge salaries, and the editor can also earn $10,000 a month outside of pension and insurance payments.
As regards holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: TRIBE IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYING IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of a businessman with the realities of Daniel Coppola, who asked to move from his city, Grottaferraty, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the counteroffer at the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During his own-cost trial, he received a home arrest release last week, which was converted into forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur could change the place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he expressed his pm) would allow him to influence his society and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon was manifested days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan presented to the White House: a large part of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is also confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis splits up the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, more moderate, accommodating to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to "those from Washington" and the world of finance, strong primarily in states in the middle and south.
A soul that was arrogantly manifested by the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this just quoted thing is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but all over the west, and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to function as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time in the new climate and which are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is re-update, extraordinary market recovery, double category State-power in relation to a certain renationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis in the bank's financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country are mainly included, in a single state.
At the same time, this created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis seems economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political inter-nation seems to be substantially out of the picture or that it has little power to add: the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and various state strategies, has given obvious evidence and cannot decide on one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: at the moment we get into trouble, only states have economic resources, a lot of financial resources to be able to try to put things right.
And they also possess the necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have to have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, moreover, in complete harmony with the ever-increasing importance of which the latest economic advances try to attribute to one factor closely linked to it: territorial affiliation.
Ironically, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom of Sita, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finances were already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little material things as water, grain, diesel.
All things that would have said could be transported from one place to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the bounded space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards up his sleeve than who isn't and who's unlucky enough to live in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it predicts a break.
Who talks about territory, state, government, inevitably talks about politics, i.e. leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, awareness that there is objectively a need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who could take on the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leadership, especially economic, that proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence, which seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For it seems that it is becoming increasingly widespread in the broad masses of the population of belief, rather than their actions being the same as those of the so far popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to remove ruling classes and traditional political order manifests itself in the sudden electoral "defences" or in unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of Labour in the UK, to the rebellion of U.S. Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also has to do with it).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have ever greater problems to understand, i.e. represent, which, not from now on, is being created in deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially too lame.
Before this it would be excessive to speak of a permanent "mass revolt".
But I'm sure we can't say it means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep the stokilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of just 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published the discoveries of some University researchers in Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf pipe.
«The base of glue can be imagined as a series of pipes laid as an arranged pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists inspired themselves with the feet of gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that enable the animal to ensure a perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles while "it simply sticks away from the wall» explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Engineering Faculty of Dayton University.
"This material could be useful as makeshift glue" will deliver Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers think of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices because dwarf carbon tubes are heat and electricity conductors.
Other applications could relate to aerial space engineering .
No super heroes for now.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also involved in research into new glue.
In an article in American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced micro-fiber-shaped glue as hair that cleanses itself from dust by moving around the area to maintain perfect attachment.
Medications: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are mainly consumed in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the amplification or reduction of effectiveness with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, Professor of Western Ontario University in London to highlight the risks of juices both prepared and fresh in combination with the ingestion of some drugs, at the now ongoing 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia raises a new alarm: just one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects and expose patient health to risk.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to the toxic level the effects of some anti-arithmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolithics, antihistamines and neurological medicines.
PRACTICES AT RISK– The Italian Medical Agency itself announced it in an information bulletin two years ago and prompted doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take drugs, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that dampen drugs.
Long list of effects dampened by grapefruit and other juices.
From there Michele Carruba's call, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately announced to various international and national pharmacies agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative lists of medicines you receive and if you run into anything unclear, do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» stressed an expert for Ansa.
Nobel for Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in foreign, economic and political action of the Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, on the days when Enron collapsed, Krugman predicted in one comment released in the New York Times that the second event would, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States, be much more important than the first.
A prediction that sparked a few polemics and has been blamed on him for years, but which proved accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman stated in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank Executive Committee, Krugman is "an economy of great importance", but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, particularly critical of Bush's liberalist administration's excesses".
Open Office, we have a third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production that aims to penetrate to more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more known Microsoft Office.
After about one year's work by volunteer workers, controlled by Sun Microsystem, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with various news: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window, additional, much more substantial, such as compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office package 2007, Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft file extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Special features of some models are interesting, such as what allows to reduce PowerPoint presentation dimensions, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility of transferring the PDF folder to the graphic design model and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have spreadsheet or text program properties.
Cooperation is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: in excellence it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program, each coworker is assigned one colour to comment to make a clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should reinvent the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which has been located on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also the installation cd can be sent home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the topic of freeness can be a tool to expand in households, it is the Open Office business area that makes a lot of money, and it can already count on all kinds of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized firms, which could open up business perspectives.
The Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, ultimately, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this assumed number can even be surpassed.
Also Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third graded and top-classed T-shirt winner.
The report was quoted by the pages of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Cere, Epo the third generation, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, even him from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those carried out in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positivity of Ceru, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the determined two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl's positivity on Epo's third generation is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government authorities of the outcome.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Saster and American Cadel Evansem, also winning a punt T-shirt of the best climber.
Imigrants:NEW YORK TIMES AFFAIRS, IS ITALIE A RASIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants only in the last house has turned into the priority target of immigrants" adopted with opposition.
Does it turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is how they enquire in a long article of the New York Times, which dedicated this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre native to Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times define by "paradox of the north": Northern areas are simultaneously those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by Legou, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinala, asked the state and church to work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the union for tenants, rent a single room a student can cost in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The phenomenon has already reached such dimensions that entire layers of students have lost their right to study due to overall too high prices that their families would have to bear – explains Sunia studios head Laura Mariani – in this city, the large demand from students has warped the market in such a way that it has fueled the process of price increases that have spread to residents as well".
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts freely, unregistered, without limited rent, associated with sublet.
Sunji needs an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices through the revision of taxes.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, there is a need for about 450 euros per bed, a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (bande Nere zone) to a median value of 800 (Lambite, Udine and Fiera zones) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, you need 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in double beds.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples there is a bed of 300/450 euros, a room of 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones of Poliqulinico, Vomero and Colli Ameni.
In Bari they want EUR 250/350 per bed, at least 350 per single room.
Prices are definitely lower in smaller cities, but they have greater impacts on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rent is the most common phenomenon for students from outside the European Union, one other anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students, compared to Italian students.
Farewell to old cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historical halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of Multiplex.
"City without cinema is like blind, like face without eyes."
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian urban centers, as well as rural towns.
The process of curtailing cinemas, the birth of large multisals in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monosals in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of genuine cultural crime.
Often historical places with memories disappear," it is as if we lost a friend, a friend we shared a journey with and a lot of emotion», feels the director of the New Paradise Cinema, a film that 20 years ago won Tornator Oscar and a great jury award in Cannes, and who recounted the poetry of one village cinema and sadness over the way the cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 cinemas of the traditional tip closed, and the highest account was paid mainly by halls in the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torín, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures is Emilia-Romagna with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsibility for their disappearance is the onset of multiplex, these three Italian regions, which registered the highest number of new cinema multisals: 195 canvases more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romana.
«The Italian procedure has evolved irrationally» claims Paolo Protti, President of Anec," it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to relocate to a multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about insufficient subsidy on the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is around EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a disgrace that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, between 16 million euro and 18 million euro per year would be needed».
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protoculum between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax relief in favour of operators and the benefits for audiences in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to drive into a zone with limited traffic and will have special prices to stop and at some parking lots.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
Defending a traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a spark that convinced me to establish a "New cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before Rialt or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotion that I do not have to look at signs blackened with dust, I turn to the other side».
The link between politics and mob 'ndrangheta, mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"Mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to modify city council elections to the interests of Mafia Piromalli group".
The charges that the Directorate against Mafia in Calabria raise against Mayor and Vice Mayor Gioie Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrioe e Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning due to external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are heavy.
In cuffs, too, Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between clan and public administration, and his grandson's attorney, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mob character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"Ignoring all legal and moral standards as well as common sense", state representatives write when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay consultations to Piromalli's attorney.
"That would allow the Mafia group – written by judges – to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate already huge possibilities of controlling and managing public administration".
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and organized criminal underworld are a lot in his county: "There are areas in which the concentration of the Mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are unavoidable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndranghets, heroes who are still spotless'.
The imprisonment of this morning follows the imprisonment of July last year, by which police showed that the Mafia Piromalli group had received a final hit.
As of late April last year - the Gioii Tauro City Council has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for this was the supposed connection between organised crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of their office in municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of Christian Democrats, who at the moment of dissolution was elected head of the right- Wednesday coalition after a narrower election in May.
He screamed over the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called to account the then Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of conspiring everything for political reasons, but judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that the Mafia group had even grown so far as to ask for a change in the A3 motorway project.
From further interrogations directed against Dal Torrio, written by public prosecutors, it became apparent "the willingness to move the claims of an entrepreneur, a representative of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and adapt the public administration election to the interests of the Mafia group.".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It is an infinite bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the eyes of colossals such as Chevron now try to extend his hands to these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price declined around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went aside, but now the environmental organization and the new oil price increase gave the sector a new impetus.
World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that approximately 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
this amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centers.
Plus, there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron studies ocean energy technology – spokeswoman of one company that is connected to the United States oil colossus, in Wall Street Journal's economic daily newspaper – has commented on the possibility of working with us".
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to mine oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so far invested sums, although not known in detail, show increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology that is still in the early stages because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
In the meantime, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy generation, more-impacted technologies must be used for the dilution.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are linked to each other.
The force of waves that moves with buoys up and down is changed using cylinders and tops to hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
Pressure turns the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
The energy reaches shore by underwater cables.
For now, there are four facilities of this type at the project stage that are only waiting for federal approval and some of the energy could serve military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already generating energy for a shopping mall and parking lot by using six Pyria turbines in the East River of New York.
The flow of water during the tide and outflow is caused by the rotation of turbines, which by this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant expressed that they had a long list of clients waiting for necessary authorization due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point merits the potential of tides and tides, they say at the Institute for Energy Research.
Although this is an incoherent factor, the tides and tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
Just into the energy of the influx and outflow, states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, as well as other coastal states have already invested $7.1.5 million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
