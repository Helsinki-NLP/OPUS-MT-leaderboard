Barack Obama gets the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president
US President Barack Obama arrives at Oslo for 26 hours to take the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American president in history.
The diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million will be given to him, among other things, for an exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets five committee members for the first time, who selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then schedule a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
This afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremonial ceremony at which Obama will take over the prestigious award.
He'll get it as the fourth U.S. president, but only third to win the prize right in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan War when accepting the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, the war effort was increased by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which he will not forget to highlight by any of his critics.
During the ceremony Obama will also receive a gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's going to put them on for charity, but he hasn't decided on a particular charity yet.
The charged program then introduces the president with a wife to the banquet, where in addition to the Norwegian king and queen there will also be a prime minister and another 250 invited guests.
Obama was more restrained from the beginning to the price.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it was not just for him, but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that he was "a challenge to action".
Nature's protector accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police accused the chairman of the civil association of the Society of Conservation of Nature Litoměřice of extortion.
In several cases in the last year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, for withdrawing the appeal he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said litomeric police spokesperson Alena Roma.
Lubomír Studnička is chair of the Litomerical Society of Conservationists.
Now he's in custody, and he's facing up to three years in prison.
The sorting containers of Brno don't smell very good
In Prague, ordinary people can sort containers from beverages, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to take a few minutes before you find the right trash cans.
I don't want to say that in Brno the waste would not be sorted at all.
But it seems to me that for the second largest city in the Republic, the councillors are under-interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only by the fact that as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but mainly by the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried dumping a PET bottle in a collection bin at the center?
It's a good look, it just takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I've come across so far is in Moravské náměstí opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but it doesn't feel so damn good to me.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort out trash like that.
Out of laziness.
It's a long way from the garbage cans.
I don't blame them.
I volunteered myself after the party to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored trash cans on Kounic Street in sight.
Luckily, on my way to the shalina, I came across the right place.
But the garbage was overflowing.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps the city represents most, right?!
But ecology and aesthetics don't seem to be much of a concern for the Brno socialists.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extraliga, which will embarrass us all over the country, than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort other ingredients for purer Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm my assumption with official statistics after a while on the Internet.
According to the data of EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the South Moravian Region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After the left has added, despite government opinion to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or construction savings.
But also interest on government debt or international litigation.
This will add problems to those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists promoted the increase to some groups, they relied on sensitive spending, pensions, or sickness to borrow additionally. "It's just a postponement of problems to the future, pitting mines," Janota says.
In fact, the money borrowed pays an increasing amount of interest and sometimes it has to come back.
The state doesn't have much of a choice where to get it.
If it does not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, it must raise taxes.
To everyone the left has now added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later their children too.
Pensions or sick leave, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people don't have to worry, they get them.
However, at the cost of becoming more indebted – the next year, not just 163 billion will be missing in the box office, but more.
In spite of the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow more rapidly and along with the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternal VAT, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Because of the money transfers in favour of several groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mostly already competed and expanded sections, which can not be re-designed and possibly discounted.
At most, preserve, which is also not free.
This means delay or stopping thirty large buildings, the drawing of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD suggested that the loss of money will be solved in Solomonian – it will reach into CEZ dividends, which the state owns most of them, and will add to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is definitely not a bottomless source.
Last year, 18 billion arrived from ČEZ into the budget.
Each year, the dividends pay for the destruction of environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP under EU rules.
But this is not the end of the carnival of relocations.
Almost three billion were lost in the budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or to expenses for litigation, even for construction savings.
If the state can do without this money, it's not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota notes.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing from the already launched two-billion-dollar Treasury project, which is intended to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities spend on.
The first leg will start in January.
If the finance minister hadn't found the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
Americans are counting on a mobile phone, on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The uncovered plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android within seconds.
This is exactly what the American VMware company aims to do, focusing mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to maintain two user profiles on your phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at one and the same time, indicated by Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first performed a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully performed a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, to which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems also ran alongside each other.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware cooperates with European and American smartphone virtualization operators and should reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains troubles hoteliers
The bare slopes are not only concerned about the Krkonose skiers.
The missing snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore there are still available rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains.
Visit to our site we have a great deal.
People are going through offers, getting prices, but so far, they're afraid to order hard.
And if they call us, they immediately ask whether this year's Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants a New Year's stay in Špindleruv Mlyn exactly according to their expectations should not hesitate with the order.
Who prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is in second place with him, he can still try to wait a few days.
So far, dirtler's hoteliers offer mostly only weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to turn them in for a while, but then they're going to let them in for a shorter period.
And then the free rooms will be rapidly dwindling," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter terms are still offered by the Vrchlabe travel agency Ingtours.
Right now, we're most interested in a Christmas week that hasn't been sold out yet.
About half of the seats in our offer remain vacant.
That is why we have prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Krkonose Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabe Travel Agency, but there are fewer places available.
The first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed in during the week, Christmas will sell out too," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little better than last year to occupy the rooms of Hotel Horizon in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent better off.
We have the last few seats on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in January and February is also well sold," said the director of the best hotel in the Czech Republic, Karel Rada.
Of the eighty percent of the New Year's stays are also booked at the hotel Omnia near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, half the beds remain available at the latest Janskospa hotel for Christmas.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, which we already have about sixty percent of the population at the moment.
A little weaker so far is February, but once the snow hits, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, according to the director of Hotel Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, for a larger piece of snow, the Krkonose hoteliers still have to miss their appetite.
It's supposed to cool on Thursday, if there's any rainfall, there should be snow in the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, informed Jiří Jakubský from the Hradecký workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is comic, with what kind of schoolwork effort Barack Obama, the president with a reputation as smartest, repeats on the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself considered to be the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly anticipated Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it through a copycat from Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only does he use the word turnover "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to use the name Bush's January 2007 statement as the name of his own declaration: "A new way forward".
In doing so, he himself criticized Bush's idea three years ago to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by civil war as "unresponsible and in his aftermath a catastrophic decision".
However, the following months have shown that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of field commanders was the only possible and highly successful enough that there is no talk of Iraq in news relations today.
It did not improve Bush's reputation, but he objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting position than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will repeat itself.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, in particular by Afghan operations commander General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordinating practices, harshly criticized hesitant shooters at the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't find anything better, so at least he cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to squeeze another 5,000 out of Europe, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic thing about Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. Obama’s whole doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half-hearted increases will yield the same fruit as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite sign - no one can be relied on and no agreements are followed.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces used to change masters every day are poorly prepared, depending on how convenient it is for them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain a potemkin village for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to be rampant.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely difficult given the inaccuracies of circumstances that complicate Pakistan and Iran’s influences even more.
Even building an "actable state", which is the minimalist objective of the entire operation, does not seem too real.
Obama's strategy's time horizon is striking with voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent into war for the purpose of "early return home" will cause a miracle here, only the soul can truly romantic, untouched.
Politically speaking, determining the date of withdrawal is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will view this as an indirect confession of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that Europeans’ willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is coming to a loss.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of Hindukush.
Another factor capable of radical intervention is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions do not affect Iranians, a difficult question will arise before the United States as to whether or not to try to solve the problem by military force.
The answer will need to be at a time when Obama says America will proceed to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only Band-Aid for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time left to come up with another strategy if this proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash rewards
High executives of the US Goldman Sachs bank will not receive cash rewards this year.
It was announced by the firm, which responds so sharply to criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive shares instead of money that can be sold in at least five years.
In addition, shares can be taken from managers if they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus takes the lead in trying to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former investment banker to JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after spending nearly $17 billion (nearly 300 billion) on rewards for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total remuneration in the company for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of the announced measure today.
With the coming of the financial crisis, high remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political issue in many countries.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to charge 50 percent of the tax once more to bankers' bonuses exceeding £25,000 (about CZK 712.000).
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
The record-breaking five women today in Stockholm took over from the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden Gustaf this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature.
Alongside the four scientists among them was the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry award was given to Israeli Ada Jonath along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize for Economics, which was won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for economic governance analyses.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes, or astronomical telescopes.
Each award-winning took over a diploma, Nobel Medal, and a financial reward certificate.
For each category, it reaches 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million CZK).
If they are more distinguished in each, they share the reward among themselves.
Traditionally the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, for he is only at the beginning of his course and, moreover, is at the forefront of a country that runs two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policies, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to fight peace, although the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will see Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering staying in government because he does not agree with the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget, and perhaps even Janoto's staying in the cabinet, will be the themes of their Friday meeting.
The budget also criticizes Klaus.
According to him, his deficit is too high, which further deepens the public finances crisis.
The meeting was informed by the President's spokesman, Radim Ochat.
Janota wants to discuss his further tenure in office on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus is now getting to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, however, the House approved the Left's proposals for money transfers and increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of social democracy for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
A sharp intra-political dispute arose between the left on one and the government, Klaus and the right on the other because of which a question mark begins to float over the further work of Fischer's office cabinet, which was agreed by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party in spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially eliminating the package of austerity measures that Fischer's government pushed through in the fall and which it believes is to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the State Budget Act, stated at today's discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had been neglecting the 'serious problem', which is 'untenable deficit' of public finances for a long time.
He doesn't think he has a good solution today.
Only a strong government, which could also lean on a broader consensus of political parties, could bring about an improvement, is meant by the President.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is frightening and the government should consider further existence.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the office cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Greens apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer called similar words "strong statements" in response.
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek by saying that a terrible budget deficit, which the former Topolánek government prepared for this year, exceeds CZK 200 billion.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD marked the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
People were also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's news
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, about its struggles and victories despite some criticisms that American actors portray the main roles.
The story tells of sports, racial relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story represents Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that 21-year-old Mandela asked him to portray him in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, a 72-year-old actor who won the role award in Eastwood's boxing drama The Million Dollar Baby has portrayed, for example, the leader of the slavery abolition movement, which eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the US, and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
A former South African statesman has been in prison for 27 years for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released to freedom in 1990 and then became president of the country for four years.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
Invictus is a Latin word for undefeated and is the name of the poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains divided after apartheid both racially and economically.
He believes he can join his people through sports, so he decides to unite rugby players who are worldwide among outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it as close to reality as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I squeeze your hand, I take your energy, it transmits, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon portrays in François Pienaar's film, captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
In the end, the big surprise was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember when I rang the house bell, he opened it to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the distinct differences in actors' characters compared to their actual patterns led by director Eastwood, Invictus received: Undefeated Positive Reviews and they are also talking about Oscar ambitions.
Daily Variety's film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his ratings in the words, "He was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive ratings.
The secret of the glow over Norway deciphered: The Russians tested the rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was unsuccessful again, and the missile referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming both the black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the proper effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava mostly didn't take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already referred to as "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th attempt was done normally at first.
It was not until the end of the flight that technical damage occurred again.
Apparently, the engine went off in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the atomic submarine Dmitriy Donskij, which sailed below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from a vessel that is on the move and submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed broken "Bulava".
After all, from the first moment, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time, claiming that it is impossible to speak clearly of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted, and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although not a single test start has taken place completely flawlessly, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence leadership.
Thus, almost 50% of the success rate fills generals with optimism and still claims that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it can even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total mass of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will be again featured in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
Former World Champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup winner will help their CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably start in Friday's KHL duel against Saint Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formal arrangements, quoted by the AP coach of the Moscow club Sergei Nemčinov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only relate to one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, said German.
Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey player, according to the AP.
In the NHL, he played the entire season in 51 years for Hartford's legendary forward Gordie Howe and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the jersey of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven world champion titles, winning both the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected achievements in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in his Detroit jersey.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
The Hyundai's agreed to the union, canceling all overtime.
The management of the Hyundai Nošovice car factory agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
It was because of the often ordered overtime that the union declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai's spokesperson Petr Vaněk.
However, the management wants to agree with the unionists on one more Saturday innings this year.
We can't resign on our production plan, which is essential, which is why a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vaněk said.
Server Sedička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday's shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
People get that back on Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change the way employees were motivated for the proposed overtime.
They're either going to cash the overtime bonus or they're going to be free on December 28, and they're going to extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees get paid fares and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and pressing point in terms of unionists' comments and complaints, as well as the protesters' employees who stopped production vigorously last week, the management decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect yesterday afternoon, Vaněk said.
By last week, the employees of the car company were forced to work a two-hour overtime practically every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the union will call off the strike alert.
Further negotiations between the management of the car company and trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, union chief Petr Kuchar said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation in the car company escalated last week on Wednesday, when roughly 400 employees were on a spontaneous strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management opposed that overtime had to be made by employees to meet the requirements for delivery of cars.
In their Monday announcement of a strike alert, the trade union also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on employees who cut off production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, the union requires the firm to reduce overtime to a minimum.
Moreover, they want to pay a reward of CZK 5000 for it this year.
Nošovice automaker Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The company started the serial production last November.
By this September, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity being 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'solid' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity from drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on the conventional variant of the virus as some medicines already available.
AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
However, patients may have a significant life extension of a mixture of medicines that prevent the proliferation of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus proliferation results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the University of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metal carboranates act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way from all medicines used today and can therefore overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come up with new ‘improved' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metal carboranates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polywall cages formed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are linked by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and durable virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease due to HIV virus fission, mature infectious viral particles would not occur.
When we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is further systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease substances has been tested in the test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants derived from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metal-carborans on the conventional variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of the clinically used drugs, but does not lose its effect on resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modification makes metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
An argument over the budget. ODS embarked on Fischer, he resists.
The ODS chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget "terrifying" for next year, and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The ODS statement called the Prime Minister strong statements.
He says he's saving time for analysis.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the office cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to lean on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit or to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to public deficits is diametrically different, warned Nečas.
The House on Wednesday adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government’s opposition to the proposals of social democracy was that they secretly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, thus complying with the government's wishes that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget commission.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas believes that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment for the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering further remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
According to Nečas, the nominees of the ČSSD, who have implemented changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government if Fischer speaks out for another fight against the budget deficit.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other laws increasing the deficit, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment to the Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated for ODS were not guilty
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS nominees did nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in a text message from the US.
He recalled that at several ministries there are people in deputy posts applying to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the general government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
Then he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I did not think about it, and when this is up to date, I will address it, told journalists in the House Secretary of Defense Martin Barták, who was nominated for government by the citizens' Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council meeting this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS retreated
At the same time, time stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats did not explicitly ask for the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question as to whether the ODS was burdened by the absence of party chairmen in Parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice missing.
Ever since I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly the Bolshevikisation of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD order, fewer trains will go for almost the same fare
ČD will cancel or limit some of the less busy expressways and locals as of 13 December, while other connections will strengthen.
From the date of validity of the new timetable, the overall range of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
More possibilities of connection to the capital will be obtained by residents of Ostrava, for example, and the tracks will add one set of pendolinos to this line.
Rychlovlak, on the other hand, stops going to Bratislava.
Less speeds will also take place on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct links of Prague - Letohrad will be substantially limited.
From the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction of transport in the Hradec Králové Region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the line Praha - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today the Milovice must transfer to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovic.
The long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Hlavní nádraží.
ČD will introduce multiple connections SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jesenik will run at two-hour intervals.
Pendolin to Bratislava will no longer be taken by passengers from December 13.
Regional Railway Account this year: 200 million more
The express orders and payments are paid by the Ministry of Transport, the total to pay the so-called demonstrable losses will give the dears four billion crowns next year as well as this year. The locals order the regions, the total will pay eight billion crowns next year, with less than three billion regionals contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a newly concluded ten-year contract for locals and express trains, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, which is why they did not seem to raise the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Only one-day network tickets ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets will change.
For passengers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for a journey between any regional towns and was 160 crowns.
Philippine gunmen still holding over 50 people, children released
Today, in the south of the Philippines, gunmen kidnapped 75 people, including several elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which originally informed only 65 of the kidnapped.
All 17 incarcerated children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 militants are said to be using hostages as a living shield while fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now attempting to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police originally pursued the kidnappers due to the violence that required the handling of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was declared due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the election to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential House of Ampatuans, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (official title in Czech reads Invictus: Undefeated) is coming into the American cinemas, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, whom he claimed to have chosen Mandela for his portrayal years ago, took the role of world-renowned fighter against apartheid.
The side-by-side male role of legendary South African champion in rugby Francois Pienaar was hosted by Matt Damon.
With an introduction to the cinema, they arise from critics and the public's response
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the South African Mhuze.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, then in 1993 along with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations, however, are coming to the public at a time when preparations for the World Football Championships are both peaking in South Africa, but at the same time the media is rocking up disturbing reports of increasing racial hatred and discrimination against residents by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film in South Africa is generally positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the lead roles by the "flabby" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the new film in his words.
I've dreamed of this role for years, and I've prepared for it well.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to, as they say, draw his energy, in an interview after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can recall Mandel's personality and message with the film.
It is the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, added.
In the national rugby team jersey
A film based on a book draft by British writer John Carlin with a loosely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portraits the South African human rights advocate during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries during the film to bring together two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of the population and, as in 1995, Nelson Mandela, he also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby jersey on the world cup course that South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in the jersey, which is understood almost as something sacred in South Africa, Mandela harvested a large ovation of mostly white audience 14 years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reconnect people into one nation, reported rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve will yet prove itself.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a result of an example in a recent interview for LN, was revealed by a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
There's a transformer burning in Lounsk for tens of millions of crowns
The fire seized the transformer company Čeps in the substation near the village of Vyškov in Lounsk this morning.
In the fire, six units intervene, according to the spokesperson for the Ústí Region fire department, Lukáš Marvan.
Originally firefighters wanted the transformer burned out, but later they reconsidered the opinion and the fire extinguishes a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing substances.
The cause was a technical glitch, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured; according to Pavla Mandat's spokesperson, the crash does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it can be precisely calculated only after the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new transformer according to Mandate.
In the ten years of operation of Čeps, nothing similar happened, the defects of this type are rare, added.
According to ČEZ's spokesperson for northern Bohemia, Soni Holinger's Hendrychová power supplies were not interrupted, the operation of households, authorities and companies did not affect the fire of transformer stations.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, 400 kV electric lines and 220 kV electric lines.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a line route of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file a criminal report for defamation of three ČSSD captains
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura will file a criminal report today for defamation on three social-democratic captains.
Michal Hašek of the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek of the Pardubice Region and Governor of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesarík.
Jančura stated it in Twenty minutes of Radio Journal.
The action is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train transport in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with ČD.
All three captains are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, while we only brought an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true, because we know the Czech Railway Awards that were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation against Student Agency, told Radio Journal Jančur.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all counties that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing a stimulus for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of a criminal announcement to be another sequel to Mr Jančura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement by his companies and his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend the good name of my country and to challenge the other captains.
I suppose it will be clear on this occasion, too, that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public on regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jančura announced last week that he was investing several million crowns in advertising, which would warn the counties of a disadvantageous step.
He told Radio Journal that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year's.
He specified that the campaign would be waged against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with České dráhy and to order around CZK 150 billion did not announce tenders.
According to Jančura, similar action is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the regions, Jančura already threatened the MP for ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I know which master he is after, his name I won't say, he told Radio Journal Janchure today.
Inoculation against pneumococcals will be free and optional
Inoculations against pneumococcals will bring down experienced habits since January.
It is to be the first to be free and optional for families.
But there are voices now that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations to introduce free vaccination against pneumococcals peak.
The Institute of Medicine has already set maximum prices for vaccines paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clear on the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free Vaccines for August Children
As of January, children born last August 2 and later may be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they haven't received a single dose of vaccination.
Whoever started vaccination last year or earlier has to pay for the revaccination itself.
The first dose of vaccination must be administered between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
Last year, she volunteered to have her children vaccinated against pneumococcals by a quarter of the families.
My parents paid CZK 1600 for one dose or more.
Four doses are required for vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will issue CZK 300 to 450 000 per year on vaccination benefits.
However, it will save money for treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has given roughly $500,000 per year for all of the child vaccinations.
The enclosed vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot Package.
Pneumococococcal causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain membranes and blood poisoning.
For pneumococcal infections in our country in a year, up to 28 children under 10 will die according to an investigation in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced covered vaccinations against pneumococcals in about 40 countries.
Is vaccination mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are views that this vaccination could be compulsory in the future.
As of January, it is to be covered by insurance undertakings and optional.
For example, Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association, indicated that it would be better to be vaccinated.
Its pneumococcal vaccine association has been promoting the vaccine for a long time.
Experts at the international conference attended by our association were not entirely satisfied that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think that's the path we need to take now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the course of vaccination against pneumococcals.
At this point we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors
The President of the Professional Society of Practical Children's Physicians Hana Cabrnoch acknowledges that she has voluntary vaccination at her disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of revaccinations could be considered "In a situation where this vaccine costs so much, we understand fairly the political decision that the vaccination was launched as voluntary," Cabrnoch says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of fresh parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcals from next year.
Inoculation against pneumococcals is also a breakthrough in the fact that it is covered by health insurance, not by the state, as the first vaccination for children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save it on further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own stuff
But this is related to the concerns of practical children’s physicians who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intent, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some Members were afraid that insurance companies could "export money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the materials and wait for the insurance companies to pay them back.
According to estimates, individual practical child doctors will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'stealing in a museum'
The son of renowned American fantasist creator Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to rob paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
The appointed Mr. Frazetta and the second man used a digger to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, aged 81, became famous for creating Barbara Conana and Tarzan characters.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as reported by the Associated Press Press Press Press Press Agency.
The AP cited an unnamed police official who stated that Mr Frazetta Jr. could be motivated to act by long-standing family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger affidavit, aged 52, that he did so at the direction of his father, "to get to the museum in any possible way and to move the paintings into the sweetening space", as the Agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior denied the granting of any such permission, as the Agency said.
Labour defends the planned tax increase
The Ministries advocated the increase in taxes and spending cuts reported in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Tory have "squandered" the possibility of showing that they mean seriously delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
Even the Chancellor was under fire due to the disability of low and medium-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social security and 1% in public payments since 2011.
Distinguishment in respect of social insurance
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of approximately £3 trillion per year - which outraged the community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax while focusing on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, limiting to these incomes more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
PBR KEY POINTS
Social insurance will increase by another 0.5% as of April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase in 1% of the depreciation tax on small firms
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase in pension assessment by 2,5 %
According to the state financial administration estimate, some revenue of £30,000 will be reduced by £90 a year and some revenue of £40,000 will be reduced by £190, while some revenue of £10,000 will be increased by £110.
The ministers announced that their goal to halve the deficit by 2013 meant "complicated decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of those with the highest incomes.
Finance minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be a "duck in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"They are large numbers, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said that he believes that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But the drafting of a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In its opinion, he stated that the decline in the economy was 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5%, predicted in April - because the loans were £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A Missing Opportunity'
Conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, warning of the "crisis of indebtedness" of Labour, marked the planned £789 trillion loan over the next six years as intolerable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan as it could be paid for, adding, "cynically", they delayed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They did not add anything significant that could be done," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals, and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and to a greater extent.
But Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and reducing spending should be used to support spending next year rather than to reduce deficits, and argue that plans are "built on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson reported on the timing of the message - for example, the above-mentioned inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits in April next - that this could lead to accusations by the Chancellor in the election campaign if the money were difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation is revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although the ministers did not disclose the details of expenditure after 2011, economists stated that it was clear that reducing public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The recognized Institute of Budget Studies reported that Chancellor's figures indicate substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the budocno involving transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really very painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Revirro's Deloitte accounts.
"This was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget. Markets implement it."
FBI conducts investigations in 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a prison in Pakistan with five Americans, suspected of being linked to extremists.
Men were imprisoned for attacking a house in Sargoda in the province of East Punjab, as reported by the BBC U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI has informed that this is an investigation into whether these are the same men who have been declared missing in the last month in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are reported to be native to Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestry, and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and in what circumstances they stayed there," said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit reported that the Agency had been informed of the arrest and had been in contact with families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncles of one of them.
She stated that the house was always the center of interest of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States must "co-operate much more narrowly with Afghanistan and Pakistan in revealing a terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
The rejection of amnesty for Iranian abusers.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as the Amnesty International group's mission report states.
The report describes in detail "the methods of torture" in the pre- and post-controversial presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have called this criticism politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran, and dozens were killed following the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street dismantling since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were placed under arrest, and prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
A BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, now located in London, stated that previously in protests by the Supreme Leader Ayjatolah Ali Khomeini, he declared the illegality of some methods of torture and banned their implementation at Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of legal power have been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
Untrue confessions'
Amnesty International cited a report by 26-year-old computer science student Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he was accused of "work with the Facebook network" and for protesting the election results.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, reported Amnesty.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests after the election and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iran's senior civil servants denied the rape charges, but admitted the torture occurred.
Amnesty also reported a case of a former prisoner who stated that he was held in a container with other 75 persons for more than eight weeks in a Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and Justice had set up committees to investigate post-election unrest and government responses, but stated that the mandate and authority of the institutions were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees had been published.
The group stated that at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the memory of Bristol into a roller coaster for the race.
The downhill track for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowbordists to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill track in the Brandon Hill park was a short ski jumping bridge ahead of the 100 m long downhill track.
A fourth-year medical student, John Hickman, said it was a wonderful sight from the top of the downhill track, but that it was truly depressing.
It was a wonderful sight of the flashing lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowbordists from all over the country - some of them with real talents," he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best stunts - or maneuvers on the downhill track.
After Thursday evening's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minarets and general news of the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and considered whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrated - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French Don't Like Head Scarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study on issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the basics.
He spent months in mosques, schools, and institutes that are now taking care of 5 ‹ 6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproduces debates between teachers and students on issues that are most disturbing to them.
Should Muslim enter a marriage in a mosque or in a town hall (or in both places)?
Should Young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can Muslim marry a man who is not Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seem to be worldly issues that are being debated, and which are part of everyday life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other widely known persons, including Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen interviewed are inclined to believe that this is a counterpool of Selafi—the supporters of the Purists Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia— this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so fiercely advocates the lay public) are truly committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular Republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "tightening of value bolts".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may tend to say "Yes, but not now."
The World’s Wreckless Prospects
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
The bordering ice melts at alarming speeds, affecting animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers while waking them up.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and procedures of whaling describes the long tradition of polar explorers attempting to seize the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a courageous 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only with the collapsing musket is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their just killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, 75 polar bears performed in one circus tent.
Even today the enclosures in the zoo typically have a million times smaller area than the area available to adults in the wilderness. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America, and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis and all are armed with powerful assault rifles to blast their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfying responsibility to science for the Arctic and an engaging glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not everything scientists have answers to.
Not even meteorologists and oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
That's for lack of trials.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how the motion of floating ice occurs.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting divides as they underfloated them.
Satellite reconnaissance and extensive probe fields in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to the fearless individuals camping in winter.
Mr Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the downward system of Arctic ice, created by the drainage of salt water, which is shrinking during freezing.
But from the height of the given bear to microscopic miracles inside, all this is doomed once the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that could be us'
6000 Marine Corps members laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a plain wreath on a soldier's grave, with whom he had never met.
For him and the other Marine Corps members who made their way from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, this was the day in which they paid tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months' time, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me to show me respect as I do.
He was one of more than 6000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veteran cemetery in several departments during a memorial act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during a memorial act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this journey every year and stops in different cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America, which they also lay in other states.
In that year, volunteers placed over 16,000 wreaths in Arlington Cemetery, in Pentagon territory, on graves in Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park, New York City, and at a memorable location of flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has dedicated over $150,000 to purchasing and transporting wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, stated that she made her way to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt stated that it was her way to return what the victim was doing.
It is a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Enveloped in coats of warm cloth, volunteers passed through the cemetery on the surrounding grasses and hills.
Volunteers headed to the older graves of World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and together held hands while delivering the young pine to the grey gravestones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch pčes the upper part.
Near Section 60, where most veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there is indeed silence.
The associated service organizations dedicated 1000 wreaths to decorating the department, but the gloomy mood of the waning wars was just fulfilling the area.
Some sincerely wept, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud names, engraved in stones, while others bowed down to view small black and white nametags, pushed into wet mud where headstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped their tears from their eyes in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the final resting place of Sergeant of the Navy Artillery David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor trapped by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as officials of the State Department stated on Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the American interest section in Havana sought access to a detainee who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is called "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to take the prizes, but she has been denied the permit.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of increasing tensions between Communist Castro's brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been pursued as a "delaying tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They first filed a report on the New York Times' imprisonment on Friday night.
The new American policy stressed that when the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the associated states will take reciprocal action.
Cell phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average wage of a public employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The capture of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for misdemeanors such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, press officer of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free cell phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Group's program, which recently published an adverse report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader and replacement for the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that all solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are moving towards a more extensive dialogue.
Pakistan's civil servants are plotting to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistan authorities discovered on Saturday the alleged leader of a plot involving sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, stating that they hope that this case could help to uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits who are snooping around the Internet looking for radicalized young men.
Investigators reported that they were searching for a gray insurgent personality, known as Saifulllah, who invited these men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of these men posted a comment, approving the terrorist attacks having an internet video site YouTube.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote Pakistan area in the Pakistan Native Tribe Zone of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence officer who reported on the case stated on Saturday that Saifulllah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for a few days in the eastern district of Sarghody, away from the horrendous mountains in the northwest, which became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
An official who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case stated why they were dropped out.
The official stated that the men were not intimidated and were still trying to gain approval to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested exercising Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is credible.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has assigned top priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, disfellowshipping those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. false recruits were subjected to a special investigation in al-Qaeda, reported by analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because due to their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the US, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years, allowing Koh to approach them because American intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been so monitored? Mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets this Saturday, demanding more vigorous action on climate from negotiators at the city's Bello Congress Center.
Protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but police are making the number less than 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day when a minor incident occurred in climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists went through the city and carried banners with English inscriptions "This is not planet B" (i.e. second-rate) and one in Spanish that reported "Country says 'Enough'."
Several celebrities participated in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who stated that she had traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the dreary state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still taking place.
That's part of the reason we decided to join this great march -- walk the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching downtown Bello and stated that she had detained 19 people, primarily because they either had masks on or had pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate horners, activists masked as athletes and in black suits laid several charges near Copenhagen's main channel, located near several ministries.
They agitated in buildings, stated, started flares, but then followed by "a few major explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether yet the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is indeed something I do not realize).
Then he went on to Chinese and said, "Because the venue is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
The focus of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change is seen, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data revealed constant persistent racial differences
The federal certificate from last week on the knowledge gained from mathematics was a welcome element of good news regarding the Columbia district's public education.
Although the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate showed greater advances in pupils of fourth and eighth classes over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Testing Centre for the Advancement in Teaching are the persistent differences in knowledge gained between African-Americans and white students, both local and national.
The average result of white pupils of the fourth class of Columbia district over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from possible 500), but their African-American peers have only grown by three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in knowledge achieved has increased from 53 points to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress in African-Americans in eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a shift of statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results as the sample size was not large enough.
A picture over a six-year period is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils of the fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAP was performed in the district, was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from oboi groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly close to 58.
Some of the district's education advocates said that the results, hailed by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were more extensively stimulated by white students where the results were already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of working in the precinct.
I don't jump up and down due to a scattering of two or three points, said a D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Mrs Rhee's style of administration, Mrs Brown said that reporting on the test results means secondary education in the city is in desperate condition and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the positives, and I respect that.
But what is horrifying is that we did not devote almost any of the time and energy that needed to be devoted to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said that the precinct's efforts are to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-result students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in using a new curriculum read, Wilson's system of reading, aimed at students of higher elementary school classes and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their wheeled careers lag significantly behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and curriculum of teaching mathematics to the sixth grade, emphasizing the games and experiences of real life, which reached the precinct behind former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NEEP, which was reported last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and do the best possible interventions for those under-class students, Mrs Rhee said.
Others have stated that the NAP results have clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is Mrs Michell Rhee's particular dilemma, said Bruce Fuller, professor of teaching at the University of California at Berkeley where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional adjustment procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, focus can bring political reverberations that are directed against an important agenda.
But the blame belongs to other city directors who are trying to keep the median average between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must establish the kinship of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be confident that their children will be given excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the school director in Newark, stated in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to ensure the legitimacy of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who made a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he sees as "a symptom" to look for a bigger increase in the next year.
Making Higher Education Part of a Better Future
The commuter bus entered Gettysburg College with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, ascended and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green grassers..
Gracielini's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the ground of the college.
Now she and other eighth-class students in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition fees were $38690 a year, their position was rather than intimidated visitors excited by potential students.
Yes! That's it! Gracela exclaimed, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? She said in a thoughtful way when they revealed a low profile of professors to students.
Pennsylvania College was one of the seven who visited on their three-day trip and were now completely interested in the future news: the question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is from where.
However, this is a serious problem regarding the high number of children born in the U.S. of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from colleges or who become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one fifth of this "dwelling generation" of Spanish college pupils - the remarkable results achieved indicate that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans, and residents of Central America, made it to the United States without graduating from college.
Their success story is important, reported by researchers, as it underlines their point of journey forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the field of the country's labor force.
Those who achieved higher education say they had a natural inclination to school and inherent perseverance and efforts to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children, seeking ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to attend college - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we consider that children come from low-income groups whose parents lack experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve it, says Patricia Gandhi, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American area.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school network in every way they can go through college.
The federal program, which funded Graciela's rail trip, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (advanced), it provides over $300 million per year for local school systems to run college prep programs that start for students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, this program has served over 10 million students, more than % of whom entered colleges, according to U.S. Department of Education data.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fear of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to induce significant oil companies to reconstruct its infirm infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements were concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
Only one has submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached agreements on a field that was auctioned in June.
The meager participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of American companies you have here first and foremost on the way of Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online newscaster.
That'll be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as withdrawing the U.S. military are likely to deter American companies from a much more intense business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third largest raw material reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, US firms were at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other governments controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to make deals with the ministry.
Leading American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in previous years, left empty handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic, as well as a technological force, said the Minister of Petroleum Industry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We believe that China's company will be comparable to competition and will live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that have been provisionally selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price for the barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current levels in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
On the impact of an American missile near the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, a top al-Qaeda operations planner was apparently killed, as announced on Friday by U.S. counterterrorism officials.
As confirmed, this could be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car in Thursdays near the town of Miran Śah in the province of Sevverní Vaziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have determined that the missiles were launched from an unmanned aircraft type with which the CIA operates in a zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were directed to a white car that was headed toward the Afghan border when it was hit, reported by an official along with the Pakistani Cicilian intelligence agency who telephoned from Miran Shah.
The official stated that local gunmen rushed to the point and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. officials of the counterterrorism department cited an unspecified witness who stated that Somali was after death.
Somali was listed as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner who directed operations by terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan and Pakistan areas.
He was involved in enthralling around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be appointed, who featured the sensitive nature of American air strikes in Pakistan territory.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was given instructions from Al-Qaeda's senior leadership, and based on them he planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somali quickly progressed in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person for some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second senior leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban to be killed from September when in a similar attack he was killed by Najmetin Jalolov, a militant faction leader in the Native Tribes zone and three other top poperative leaders.
The pace of attacks, initiated by the CIA using unmanned aircraft, has declined since summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to Long War daily records, a website, managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have reason to improve the tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing persons suspected to be informants, listed the site.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul resigned.
A top United Nations delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would want to withdraw from his post in March, ending a turbulent term that was thwarted by allegations of widespread corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure occurs because the Obama administration has decided to send more 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation stated that it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US's schedule for reducing the status that starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the building of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment taken must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008, that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now stated that he would need time to find a replacement.
Like I said, it's high time to look for a follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun a search for replacements.
Officials have stated that it is decided between Staffan di Mistura, who has Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who had previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election from masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but stated that the allegations of Galgraith -- who was released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international interference" in the election.
Eide stated that he had proposed a meeting with the highest representative of citizens to coordinate the mitigation of US leadership efforts in Afghanistan.
He also directed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to borrow them for the Afghan mission, so, as he says, he would want to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of his efforts in Afghanistan, stating that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermine her ability to exploit her abilities.
The rules of the UN are that I had the opportunity to acquire only one person from May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers would soon impose "other major sanctions" on Iran due to lack of commitment in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week's journey across areas where there is war in Afghanistan and Iraq, has bascatelized the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
That's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about likely developments. "
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is inherent unpredictable in war.
The Obama administration decides on a package of sanctions that could hit the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and inhibitions" would require "to make the Iranian government truly feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its inhabitants will suffer extremely" by sanctions.
According to a Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved European leaders in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its Supervisory Body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks about limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his uranium-enriched reserves in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But ever since then, Iran seems to withdraw from interim agreements - partly because of this, states an expert, because the Irama leadership is divided into opinions about whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, with regard to Iran's stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a journey that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to search for other elections including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degraded sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York City, the Iranian mission to the UN condemned on Thursday what it called "unwarranted and unfounded accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities, stating that it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met the Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the Kurdistan area, oil-rich to meet the troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions persist between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to prevent delays in US plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen Kurdish concerns about persistent depression. U.S. official sites cited Gates when he told Massoud Barzaani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they learned that when official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth rates and aging populations in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We saved nothing for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years of China's policy to have only one child was introduced and thus created two generations only notoriously chubby and spoiled children, affectively dubbed "little emperors", the country threatens the population crisis.
The average birth rate declined to 1.8 per couple compared to six before politics entered into force, according to United Nations data.
The population distribution, where the population at the age of 60 and above is predicted to rise sharply from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the total average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is larger rich coastal cities with a population of college education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above accounted for almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning said, many couples must have children to "help reduce proportions of an ageing population and reduce the number of labour in the future".
He says it's about being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.
Gradual calming
As was inserted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate established during the Communist Party's rule.
The couples who violated politics faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official sites advocated a policy that helped the country prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion in the second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexist selection abortions, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, population officials have gradually been milder in their opinion on the politics of one child.
In 2004, they generally allowed exemptions - including urban residents, members of national minorities, and cases where male and female were only children - and in 2007 they eased the diction of their slogans, promoting a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the University of Beijing Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became China's first city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters, urging parents to have only one child, were replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, reported by family planning officials.
Grieving Response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples wishing to have a second child after the campaign began, most of the city districts have not reported changes.
The Huinan City District with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee in Shanghai's Caola quarter, stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and have been legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without the official interception net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the west misjudge one child's politics as a question of law, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in a union with the first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples state psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resources administrator, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of our families' attention and we were all cared for.
We were not used to provide care, and we did not really want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who was the own translation company, expressed this much more indiscriminately.
For two-carrier middle-class parents who reduced birth rates, he said, to be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds view parents as fighting through the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalistism and do not want this method of nourishment for themselves, he says.
It's one child who puts enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the questionable questions of the propstor -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and strategies -- "You have to have résumés ready at a time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group outlined a plan for reducing emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching indiscriminate attitudes and mutual scolding -- again on Friday, focused on releasing a document that proposes an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide a way out for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But important progress was seen in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with over 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc Working Group, this text quietly states how much money rich countries should provide to those poor to deal with global warming both in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to limit their carbon output, and what should be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that political officials will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, Chief Representative of the Sierra Washington Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed a six-page document, crumpled from 180 pages of text from negotiations to focus on what a top climate officer at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It outlines outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by the year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the country would cut emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union has discussed quickly on Friday the promise that it will provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poorer countries accept climate change adaptation -- ranging from flood management and drought management to preventing deforestation.
Still, Friday stated the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in talks last week.
U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected the speech, demanding a binding reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to volunteering for major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line against China to run by Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not enough to secure restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after China's Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the U.S. Chief Negotiator about climate issues that either the lack of "salary reason" or "exceptional irresponsibility" had led to the announcement earlier this week that the United States would not help financially China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of major world powers at stake, tensions erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the two ten most influential countries in the world ignore the scientific imperative for carrying out more vigorous actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of greenhouse gas reduction, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large issuers from being responsible in their actions.
It is clearly a game about the new economic hegemony developing, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional advisor in the field of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation of nature.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable influences of climate change have indicated that they would want to continue to enforce a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants have said that the best outcome of the talks will be a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that the promotion by small island nations "invokes political chatter for the entire political process" in part because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations sparked a new urgency once the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the Heads of Government competed for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as the Indian Minister of Environment Jairam Rameš and the Chinese Deputy Minister stepped out of the aircraft and ran through the Bella Centre Halls to close the doors of meetings and new conferences so they could set out claims to be assessed next week.
The total extent of the assembly - when 13000 people moved from and to the convention centre every day, to guitars played by activists staged at night an ironic spectacle of countries they believed had sent them, and they passed hand-to-hand designs to hand on paper rather than by electronic mail -- controlled by a challenge.
Intensity is only superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier at the center of 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for Global Policy at International Conservation of Nature.
Heavy scales are coming.
The British first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour redefined this Monday's feelings
At 5:13 on Monday morning, the whistle cut through darkness to mark the departure of the train, which marked the revolution of traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and flies from Ashford, Kent to London's St Pancras and crosses a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transportation, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed passenger kit outside of Indyn.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of Midland, North and Scotland to London.
Missed standing water should reduce traffic times in passenger transport and on business routes and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
Theoretically, the three major political parties were acquired for this vision.
But dozens of pounds, necessary to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now slowed down the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a viable study to the government, passed on its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as reported by the Times.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of another planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route of London's connection with West Midland was designed to five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where it could reach the living environment could be problematic.
In the open landscape, a final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also assumes to determine three choices for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is the Y-shaped configuration, when one high-speed track should lead to western Midland.
The line should share near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like there's been the most powerful choice," said the railroad expert.
As soon as this is done, the driving times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should allow trains to travel at 2250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to hijack 400 m trains that would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
Given the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to include a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not take place before the general election.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but already existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain the travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a decisive point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, an indicative point for the revolution on the railway.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of £75,000 on the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, holder of the Tory's leading seat bench in the House of Commons, paid the taxpayers £1,000 last year for the orangery he built in his home in the constituency.
The party's spokesperson for prisons, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "from rations", raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-covered extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, totaling hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims on time, so he was not interrogated by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the checks on members of the expenditures. Last night, Mr Duncan expressed his demands "it could have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Financial Authority has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the house a winter garden, which is marked in the plans as "orangery".
Neighbors describe her as a "glass for entertainment and entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide some explanation for an increased loan during the last check by the Municipal Standards and Privileges Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pubilary security to a mortgage of £271406 from his London estate to a house in his constituency, which he purchased in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Deputies.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to over £1,800 per month.
The interest of Mr Duncan's RBS mortgage payments could not change at this time, indicating that all of this was intended to finance a loan of £75,000.
The standard RBS variable mortgage payment declined from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, while remaining.
The last document by the municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim £1250 per month this May.
Mr Duncan left his job as the shadow leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said that MPs must survive "on ration" after the spending scandal.
"In principle, it's nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like [Bleep]."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as a oil merchant, was first invited to explain his editions in May when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the Financial Authority, that it "may be considered excessive".
One activist dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the Financial Authority and subsequently Legg."
He added: "This is not a disputed question of concealing and misrepresenting or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's a perfectly straight line down, by the rules, justified, and that's it.
This could not be done by many other ways cleaner or easier".
Come and have a close look at the cabin on the Brighton coast with the Advent Calendar.
Coast cottages in Brighton found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the ducional enjoyment of creativity called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day of December, and to use Christmas colts as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were allowed to see the last cottage from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and bishop's bread and welded wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the cottage featured the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, assistant in television marketing from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a wake-up manner.
"Idea of Advent calendar in chats originated just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went out to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a Copenhagen conference, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN Climate Conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish climate conference president, stated that the growing global mobilization, whose clear evidence is the current manifestation, would have contributed to the "political tax" of the eventual failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the procession began, when a group of about 300 protesters dressed in black began breaking windows with paving blocks and hammers.
The police immediately intervened forcefully.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the event organizers, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals "without distinction" were arrested and stressed that about a hundred were in handcuffs and sitting "holding in the streets still on Saturday night" despite extreme winters.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate it.
A stage was built for the speakers before which a spiritual candlelight meeting took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters came by bus and train from large European cities, and in addition to Africans there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first rally in Copenhagen in the morning, on the challenge of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today we go to the streets to demand an environmental debt settlement in favour of the South, explained by Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: for that it is time, the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo claimed.
In Africa, rivers and streams dry, today we can walk in them, and that was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 by the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of fighting for another world approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the characters fighting for another world, said he had arrived in Copenhagen in order to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people went out into the streets.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and with scarves evocative of the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundreds of protesters went out on the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east) participated in protests organized by the "350" movement.
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected her president, Georgia condemns it as a "storage"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, approximately a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian Separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this move to be a "storage".
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Election rooms closed at 17 hours GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazi Electoral Commission, attendance was 58% a few hours before the election rooms closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "repents that Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory with 216.000 inhabitants only recognised Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the separation from Georgia, after the conflict in 1992-1993, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the newspaper AFP Kvarčija Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to vote in the election room at the school in the capital Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main issue of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea shore, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Huge billboards with Bagapš alongside Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin are deployed throughout this small country with 216.000 residents.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful course of the election received warm reception from the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, Abkhaz, are grateful" he said in a small ceremony, having in mind Moscow's support and, in particular, her decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, and toasted it with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for a period of 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
To win the election, it takes an absolute majority of 50% plus one vote.
If none of the candidates achieve this result, a decisive match must be held within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went out to the streets on Saturday, demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a Copenhagen conference, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers manifested in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, acting on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate it.
A stage was built for the speakers before which a spiritual candlelight meeting took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents shortly after the procession's departure, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed all in black and armed bricks and hammers, began breaking windows.
The police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several manifestos to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultraradical separate groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one police officer was injured by a paving block on his jaw and four cars near a squat located near incidents were torched, resulting from police sources arresting about 20 people.
We focus on extremist groups, warned police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the police helicopters flew again into the air.
Most protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first rally in Copenhagen in the morning on the challenge of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".

French MEP José Bová, one of the characters fighting for another world, said he had arrived in Copenhagen in order to "connect climate and social justice". "There is currently no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
Oxfam called on several well-known personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people went out into the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people manifested in front of the City Hall of the Philippines, mostly students in red clothing and with scarves evocative of the importance of solar energy.
Several hundred protesters also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta with the demand for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east) participated in protests organized by the "350" movement.
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Geography and history subjects will be strengthened as part of the general grammar school reform, Chatel stated.
Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during an interview for JDD magazine that history and geography subjects will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of general grammar schools, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of grammar school with a focus on exact science.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and for all there will be the same program from general culture, confirmed by Chatel.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end with hypocrisy", because according to him, S's specialty is no longer focused on exact science but "essentially, there are the best students in it".
The EC and L specializations cannot be for some kind of sub-specializations, continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals complaining that geography and history are not taught in the last year of vocational grammar schools".
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by Humanité, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography teaching in the graduation year with specialization S, so many intellectuals and teachers also criticized the cancellation, both left and some right-wing Members.
On the contrary, the minister added that "not an option" to abolish philosophy in the S graduation program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they believe will sacrifice the pedagogical education of future grammar schools professors.
As part of Master's degree 2 (M2) he will take an entrance examination focused on their field at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an additional examination verifying their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will attend professional internships during their second year of master's studies and will perform as a professor-intern before pupils for the first year.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite university of École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is a challenge announced in Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, the multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) at the initiative of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As reported by one AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of fifteen minutes' contributions from experts to be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them more eager to learn something more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after a fish from a local pond, which was named by students.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk for hours, but we can also sum up basic targets in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of 50 listeners without pre-arranged notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he emphasized with the hope that listeners will know that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Videos filmed at these lectures will be placed on the school's website from 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
Prison overseers' unions announced "general mobilisation" on Friday, demanding that they be reimbursed by Christmas holidays for bonuses and overtime, whose remuneration was postponed for financial reasons until January.
The prison FO (2nd supervisory union) asked employees who would not be on duty to attend a demonstration taking place on Tuesday morning outside prison facilities to "block them" to point out "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison overseers (3rd union of this sector) urged them to " convene meetings in individual prisons and start a major mobilization" with the fact that it is "disgraceful and unacceptable" that "overtimes and extras for work at night, Sundays and holidays" worked in October are not paid in December.
The First Union of Supervisors, Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for overall mobilization (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and outrage".
The Administrative Directorate and Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased a lot in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The office said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison overseers' union to assure them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts the prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister in his communication.
I ordered the administrative directorate of the prisons to take immediate action so that the situation, which arose by misevaluating the number of overtimes, would never repeat in the future, was added by Minister Alliot-Mari.
Thus, the December wage will be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous bonuses for performing their functions and achieving their goals, states Ufap/Unsa, and for those "there is always room in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional union of the FO in Marseille has become indignant and announced its decision to boycott 'all meetings and subpoenas' until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, unless they are reimbursed for these days of October in December, as well as for overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without giving us additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest employees to pay for it, states the CGT-prisoners in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case the funds are few, said Secretary-General Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" for Christmas than the ones he gets
American President Barack Obama, preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to Oprah Winfrey's "god" screen that as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I receive".
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast Sunday night at ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a little four-legged family companion, gets his piece.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog also "of course" gets a gift, as follows from the snippets from the preliminary broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also opposed her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts she receives, "No, I certainly didn't, I gave you a great gift last year", teasing the president.
Well, of course that's true, he was forced to agree with the President, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed a finger at the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who gave you this?".
In this one-hour very relaxed show with the famous presenter, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obama couple also talked about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with a ten-degree gearbox, but also a basketball given to him by his Kenyan father at Christmas, with whom he met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father come to see us for Christmas and he gave me that basketball, the president told me.
It wasn't until long after I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I evened all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, remembering Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL reports he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to "injury" arising from a larger operation he had experienced in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the station RTL stated that the singer is in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors stated the "injury resulting from the operation" of the ejected fence he had suffered in Paris on November 26, telling his press department in Paris, with these lesions requiring a "repair operation".
However, the singer's press department tried to reassure the public and stated that the situation was "under control" while announcing that a new medical communiqué would be released within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was inducted into artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more sure, he's adding RTL.
Press department, at the request of AFP did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no drone was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for an ejected fence.
The surgery, which had been planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a physician well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL information.
After this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said on RTL radio Thursday that his boyfriend was going through a "wrong period", but added that he was "not worried about the rocker" because he was a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid things because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation was no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
Wednesday night calmed down the situation of singer producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who stated that Johnny Hallyday "responsives well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The health problems of the singer have only been multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his bachelor party.
But since then, each of his health problems has been very monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to dement the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small swimming pool: premiere of Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large swimming pool won a title at the 2009 European Championship in a small swimming pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, at which jumpsuits are last allowed, only three world records fell, although many more were expected.
One of them surpassed Hungarian racewoman Evelyn Verraszt for a 200 m position race and two remaining men's relay of Russia for a 4x50 m position race.
A great grief for Bousquet, who had set an eye on the world record for the 50 m free way, of which he is already a holder in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, the 50m free way, a 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, on which ten swimmers first started instead of the ordinary eight.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20,70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20,84), but failed to beat the world record (20.30), as he assumed.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore overalls made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The combinations helped from February 2008 to 238 world records, and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 at the same competition.
This time, the use of the suit did not help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in the big pool in Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to beat the record held at 400 metres in the free way (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian driver Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't give everything I had in that race.
I knew I couldn't beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival for the future, explained by Biedermann.
USA: a record of Romanesque sarcophagus belonging to Zolo was auctioned for US$1.5 million
The record of the Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to no one but French writer Emil Zolo, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than estimated, said the art dealer Sotheby's.
The price of this two metres long and 63 cm tall front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Marble "presenting four dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants is a rare work, similar pieces are very few in the world, perhaps four or five," said AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art near Sotheby's.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is an object that was probably the most awarded, told the AFP spokesman Sotheby ́s, Dan Abernethy.
Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble was found a few days ago.
The board was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borgia family collection and then gradually appeared with French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bath in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before joining the power of Marshal Petain.
It remained overshadowed there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered while searching the museum database in the Louvre that this plaque was part of "the remains of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of author "Therese Raquin" and fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted attempt at President Zelaya's departure from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure.
After the phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far suggests that there is no way to make this transfer, the Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinos, said.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya, flew back again, reported the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Pučist government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demisi" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with a safe exit.
But the overthrown president rejected these demands because he wanted to leave for Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The Puchi government "experienced another failure when she wanted me to give up my post (...), they wanted me to resign", said Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which she has often commented on the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, he added a overthrown president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said the Minister of Interior of the Pučist Government, Oscar Raul Matute to Honduran Radio HRN, on Wednesday.
I will not apply for asylum to any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for Telesur station, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the overthrown president, who came to gather around the Embassy of Brazil, where the military strengthened protection.
Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the attitude of the Puchi government.
They thus show their marginal attitude towards international standards, added.
Zelaya, who approached Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, Army, and Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of here, he'll be arrested, and he'll be responsible for the crime of treason, which he's accused of, claims the Pucist government.
Pupil President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize the presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections, recognized by the United States, but condemned by Latin American countries as Venezuela, Argentina, or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance urges optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended with an increase on Thursday, and US trade balance results show an increase in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones earned 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final deadline, Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102,35 points.
We have good news coming from various parts of the economy, commented on Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focusing on "half full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on U.S. trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade balance deficit dropped by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected an increase in deficits.
Both imports and exports have increased.
A major innovation is the growing volume of trade, particularly exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the major United States trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, unemployment grew against all expectations in the United States last week, and the number of jobseekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants has fallen "to the lowest of this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The proceeds of the Treasury with a 10-year view increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the yield to 30 years rose to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of supporters of the regime booed "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed at Thursday by the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented further manifestations for which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in White", wives or close political prisoners were booed directly on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime in their march towards the capital center with a request for the release of political prisoners, informing the journalist.
Down with the Yankees!, "The Mercenaries!", "The streets belong to revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted with raised fist supporters of the regime to dissidents.
Dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who arrived "to ensure security".
The day before, there was a similar manifestation in Havana against "Ladies in White", but it did not cause injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, about ten dissidents, who were also about to manifest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, were detained by AFP journalist.
According to this journalist, police loaded dissidents who were booed by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions lasts only a few hours from the rule.
The winners of the 2005 Sakharov European Parliament Award "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for "exempting all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their archenemy, the United States.
A miracle, Cuban television has brought news of Thursday's manifestation of supporters of the government regime against the "responsives of the revolution".
Cuba, with the Communist Party leading and one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A lunatic with a knife killed an 80-year-old man and wounded 5 people in Clichy-la-Garene.
A lunatic armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five other people in Clichy-la-Garene (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak time on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the assailant at the age of 28 reportedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in or before the pharmacy, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of police and witnesses.
Severely wounded old man, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance Police Syndicate in the hospital due to injuries.
In this pharmacy or in front of it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband in his early 30 ’ s began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the other injured is in danger, according to police sources apparently the vital organs were affected.
A pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," said a police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as reported by a police source, then fled into the street, still on the boulevard of Jean Jourès.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, because everything happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried cross behind his back, said at the site of the Alliance syndicate's head in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-bys, including young people, have attempted to stop and disarm the lunatics, according to the AFP's testimony.
I saw about a 30-year-old man in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation of Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd threw him, including one city police officer, who broke his wrist in the process, added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to apprehend an armed man and were injured by fists, stating a police source.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garene, where many shops are located.
The passers-by came to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a large abdominal wound, told AFP Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second, about 30 - year - old person, who also had stab wounds with a knife, came along.
A man who didn't have identity papers was subsequently arrested by the state police.
The Attorney General in Nanterre handed the case over to the Hauts-de-Seine District Police Investigation Department (SDPJ 92).
The suspect assailant was taken to the hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody, awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out his location in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said that six police officers were needed to handle him at Clichy Police Station, where he was taken.
He was "totally out of himself" as "all lunatics of this type, whose power in action increases ten times ".
U.S.A.: Polanski's lawyer requisitions for termination of prosecution
Polish-French director Roman Polanski's lawyer re-appealed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the film's director "Pianist", criticized serious mistrials in front of three judges of the second district's appeal court in California during the trial at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and now, said Hummel lawyer and added that of the conduct of the judge who was then deciding, Laurence Rittenbanda "had a chill in his back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was reported to have acted with the state's attorney before the verdict was pronounced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and requested), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually stated at the end of September that he "lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will demand a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claims.
The prosecutor repeated what had already been said at the first state, namely that there would be no serious study of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski came to trial.
A 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court handed down a judgment in the matter of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a minor girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never re-entered the territory of the United States.
Deputy Prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to take part in the trial".
In this case, we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? Mrs. Asayam asks.
It is of the opinion that the director "asks the court for kindness while at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take the decision also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel's lawyer was not the only one asking to stop Roman Polanski's prosecution.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also applied again to end the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the constant harassment every time the Polanski case emerged and added, "No one in this room can say that the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland at U.S. order
After more than two months behind bars, he was put under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is waiting for a possible expulsion.
Wall Street ends without direction, stopped by a rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended in no direction on Friday, the market flutters among indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising dollar price: Dow Jones earned +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to figures from the final deadline, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance he left 0.55 points and finished at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, reported by Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in close range, the volume of trade has declined greatly, and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by publishing economic indicators that are better than expected, and which "helped to improve the mood in the market in terms of stability of economic recovery," summarized analysis by Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales rose 1.3% in November, and for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the confidence of American consumers has also returned, and in December it rose strongly to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices have been hampered by a new increase in the dollar price against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses downward sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are losing ground.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield of state treasures with a 10-year view rose to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a 30-year view increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% a day earlier.
Miss World election again in South Africa.
After a month's travel across South Africa, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are going to cross the finish line to achieve their dream: be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration has been held in the Johannesburg area for the second year and so far five candidates have gained advance to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariata Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real vortex of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!, she confided in Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which has been held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in north Johannesburg, since 17:00 (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country to put a crown on.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy to have been able to experience it twice, confided in Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "land that blows her breath away".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participated in the election by Aishwarye Rai, the 1994 winners who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the envoy of our countries, and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to organizers, the 59th year will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will present themselves in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will feature Chinese television host Angela Chow, former South African Beauty Queen Michelle McLean, and Chairman of Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome a world of warmth that is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
The candidates participated in the safari last year, visiting the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
For the president unusual, she noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event slightly more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I'll definitely go back to the 2010 World Cup, says with enthusiasm Miss Italy Alice Tatacchi.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us on Friday's arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, stated David Hallyday while performing from the plane, which arrived from Paris just after 13th hour of local time (21st hour of world time)
The singer's son, who worked calmly, stated that "as quickly as possible" he would arrive at the Los Angeles Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, to which Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to post-operative infection resulting from an operation of ejected intervertebral fences, which he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press statement, the singer was this night in Los Angeles due to the comfort of "put into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles already inducted into artificial sleep. Hospitalization occurred due to an infection following an operation ejected by an intervertebral fence carried out on November 26 in Paris.
Due to serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be re-operated at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer's information, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of the French lyceo in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The priority of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that it was leaving for the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer blamed Dr Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons stated that they were outraged, reported M. Camus.
I've heard of the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday" left too quickly for Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon".
I personally spoke on the phone with the doctor, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had suffered from intervertebral fences twice, he added.
Shortly before the radio station RTL reported that the singer apparently left after Paris surgery without a drone, without anything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in the removal of a hematoma resulting from a cerebral hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
The attorney of the Olivier Metzner Medical Chamber referred to him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned before the Medical Chamber, and who cannot even be "defariously recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux commented on the matter on Friday through his attorney David Koubbi.
He reported that the procedure had "completely good progress" and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, therefore the introduction of the drainage was not necessary", he added.
The health problems of the singer have grown since this summer, and in any case his next tour seems to remain with the question mark.
Clearly, the deadline for the renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiens, note red.) appears too close, Camus stated.
The UDF Association raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to continue to use their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by the MoDemFrançois Bayrou side, responded on Friday to the attempt by the party president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervého Morin to appropriate the abbreviation of the former Giscard party, with the fact that the abbreviation must not be used in any medium under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to appropriate abbreviate the UDF with the fact that François Bayrou did not deserve to bear her inheritance after he handed his hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre movement (NC).
This move received support from the Member of the Hervé de Charetto (former for-UMP now behind NC) who credited the ownership of the UDF brand because he first had it registered at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprété industrialelle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, the Committee of the UDF, governed by François Bayrou's friends, who do not intend to be expropriated, stepped out of his silence and made a formal request to both the minister and the MPs to stop using the acronym and handing back the trademark's ownership, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the alarming statements about proposing to your political movement +receive abbreviated by UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centre.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your promotional material and on your movement's welcome website, with the slogan +UDF today+, also the letter signatories.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC movement" immediately to remove all mentions of the name UDF from all promotional materials including (its) websites".
At the same time, he asks Hervého de Charette "to hand ownership of the mark over to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will contact the courts to respect the law and legitimate rights of members of the UDF, warning the signatories.
In his letter, they state that UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 "and recall that Mr Morin and his friends have "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002 to establish an UMP.
The movement of Nouveau centre therefore, according to them, has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoD for three years and to form a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervého de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", was no longer "a member of UDF for three years", but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used non-existent acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion begins to be transformed into a crime, they claim, and then, with irony, they express themselves to the NC strategy: "We feel that in both politics and ordinary life, it is more valuable to create a name for itself than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name to which we have no right".
Liliane Bettencourt's case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to give a verdict as to whether he took advantage of the state of weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, of which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames him.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of the famous, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, an offence for which a penalty of EUR 375 000 is imposed for a maximum duration of 3 years.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a process in the case, which can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mothers and daughters attack each other and struggle to manage the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by a college of three physicians.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such an examination, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Attorney General in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 while expressing whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and in which period.
I think he's going to go through with it.
I'll talk to her about the matter. After the hearing, Ms. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman, stated.
As far as François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was concerned, he welcomed the court's decision.
It is excellent news(...). Expertise will show that he has manipulated this old lady who needs protection (M. Banier).
It's been two years since the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-artist who has accused him of using her mother's weakness for years to obtain a donation of a billion euros in checks, life insurance contracts, or master paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's court-law of lawyers changed at times into the family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's attorney submitted three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, expressing her distrust of Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt adds, according to the lawyer, "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise".
The Attorney General in Nanterre again found that the actions of the complainant were not justified, even more so that the custody judge had rejected her application to initiate legal protection proceedings for her mother in those days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely capable of taking part in the trial, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her", confirmed prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court ruled that Ms Bettencourt-Meyers' rightfulness would be expressed at the time the trial was initiated.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was in vain...
For more than a decade, the behavior of management of large companies has reminded employees of the approach of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about co-workers identifying with the "values" determined from the mountain, as was the case before, when consumers had to be forced into products that came from the ideas of factory technicians.
By becoming the centre of business companies, the marketing revolution has compared the market conquest strategy in the right direction...although authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, return regularly!
A passive approach by employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that mainly affects managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI "requires an active approach and predictability from all stakeholders (...) and requires commitments from employees that are completely contrary to the income of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a management revolution, which should aim to bring workers to the centre of interest of the company as well as a client.
Relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire presented to Orange employees - will contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I've already convinced myself that, in the face of a new situation, the structure will return preferably to what it has always done after various turns!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionally with the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Since they're college graduates for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of mental comfort, they embrace the old behavioral theory, currently revived by "neurosciences" from the US and widely distributed without much knowledge by the scientific constitution and the media.
With it being possible to move the "bars" (sic) involving managers, a recent survey of Ipsos has shown on Figaro.fr's website, which only consolidates the management staff in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a basic observation into all the intentions and practices of management : For employees, commitments towards the company will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies of Motivating functional analysis are concerned with this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their businesses on the basis of a pre-defined dox that allows them, through an image that tells them about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to pursue their goals in life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate on their "social performance" and put their human resource management "on the right track".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of sound and effective economic intelligence.
Speech from Oslo: "just war" Obama earned praise from the right.
The American Right welcomed on Friday the speech that Barack Obama made the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defending the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who at first mocked the award to Obama on October 9, applauded this time the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former vice president candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, declared Palin, a muse of right-wing Republican wing, for the U.S. Journal Today, and added that she herself expressed herself on the subject of the "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs that are currently coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessorGeorge W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Obama's next opponent, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the President had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated by the former House of Representatives President, who praised the President's mention of the "existence of evil in the world" in particular.
In a way, I considered this speech to be quite historic, Gingrich stated during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
A former MP whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election was thrilled to see "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee," that they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the Peace Prize if the use of forces did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speech writer George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama gave a "very American speech".
He not only introduced himself as a "world citizen" as always, but "he spoke like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they themselves did not create, and that they do not do too much to preserve it", assessed Gerson.
A few disgruntled right-wings include Bush era hawks, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "unifying, pompous and uninspiring", as he stated on the National Review Online website.
Left of the President, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified at looking at Barack Obama as he justifies the use of forces.
"When we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people", he warned.
However, the medium-left press takes a commendable position on the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the Peace Prize to Obama premature, it assessed his performance as an "overperformance" even for a speaker known for his talents.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in combating poverty and oppression", says the California daily.
Obama "made the speech as needed", assessed the New York Times, and called the speech "simple and instructive".
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement that saves the delivery of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, the road hauliers' union and TLF, the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the strike call and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, during Friday's signing of the agreement, expressed "joy" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of the discussion, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning, hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unista, OTRE) have resigned from negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting that started at 11:00 to get everyone to agree and to sign the deal at 6:00.
This conflict "would hurt businesses greatly" and "would threaten to disrupt the holidays at the end of the year", Bussereau said.
The text contains an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained by Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we'll give our members an order to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may still be a few opponents who are not satisfied, "supplied.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was hard to admit an increase in high salaries due to the international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and by EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is a common sense and respect agreement against employees, declared by CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a revalorisation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also enable a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a €100 million reduction in corporate payroll taxes" which was the subject of the Government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on the night of Thursday on Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a 'congruent' vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to undertakings which are members of this organisation, later to the whole sector, in case of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "as soon as possible", assured Bussereau.
Only employers’ organisations’ disapproval can slow the whole process.
The FNTR talks about "bad trade" because EUR 100 million "the sector has already been offered as part of the carbon tax compensation".
The Minister of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but as a result of unfurnishing turkey eaters at the time of the coming Christmas holidays, Unista complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to "buy a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field" over the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: break of traffic over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP transport company.
The interruption of traffic on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because Friday's negotiations between the union and RATP the next day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of applying for the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, i.e. the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only run between 10 and 20 o'clock, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) each other train, outside of this section only one train out of four.
Connecting with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette's stores, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP sought to secure connections with large department stores".
RER A line leads from west to east to Paris' agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in service and practically no train was running at the time off-peak as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion at the platforms.
So early in the morning there were much fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things because pupils and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he rose by "an hour and a half early to be sure he would arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare railway station was not crowded, it announced the SNCF State Railway, for a greater number of orderlys and guardians of order were predicted.
The suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station with a metro connection.
Other general gatherings of strikers will take place on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon meeting with the leadership, which the unions rated "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER A trains in all aspects, working time adjustments, careers, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (South Department).
RATP even postponed proposals on the premium for the time being, which upset CGT, saying that the management "was unable to solve the problem while the travel carriers and SNCF were able to do so".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, the conditions for the pursuit of the profession will be "closely reviewed", RATP specified the transport undertakings.
Which is why the union thinks the business "makes weekend travelers fun".
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the corporate committee at its Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calming down".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents have announced a strike alert.
The unions request a premium of between EUR 120 (Unsa) and EUR 150, of which EUR 30 is variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Independents (Independents)) and make it difficult for worsening working conditions on this line to carry a million passengers daily.
RER suburban train drivers earn between €2200 and €2700 gross wages in a more advanced career and €600 to €650 bonuses for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish party, and this decision has heavy consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday to abolish the main Pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which seeks to hand a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it became "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said Hasim Kilic, President of the Supreme Court, after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, when it was necessary for the dissolution of the party by a majority of seven votes, Kiliç stated and added that 37 party cadres, including its President Ahmet Türk and Member Aysela Tugluk, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluc and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (of 500).
The party's leadership has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than appear in it as Members without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic link" with the PKK, but refuses to refer to it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the court comes when the government hands a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights, attempting to limit Kurds' support for the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to the resumption of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations have degenerated in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained into clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the decision of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered before the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, mostly inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, protestors threw Molotov cocktails again or shot stones from the slings.
Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people demonstrated.
Following the verdict, Mr Türk stated that justice's decision would only "increase despair".
Turkey cannot solve this question by banning the party, stated in the press.
The government, formed by a party arising from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We're against party interference.
It doesn't solve anything, Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete blast of the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course we can look forward to a reaction from the PKK side, added.
On Thursday, PKK volunteered for one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come
Pretty crispy cold, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter department of technical services FES.
But so his employees can test and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This weekend this could happen for the first time, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES is following an accurate plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they go to 20 so-called sections of A large-scale sprinklers, explains Brauburger.
These sections include major and transit movements such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descent as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle moist salt, which is better held, around 1040 kilometres [1040 km] within a maximum of three hours.
Therefore, the FES begins at three o'clock at night to "make the roads clear when traffic begins to work".
It's hard when it doesn't start snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers".
Only when it does not snow so much are the arrival and interconnection roads on the line, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side roads and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES pawns set out on the road, priority being to clean dangerous places and transitions.
The FES usually can't take care of all the bike paths.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that monitors mainly bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As they quickly form an iceberg, the sprinklers leave as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: Animal two metres long and 1.50 metres high ran on two strong hind limbs, had an oblong skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelegs with sickle claws and long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas, Austin, and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine write that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characters.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He's showing us a lot about kinships, expansions, and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations in Ghost Ranch, north of New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for Triassic deposits, informing team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were identified quickly by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected remains from a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an unusual find: "The photos of dinosaurs from the Triassic are very rare, mostly only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
Especially sensational this finding is not, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says perhaps Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
In the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
A lot of the oldest fossils aren't complete, which is why the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards split into the three most important development lines: carnivorous teropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and birds, "longnecks" of four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores of Ornithischia (birds), such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues' original terapod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
Researchers, for example, found evidence of air sacs on the skull of Tawa hallae, which even the offspring of terrapods have birds.
Thanks to air bags, bird breathing is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the spine bones were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the line of giant sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably created by the common ancestor of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
As so far known most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, scientists deduced that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines had already split up early and spread from South America to all continents, which at the time as the Pangea supercontinent formed a uniform earth mass.
The fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related terrapods, would also explain this.
The three can't come from one common, migrated ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to the group of the hardest dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted picture, as very many primitive dinosaur fossils have remained in South America, rarely found on other continents.
As dinosaurs proved, from the relatively rare sideline of the reptile family to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Middle Ages, it still remains a puzzle.
During the Triasus, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while relatives died out and the interface of the Triassic and Jurassic.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses as to how to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been mass extinctions that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push out the competition.
In any case, the history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, the meteorite impact helped another group of animals, who also evolved into a triassic and lived in the shadow since then: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paula, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clean-up of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University took care of the worldwide commotion.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth universities, but also colleges throughout Germany, Europe, and North and South America solidarity with protesters students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they do not "approve" the presidium fueled by police intervention.
As the walls and artwork were painted, university president Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied last week by striking students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
Damage to the cause, judged by signatories, does not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching by students and teaching by police commando".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable intervention" into the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegality and criminalization of protest" and distracts attention from content.
The presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers are calling for a halt to criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support material damage.
Authorised protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union also solidarize with students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says the mysterious Earth youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessen Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmannová (CDU) is currently defending the procedure of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destroying and cast are completely unacceptable means, she said Thursday at the Aktuellen Stunde (current hour) in the Wiesbaden Landstag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said MP of the Earth's Assembly for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of SPD, Green and Link saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls for an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, it was cleared out.
Linke submitted a proposal calling on the Home Secretary to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For years, it has been paying for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district, with 216,000 inhabitants, is considered 37 kilometers from the Moscow Center, to be "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, Greengrad representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt Research Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were multiple mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Vice Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, under Frankfurt signed the head of planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will go to the seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ companies will be allowed to encroach on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian science firms want to get orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for gun research.
Zelenograd (literal translation of the "Green City") earned its name according to the wooded hilly landscape, into which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared at all.
For project supporters, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than starting a railway station, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade into desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks that ended in the city centre were then considered transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, as it took enormously much time to switch locomotives from behind forward.
Pull over, pull over, move on - that's how it should work.
And that's why head stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly halfway through the trans-European railway station route between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with S21, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves have learned that the start of construction is almost unfunded in the Hessen and Bavarian cities.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and steering vehicles at both ends, head stations no longer have difficulty driving and driving.
Still: Starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
Earth and municipal politicians pushed it through.
The railways cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistly, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain many greens.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
Passing stations and construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which was typically attributed to a huge increase in the 1980s.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
But modern transport policy must primarily be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road truck transport.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
More importantly, S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it to be a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, funding will be missing at other knot points and narrow sites in the network.
There are sixty larger projects on the Ministry of Transport list.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on this route at a slow pace.
There'd be a lot of pressure here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The line through the Rhine Valley will become the throat of a bottle of international freight transport: right at the heart of Europe.
The Government is examining the judgment on the airport
The Earth Government left the Wiesbaden House open if it went against the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) ruling on the ban on night flights and had it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition commissioned experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH judgment, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
Today, VGH in Kassel explained in writing that the State would have to redefine the night-time flight ban in case of construction of the planned northwestern runway of Frankfurt airport.
The permission for 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as assumed by the Earth Government, does not correspond to the statutory order to protect the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will require a revision of the sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged representatives of the government to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel faction called on the CDU and the FDP to return to promises regarding the ban on night flights that she had made before the election. Otherwise, it can be assessed as "a violation of the given word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green Tarek's boss Al-Wazir in reference to the FDP electoral slogan "We keep the word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's reprimand, the Earth government tries to get to its night flights through "rotting the law and tricks".
Exact legal control needs its time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of the "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The claims of his faction to ban night flights were never the same as that of the opposition.
America’s banks are paying off aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
The Bank of America suddenly paid off aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund in total of $45 billion (around €30 billion) on Wednesday.
According to a report by the US CNBC station, Citigroup plans to repay state aid as well.
Thus, the constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have been imposed by the adoption of money - the reduction of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America obtained good $19 billion of net money from investors thanks to exchangeable bonds.
She took the rest of the amount from her cashier, which was filled, among other things, by trade union sales.
On Wednesday night, bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer: Money injections helped us to overcome difficult times.
The Institute of Money has harmed itself at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by providing money in the capital market.
CNBC informed with reference to sources that this US bank could have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion already on Thursday.
Citigroup's spokesperson didn't want to comment on it.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley already paid off the aid.
Quick Option
After all, it went faster than expected.
The station introduced a successor just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the grémium wanted to agree on the person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital in Berlin, was referred to as the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially, so that it wouldn't get ahead of the process.
However, the role could also have played that they did not want to harm the Intendant of ZDF Markus Schächter if this proposal had not passed with the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine out of 14 members of the grémium.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter crashed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though one could expect.
The U.S. majority on the board of directors signaled already a few weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
Resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to further remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief by arguing that, under Brender, the ZDF's reporting ratings had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, there were protests in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
For the last time, even 35 state law lawyers were mixed into the debate, which considered Koch's approach unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 switched Frey to ZDF, first into "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main studio of the ZDF.
After being deposed by a media magazine journalist of the year on Wednesday, Brender, who was elected as a specialist periodical journalist of the year, announced to the Greens that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's anti-candidacy on the board of directors, Rhineland-false Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor Peter Frey commanded the board with a clever chess move - immediately after the overthrow of Brender, he strongly criticized the grémium for it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could be nominated for the post of editor without losing his face by both Schächter and could be elected by the board of directors without getting suspected that the party would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is still ranked left-wing liberals.
Studies get rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the Ministers of Culture finally went to the Länder on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors, both parties agreed that it was the will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: Essentially, each study module should be terminated with one single test.
In addition, the workload of the students should be re-checked and a "real and advocable rate" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and colleges want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal States undertake to create a more flexible joint structure assignment for bachelor and master's degree courses.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the start of student protests in the worm, the ministers of culture and university speakers have had winged words in their mouth about a better study.
They are now for the first time filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided that the number of tests will partly drastically reduce: "Every module will usually be terminated only once by the exam", says a 30-page report, which is to partly newly regulate the approval of study fields.
"Excellently lower test burden", said the president of the Reinhold Grimm Accreditation Board, is to be "stopped by a flawed development that greatly limited the intensity of the study."
To this end, the "satisfactory of study" in the future is to be a "deciding criterion" in implementation.
Modules and contents "must be rechecked hard" so that the students do not "unnecessaryly limit when choosing
seminars".
Students should "claim for space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study after examination.
These need to be "recredited" every five years – which means, however, it will take until 2015 to re-check all fields of study.
There are ten accreditation agencies all over Germany that are subject to accreditation boards established by the Länder.
Culture ministers called on the "emphasis" of the Land in October to act on agencies so that the content of the curriculum would not be too large and the testing regime would not be strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the Land Ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional resources for further development of the Bologna Process.
From money, universities should primarily pay for consultation programs and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
That is what countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to give parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Act.
According to her, only one single test should be needed to finish the study module.
Formation of the study should be even more flexible, so that recognition of examinations from other universities is guaranteed and access to the master should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, the demands of all fields of study in the country should be rechecked.
The government and opposition argued again on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Juso called for the creation of education policy not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and college rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word should be spoken to" also students as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need student experience", she said on Thursday at one meeting with the Culture Ministers, with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), Bonn's resolutions did not go far enough: they demand a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree to access an extension master's degree.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that for today's generation of bachelor's students sufficient space is available tomorrow in master's degree fields with the best possible study conditions, said a member of the board of directors of GEW Andreas Keller.
The Federal lands must employ far more lecturers.
Culture ministers did not comment on free access to master's programs.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and getting out is nice, almost no control..." reads the opening line of one poem by poet Werner Söllner, who in this torn-out language piece focuses on the experience of arriving one dissident who has gained freedom, but at the same time lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in one children's book publishing house, 1982 then relocated to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been Head of the Hesen Literature Forum in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
A considerable extraliteral commotion was handled last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of her safety act".
Apparently disconcerted and stupefied Söllner left a statement in which he confesses to cooperation in front of fellow writers of Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as a secret informant for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German Language Award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts were said to have started inconspicuously, at first in 1971.
I, continued Söllner, "that is, someone who did not resist enough attempts at intimidation from the Securitate side."
The poet Werner Söllner is Secret Agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize award of Herta Müller and its unparalleled literary settlement with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors originating in Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and nefariousness of the political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said by the state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but is also the victim.
In the Securitate acts, Secret Agent Walter played some role, said after Söllner's confession, Michael Markel, referring to a positive influence on himself as Secret Agent Walter.
"He chopped" me out at the time at all points of importance to him, says Markel.
He has a moral duty to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but the most surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote as early as July when she read her own act, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for spies Securities.
Concerned, one can assume, they will speculate, and in some cases also probably know which name is hidden behind the alias Sorin, Voicu and just as Walter.
Other than in the domestic, in the meantime a very certain examination of the Stazi components, handling the estate of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and restricted.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of the Securitate (CNSAS), was only established in 1999, the issue of the act has since been rather lengthy.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of files.
After publishing the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, former members of the Securitate still have a great influence in Romania, he gave one interview in which one of the former Securitate bosses from Timisoara expressed a reluctance about the award winner.
She said she had psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The disgrace of power has been expressed completely in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, inevitable questions are involved in the case of Söllner, as well as in the context of a concealed wrongdoing.
Why now? Who was harmed? A special reaction by the listeners to Söllner's confession is expected that the continuation of this chapter will determine a desire for knowledge rather than after acquitting guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
The Champions League Saturated Deposit
It looked like a clean-dressed sales rep came from a cute Christmas party at which he was handing out sports goods candy when he was boarding a Class C Mercedes called in 15 minutes after midnight with a new VfBr coach Christian Gross accompanied by an orange-coloured bag sponsor. "
A man with distinctive baldness had himself driven around a foreign city for him.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk luck was a 55-year-old man also little.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work will continue.
Or it's just about to start.
In the words of only three days of engaged Swiss: "Sice we have achieved eight-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to a win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: It will be a brutally hard fight against descent."
"A little more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance in Mainz from the royal class and in the ordinary league day.
And avoid re-evident weaknesses after three quick goals by Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Lotting
The Champions League eight-finals (outing 16./17. + 23./24 February/retaliatory matches 9/10. + 16./17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
Thus, the joy of Babbel’s stark succession will remain preserved.
Not only for the supposed healer, who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to engage and pleasure in the game within a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be bolder, explained the Gross soul healer so simply sounding a successful recipe, which, however, showed no more effectiveness during the work of Babbel's therapist.
He stirred up certain magic, admitted Babbel's adherent Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after many weeks of break caused by injury, became, thanks to his dynamics, the very best player on the field, tried to describe the identified "phenomena" by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Apparently, Babbel was missing it.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against a weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of a Romanian guest.
They would have won even in Glasgow before a nasty awakening came after defeating 0:4 in Leverkusen, considering Khedira.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not out of the woods yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home win after three months, was caused by weekend events that freshly revived in the form of a television interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann just before the game began.
There are decisions that others and not Jens act, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He pitched to the board of weak leadership and decided to change coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Even that he had cancelled his free day after the matches, Lehmann marked as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "pronounce pure egoism", replied Heldt and announced a sequence for goalkeepers.
Both of them in their 40 ’ s will probably have no more joy in life.
In any case, they agree with others that without the job of a deposed coaching team it would not be possible to play such a strong and combatant performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "large share of success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
Heavyweight World Championship match
The Passionate Duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of World Champion Vitali Klitschka.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The referees' statement was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night at Bern.
For Klitschko it is the third successful defending title after his return in October 2008.
Prior to that, Ukraine was twice the WBO and WBC World Champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the one everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional duels, twice he was defeated due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena he drove a 2.02-foot-high Klitschko fight primarily with his left.
11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Klička's era before the duel, withdrew before hitting the world champion, so Kličko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In total, passive Johnson did little to challenge the challenger, and he was just trying to get into the next round.
Although the circle provoked words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
But still, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko for twelve full rounds.
The challenger took care of the commotion in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschka as a "repulsive zombie" who "can't do anything properly".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion got provoked, pulled his sunglasses off Johnson's nose so he could see his eyes.
Fourth win after Kliček's return
Klitschko remained undefeated even after the fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008.
After nearly a four-year break, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to hand over without a fight before.
That year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in defending the title and in September Chris Arreol of the USA.
In this duel I only got one punch and physically in good shape, justified Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
His dream remains, however, the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the World Champion of WBO and IBF organizations.
The WBA belt, however, is worn by British David Haye, after he deposed 2.13 metres high Nikolai Vulaev in November.
Haye canceled the fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
Allegedly, his promoter company is planning a fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
The frontal attack from the opposition: The head of the Green Jürgen Trittin faction called Guttenberg a liar due to misinformation regarding the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Linke (Levice) call on the Chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed conscious deception.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "knowingly false", said Green Jürgen Trittin faction chief on Saturday's ARD news show "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual term: he lied.
The killing order was issued in disregard of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO, read by Mr Guttenberg, was told by Trittin.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not just about the destruction of hijacked trucks, it was about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's investigation, as many as 142 people were killed or injured in an American air raid requested by German Kunduzu commander Colonel Klein.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Federal Assembly and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Assembly - and whether the Office of Chancellor, Bundeswehr and intelligence have approved this new strategy, called on Jürgen Tritin and fellow Greens Renate Künast.
Ulrich Wilhelm, a spokesman for the government, rejected criticism.
The Chancellor's Office has no influence on the particular deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the Ministry's trial of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL's information, both Guttenberg were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on tanks.
Officially, it was said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the vicinity of both senior officials, it was said that they had drawn attention to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, among them to a two-page document by commanding Colonel Klein and to one report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert in the meantime had requested in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The Ministry did not comment on the criticisms on Saturday and pointed out that this would be addressed in the Federal Assembly of Inquiry Committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in a watchful state and hear voices that others do not see and hear.
Not just mentally ill or intoxicated drugs, there are lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with wildest fantasies and fantasy delusions.
However, those who are awake in dreamy states see and hear things that others do not see and hear, pay mostly in the Western world as a fool or drug addict, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in mentally ill or intoxicated drugs.
Guilt has our imaginations: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality merge here and there.
Dreams of altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in better cases we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, however, the vision of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of raving, psychosis and hallucinations can be deduced from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain is derailed - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenia.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has employed philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of awake dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great similarity of deliriousness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions of senses".
It is fall 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and loudly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, hovering at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with bloody red grimas, precious teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery shoes, throw him against a wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten to come from walls and radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that call him names and insults him.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, locks them into a loop and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
Loop allows.
Learn, the choir voices are screaming, tearing his drums, "go to the clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today is Henning's T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD has been launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, besides being manic depressive, taking antidepressant drugs, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime by schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is after the depression of the second most frequently treated disease.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the affected can mostly no longer distinguish the inner and outside world, they get an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
A hearing of voices is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations aren't uncommon.
The affected is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as a dream opens the psychosis of the flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenik is located in the center of the action, everything has significance directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenic therefore often feels threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible with them, ghosts are a terrible fact, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucinations
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of experience occurs within the real framework.
Scientists are still standing in front of the puzzle, why exactly our brain is doing these flips.
Exceptional states can lead every person to lose a short-term relationship with reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
There appears to be genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that affected persons have minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, such as the mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle as to how the neuronal system malfunctions, which has not been manifested for many years.
The role is also played by the influences of the surroundings - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if there is a disposition to it.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When Our Brains Get Confused
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medicines, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irrereale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline personality or depression also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or cerebral trauma.
Surprisingly, the brain of a healthy person is hallucinating under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of ideas that are normally suppressed.
They arise when parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or too little suppressed; if our brain is encased, or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries with love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of those polled have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Meklenbursk-Front Pomerania and attending the gymnasium there.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If there weren't any patterns and voices.
On intermissions, she may be approached by a cocolonate with long, dark hair.
When he answers, his classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her can see and hear this boy.
This shy girl is considered an uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, he knows that.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to each other in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? He asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappear again.
In the night, the appearances are rather depressing
Often delusions are burdensome.
When he sits in class, he can't watch teaching many times because a teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the board of mathematical equations.
At night, the displays are rather depressing.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, he cannot often tell whether he is awake or whether he is asleep, whether the images he sees, the grimas, or the girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and legs arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends anything about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone crazy.
The illusions are also the art of despair
If anyone's socially isolated or his stimuli are taken, he'll most likely be hallucinating, says Kasten.
I guess the brain doesn't have enough jobs and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she'd called Dad since she was thinking herself has not been her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas that also process real sensations and sounds are active, it is hard for the disabled as Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, also reality is displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to develop, therefore it acts so real."
Night dreams also evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises their patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world of too much consciousness, imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroidal states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the affected considers real and cannot even recognizably distinguish them from the alert state.
Oneiroidal state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as polyradicular inflammation patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a man is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by a lasting, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality it is impossible to handle a situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will be present to the imagination.
An intense form of support for senses and the transfer of senses in an intolerable situation that allows people to form, to go into loss of consciousness within a moment.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Interchange of Heart) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after surgery of the heart valve with subsequent heart transplants, his consciousness became known for a few days, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man bedridden, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility that makes narcotic substances out of blood.
On a motorcycle, a Greek kidnaps him to his homeland, surfs a company in the Alps on a hospital bed and meets a Korean mobster.
It sinks completely into imaginary activity, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is a different state, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clear in years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oniroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in a watchful state.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summed up by psychologist Kasten, "may lead to deformation of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be rewarding.
Snow can come
Burda
At 27, they're supposed to take over the publishing houses.
The new head of Kallen publishing house is a transitional solution: Long-term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business long in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We've dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked after that.
The question is, do they have the ability to do that?
It is not possible to place 7500 employees in charge of their children if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the children and the business.
Burda announced Thursday that he was withdrawing from the board's presidency as of January, and appointed as his successor Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury section, responsibility for the company's assets was added and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also direct marketing, Foreign, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "cross 10, 15 years", Burda said.
Holding should also belong 100 percent to the family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are unsure of the demise: "It has always touched companies who have been infected with the desire for capital that they speculated and thought could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power", Burda claims.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming, and this is the time when it is appropriate to find out what celebrities wear, and to adapt their ceremonial wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which must be noted.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa Energy Company, along with the Barcelona City Hall, founded 'Live Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' Office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) sets out and will manage the roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVELE, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the participating sectors.
Overall, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
These are three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVELE Plan to support the deployment of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Catalan Government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa's participation in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a quiet period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero anticipates that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is awaiting a "rest period".
In the 2009 Prime Minister's economic report Zapatero summed up the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a competitive roadmap for the automotive sector, we would be faced today with the state of abandonment, the closure of some of our major manufacturing enterprises", said the Prime Minister.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of calm is envisaged for this industry in the future, which is our main export sector", he added.
In this respect, he noted that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Plan for the Car Industry (PIA), identified 800 million for 19 producers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of over EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment was intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed government support measures and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President's comments, this plan allowed the average emission level for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and ensured a "significant increase" in the entries, namely by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 sqm, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid also products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renewal of cars; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialist firm Mercedes Benz.
External competence tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentration, sports performances, tests of adaptability, presentations and auditions.
Eligibility tests for classic cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition zone will also be carried out.
Mazda3 i-Stop: retaining sports style
Mazda intends to show that gentleness to the surrounding environment has no negative effect on sports style.
Therefore, Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start-up system - also christened jaki-Stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a petrol engine 2.0 150 hp.
This second generation ofMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface finishing, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent for Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using the tool and console assembly, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in developing futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style also presented by Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and more specifically with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish for a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start-up system is only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise levels, performance and lower consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometres per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater comfort while driving and reduced consumption.
In terms of equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, the lane monitoring system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, thrust and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirror, large-screen onboard computer, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels, should be mentioned.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, at an extra cost of €1,500: adaptable lights twoxenon and BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars of its category.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not drive more than a mile per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine 2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is €21.770 for Luxura and €23.270 for tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxurious 'Premier'
L. A. has a red carpet, as gentle as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the 'Nine' brand. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek promise
Peek is extremely limited, only used to browse the mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine appreciated him as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see him outside, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-fold amount.
FonPeek, which was introduced at the Le Web event yesterday, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as well as its American counterpart, but brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or eagerly search for a WiFi cafe (or Fon connection) so they can view the mail.
The solid-price rooming idea is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so as to be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it continues to have the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) achieves this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid when purchased, not after months.
And this is exactly what I expect to happen in the case of FonPeek, this is the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best consumer type.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on the computer.
The color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to become president of the US, she chose a dress and coat in this color, also choosing the same color when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow green with glittering effects-, in both cases it was a three-part ensemble - dress, jacket and coat made of the same cloth - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The cloth from which the clothing is made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of joining Michelle, she used large lace, in Oslo velvet printed.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with medium-high sole, now similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears various hairstyles: this time a bun, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have motherhood-related work problems.
In recent years, discrimination in employment has increased, especially among women of younger years who intend to have a child.
This is the result of a study of 'The Plodity and Labour Career of Spanish Women' conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9.737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 and results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities due to motherhood.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in the opinion of the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, formerly deliver the first child and overall have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner coexistence and motherhood, delay and have fewer descendants.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have the first child on average 3.7 years since the beginning of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted a greater part of their lives to achieving stable employment and have therefore had to postpone the cohabitation and arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although a minor influence on the time of starting cohabitation with a partner", explains Margarita Delgado, who is dedicated to research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting women’s age at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher the age of women getting married and having their first child.
Differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25,1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education get married and give birth to the first child before they find stable employment, while women with medium or high education go the other way around preferring to get a stable job, before they marry and give birth to the first child", Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress becomes the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm Worth It'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, is thus added to other famous L'Oréal Paris personalities such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before she was joined by this selected club actress Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from the hut').
The men's section of this cosmetic brand is also represented by prominent personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Prizes
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, both earlier and present - met at the annual award ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
There was no one missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicent Poker
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of writers he has encountered in his literary life (and in some cases even in everyday life) in 'Ess Poker' (Alfaguara, illustration of Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent does not spare shocks or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s delight, even with repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of anti-destination, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humour, without sense, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been abounded with passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven through the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey published in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often collapse."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
In his own right, he said he was the heir of a landowner from the county, other times he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, these were great dreams."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer intercepted on the bridge the deranged cry of this man from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the XXth century in his literary form, running from himself and calling out for the future and sharply speaking to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After effort comes a dream,/ after a storm of calm harbor,/after war rest,/after a full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage, he also carried his depression.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Eduard VII had followed her among the azaleans or that the birds had sung Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent goes hand in hand with foolishness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else was it about Martín Santos, other than targeting Joyce at Baroja?
What else was it about Benet but having Baroja executed by Faulkner's weapon?
What else did Cel want but to make himself famous at the expense of that man's glory?"
Coward aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother passed through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrad County, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed a round and our dog, a cross-breed rescued from a shelter of a maximum of six kilograms, kicked him twice without a word and badly injured him.
Our indignation is even greater that we do not see anything amusing in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which was also on a leash.
In addition, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she met these individuals on a walk, began to fear for her own safety, for such a devil-crazed man who attacked an animal is able to do the same to a woman, child, old man, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint against the nearest Commissioners, but we doubt that it was of any use, and to avoid raising delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were Spanish nationalities.
Indignation moved us to announce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to today’s youth when they entertain themselves by tormenting a defenseless animal who gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We don't understand where proper manners went, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in cooperation with the Spanish Railway Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly for younger motorists, as both of these entities informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only means to prevent head injuries or death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their obligations regarding transport security, which "means more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it seeks to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. by means of an instruction and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of a helmet while riding a motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when up to more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be put up posts to become known to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety "is a permanent problem" of this company, which is a tyre manufacturer for two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures of patronage organization of Anfac producers and Ganvam sellers.
However, the favourable figure is better quarantined, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparisons and marked a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
As of January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/vehicles.
And neither did the glooms that harm demand the most, even though they were bought by private individuals, much of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized firms, and almost 100% of the cases were financed through third parties.
Other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a poor economic situation must be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the 2000E purchase support did not help much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the persons who are doing business on a small and medium-sized company trade licence, who intend to purchase a light commercial car up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again recalled the need for special attention to be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (kamoons and buses).
The sales association assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, the sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, this will also be with ESP stability control, handbrake aid systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others, a deadline is set to address the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, and it works by helping to prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in the emergency case, which the system finds out after the driver steps down.
But it doesn't always hold that pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by Bosch auto parts manufacturer, a third of the drivers who have an accident did not hit the brake before the collision, and half of them did not fully use the brake strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 fatal pedestrian-related accidents per year could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more marked-according to calculations would prevent one of the four accidents affecting persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, he will help increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel's employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will be launched in the first week of April -probably on April 8- as reported by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, tries to get every point of the plan first agreed with the party involved.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which production facilities are located, may be issued with delay in early 2010.
On the contrary, GM assures that the sale decision of Saab should be taken these days.
No wonder the Swedish government raised pressure on US manufacturers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One could be Geely, who also wishes to get a Volvo, but considers the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper operating under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the absence of any agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to Baic, China.
It continues to apply at the end of Saab's year to close if it fails to sell it.
Ride with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, thus the weight shows only1.275 kg.
Based on this, first of all, the automatic retractable roof is in a canvas design with manual control, reducing weight by 21 kg; additional aluminium doors such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; removing air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a weight reduction of another 7 kg; after installing the sports seats an additional 12 kg, thanks to the lightweight 19-inch wheels up to another five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile straps means another kilogram.
It is also available with a two-component PDK transmission, a single vehicle with a hand-operated six-speed box, mainly on second-class roads in California, was tested on mountain sections with many complex turns.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not printed to asphalt.
On the contrary: we have not tested such a small and light model in a long time, which would also transfer such safety when moving in a curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete able to warm the muscles while driving for a short period of time until we order him to sprint, brake, and restore the use of the engine...
Whatever we want, driving that's as communicative as accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound according to will
The sound of the V6 boxer, by 320 horsepower (by 10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and it is possible to amplify it with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used by Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
The curtains are rigid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we're passing through with Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; while we hit some corners at dawn on the icing and gravel even in the advanced morning.
Definitely, this ultralight car is one of the most entertaining on the market, as it is slightly more than simply modifying Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010 at a price of EUR70.831.
'Bag Girl'
Girlfriend Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Coco Cocoon series and occasional 'starlette' at the 'firms' shows, the singer performs her face of the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia has given herself a victory in Israel
She won a brilliant win in 82-91 while hosting on Maccabi Elektra's complicated field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice squad, and thus reached the lead of her group after a large performance by Mirzy Teletovice, who with eight triple points was announced the best in the squad (29 ratings).
The Vitoria squad managed to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic's great dose of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win the victory.
In addition, great accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points was much involved in the final triumph.
The match began with a face for blue, who had stood on the mark from the beginning.
The first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicating that they had attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava squad opted for the internal play of Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by whistles and applause while returning to its original assignment to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to prove himself to be the best in his squad with 13 points, although 'without six' in Splitter' ratings already indicated that it would not be the best night for Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that everyone on their field did not win, and 'the hand of Elías' they could win.
Eidson and Pni certainly contributed to making 'yellow' return to the sun (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, wounded, but not dead at all, needed several precise games to take their breath, and in that appeared a machine gun Mirza Teletovic, which three triples almost consecutively and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a soothing number of (54-67), which reached the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavians worked their skin off in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not be allowed to be deprived of their deserved results for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the squad alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter voted out for foul seIvanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries make it impossible Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos and left him the lead of Group B in the Euroliga in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but primarily by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga squad did not intimidate the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, nor the opponent, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusans to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillet Rubia, lit up the pitch with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja , although the arsenal of locals in an indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when a fight between US supportersBeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek squad began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both zones, where the absence of English pivot due to Joel Freeland's injury and three personal mistakes by Carlos Jiménez weighed down Unicaja's squad
Between internal players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Rematch
The third part was very offensive from the Olympiacos side, which despite losing by 19, proved superior and even managed to balance the difference from the match in Malaza Málaga 66-48, a minute of 27 that shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish Pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to leadership and triple points Cook and Lewis's contribution left certain hope n winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to strength and superiority in centimetres in its zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.

The tool How much should you take? calculates user salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you need to insert a profession, years of experience, age and city where the interested person wishes to work.
During the week the app works, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally "feeling poorly rewarded", explained in his Albert Rivera report responsible for Trovit product.
According to the data available to Trovit from their search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes €45.226 gross annually and €31.059 French, while the Spaniard receives $24,000.
Likewise, the driver has a salary of EUR 34.247 net per year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with €1.592 net per year; followed by a salesman with €14.725 and a worker with €15.667.
The most wanted jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver, part-time employment, and social worker.
Brazil set a date for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge".
The station also cited a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government", Zelaya stated by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that he was trying to impose on the government "de facto", chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where officials take decisions about the future, which in itself is uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise the market was the liquidation of debt by direct purchase of assets and indirect liquidity release at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could buy out assets.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into gears, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in a return in reducing risk returns.
The exchange’s mobility and bond differences have regained points, although they are still very distant from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, they press for quality, and the US, Japan, and Germany have become a haven for elected investors, extending the distinction between euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was almost not affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of a reduction in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useful to silence proponents of moral risk, who tried to re-burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy due to the braking of the devastating consequences of limiting credit to employment when, in fact, a new Thanksgiving day would need to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles between emirs to restore power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, the elections, and the new government begins.
Prodi did this in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro to fail to fulfil its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is for Ecofin to force the Greek government into transparency and commitment of its own citizens to joint responsibility when emergency measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the period of normalisation of bonuses from the transitional risk, after some excesses in supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we need not be concerned.
If European differences are reduced and ours continue to expand, this would typically be a Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to predict their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 rise scenario including the OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese script, it does not give the Spanish economy much hope of surviving this warning.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "carefully, friend driver".
Related sectors
President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first yesterday to intervene in front of the House of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy is being discussed in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by the appearance of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made several comments to the press on the proposal submitted by the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of €50,000 by 2020 and an additional 60,000 million from that date to 2030, if nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue has changed, and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal power plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft of the Sustainable Economy Act, which has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line that the company demanded, did not want to release blood as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate change policy.
In his view, "clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "accurate" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start taking place now, because their maturation persists and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial won 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for airport land services, Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of preferential companion of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which the economic terms have not yet expired, has been in force for five years.
On the other hand Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a cooperation protocol to create a Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% falls on Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona struggles for its first concession on the motorway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The construction involved is a tunnel estimated at $1,700 million of Australian dollars (about EUR 1,047 million).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and German Hochtief.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for Acciona to settle in that country as a construction and concession highway.
City Hall wishes to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
Following the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to initials in English) for further development of the project in the business plan covered by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of tolls.
Tenders are expected to be submitted in May, and the projected investment will reach US$1,700 million (€1.047 million) and, at the last stage, three companies competing with a significant presence in European constructions.
The group called Transcity is led by Accion, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Gella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies, and the second based in Italy is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona Group, the Northern Direct Group is in play with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French Bouygues Building Group.
The third and last group, which passed through the network, is called LBRJV and participates in the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also local Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and an important company specialised in civil construction Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatisations, but it carries with it a clear difficulty of entry in a way other than the medial acquisition of the local construction company.
In addition to Asian references, the strategy followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted company Leighton.
Million assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as a power supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of businesses that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter and operate infrastructures.
The underground toll road, the promoter of which is the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link (north coupling), is to connect the western Toowong motorway with the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) of a length of 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest event to reduce Brisbane traffic congestion.
The calendar set by the local administration plans to be commissioned for summer 2010 and start work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to project in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide US$500 million (308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia still brings a significant profit, as it announced yesterday a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The unit ACS will operate through its local Leighton file the infrastructure of the national wide band network with fiber optic cable.
This situation will allow quick internet access to 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the King George tower building project on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction works were just about to begin, and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC was assigned a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpine file, the FCC received an allocation of a tunnel construction of 2.1 kilometres in length for a €64.5 million motorway in Slovenia.
The firm obtained the contract a few days after the works were carried out to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Shit. Rushmore got a commercial at Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services over the last two years to the Agency Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros per year, informed the company operating the railway.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Shit. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented themselves in a bankruptcy announced by Renfe, of which four advanced to the final, among them TBWA, which was responsible for creating advertising over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of designing and producing campaigns.
Fine 63 million for France Télécom for braking competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France imposed a fine of €63 million on lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the margin of regulation.
By this sanctions, the former French monopoly and still the state company has bought more than EUR 560 million of fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to their competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased, because the office that oversees the competition believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that, therefore, there has been a recurrence.
Application Business
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and opened a online app shop to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app trade will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League brought from the beginning 474.4 million Madrid and Barçe
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made $476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
Manchester United runs the charter.
Manchester United runs the charter.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
Up to the point that the competition divided EUR 5,362.5 million among 105 cooperatives (of which 12 Spanish) participating in this event since the tournament was established in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money it won for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won the three-time main prize.
The Catalan current champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is run by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two teams, which additionally charged the most money to participate in the previous Champions League.
Even though she lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that won the most money through Champions, although it won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by the complex method used by UEFA to distribute money.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to make $1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA devotes 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary classification round (among other Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have achieved participation have received 3.8 million for their presence alone, in addition to an additional EUR 550,000 for each match they participate in.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (40,000 for each squad). Eight finalists get three million each; eight quarter finalists get 3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion makes 9 million, while the second finalist makes 5.2 million.
This way the club will earn at least 7.1 million on fixed payments and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million are intended.
This money is divided by the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned seats.
The champion of last year will receive 40% of allotted money, the second 30%, third20% and fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
Yesterday, Nueva Rumasa published details of the offer to buy shares, with which it wants to gain a top place between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share that would be paid at 10 years of age and would pay interest for this deferral1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at EUR 1.85; therefore, Nueva Rumasa's offer evaluates the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the fair value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 board members.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateo confirmed that it had merged with the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would be 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to remain on the edge of possible bids to purchase and settle court fluctuations of his former leaders, the Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazars, the election of María Luisa Jorda as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes it the first woman to occupy a high office in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from polemics, as the enterprise continues to be immersed in a legal battle for the alleged transfer of over 230 million from the Sos to the Salazar brothers' companies.
In fact, it is not possible to shred the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new fund transfers
As far as Salazar credit is concerned, the former members of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) testified at the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they had approved a transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the option to exclude Paternina involved in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the exclusion of which Inversora Mer participates, against Federico Paternino on October 9.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorises this operation because it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that the "sufficient" content of the explanatory booklet submitted following the modifications introduced on 2 December is sufficient.
CNMV specified that the offer was directed to acquire 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which consists of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on exchanges in Madrid and Bilbau.
He further explained that 5.592.778 million shares were immobilised, which could not be transferred in any way until a tender was concluded, which it specified was priced by Federice Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New vehicle valuation tools
These days, storms and accidents not only make car service.
Each day thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are towed to a service, where the expert must estimate the damage and costs of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of parts and time of the workforce can be long and difficult work.
Calculate manually the repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this kind of system.
Service suppliers and solutions for the estimation of insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the ratings are conducted with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturer is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, the sales director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing continues to increase as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been listed in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
It is a very feverish work because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out for each model, where it is possible to "stitch" individual parts of tourist cars.
With regard to the massive sales model, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to the minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
They exceed 99% of the fleet in circulation.
Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) to perform the work of documenting and processing databases, each of which specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work at the same time with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but by country there are also tools to control spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
Considering the products Audatex offers, it is easy to get support that professionals in the sector can use.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, a standard solution for the valuation of insurance events intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the paint shop.
This tool shall be valid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it little, up to 10 times a month.
Then every insurance undertaking that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow full identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to disable vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying the tendency, carrying out geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a certain brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many have suffered serious insurance events over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of instrument.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices, and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a service supplier and solution of damage, accident or car maintenance
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in service, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and accounted for EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalizing office installations in Paris began.
Audatex was formed in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's resources, 62% of its brother is created in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The World Invoicing Group Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group cost $1,000 on the stock market, and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet base for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation assumed the subscription of €59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is solely for professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, sales of spare parts and professional vendors who must register prior to the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the major markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily advertisements, and about 100 new advertisements are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been disabled cannot be returned to service but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Wagons with historical value may be allowed to operate, although they were discarded, after preliminary proceedings.
Budget service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user will receive the budget in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation of the budget and generation of the budget.
Easy to use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals, who are more or less restrained when using new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired using the chassis number, a real graphic display of the model appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables as the cost of labour, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an instrument for valuation as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this workshop tool is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics welcome because it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it around to display the inside side.
