Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal a section within the framework of the amendment to the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the opposition leader Julija Tymoshenko was convicted.
At the second reading of the motion to alleviate penalties for economic delinquencies, Members rejected the adjustment that would open the way for the release of the imprisoned Examiner.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding a supposedly disadvantageous contract with Russia to purchase natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the appeals of the convicted are to be discussed by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the judgment as a political vendetta of the regime, suspicions of bias also prompted trial in the West.
The suggestion that section 365, on the basis of which the expremier was convicted, should fall out of the criminal code, supported 147 Members in the vote.
It took 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
The story of Libya's liberation, or Libya's rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winner remains to be defined.
As is customary in the county, Islamists will win the election, but it is about moderation or radicality.
The Transitional National Council has signed up for Sharia's custom law, and we already have an idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the hand is cut for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostasy from faith, and so on.
Instead of a person dictator, society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There'll be order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly wouldn't want.
However, our way of life is neither the only or objectively best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans in question for a change.
In fact, it's surprising that Islamic warriors have taken in gratitude by unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view, NATO's raids were not directed by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness was celebrated in every successful intervention.
Thus, when the winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We took part in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya is not militarily occupied.
Thus, the local problem of expelling the "crossmen" is eliminated.
But without occupying an oil company for a kiss of Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast the selfless protection of human rights.
Unless it's the Sharia law enforcement that's gonna spoil it for us.
A new era of crisis is about to begin.
France and the rest of Europe have reached the investor's spotlight
The statistical storm crossed Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated interquartally, Germany and France growing.
But today, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published forecasts of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP increased by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), while France stated that it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent yoy in this third quarter.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated on a quarterly basis, thus confirming the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance, according to the ČSÚ.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
Most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent year-on-year in this third quarter, but stagnated intermittently.
In the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally translated data, the German economy increased by 0.5 percent.
Both the euro area economy and the European Union grew 0.2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent yoy.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds grow to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields for Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
From Germany it is voiced that the ECB should be the lender of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate the advance for 200 million
Football representation has done the hardest job of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goal Petr Jiráček won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a big portion of luck in the second half, has saved a luxury lead from home retaliation and will not be missed at the European championship again.
IHNED.cz watched the follow-up match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
Czech representation also thanks to the domestic loss in the ending, the great Czech and hero Jiráček won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the advance to the European Championships.
Due to the precise defence of the Czech whole, the blackhorns did not get pressure until the second half.
The losers of the match became Damjanovich with Vucič, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech representation will not miss the European Championships next year, and a reward of about CZK 200 million will be added to the Czech football register.
There's been a lot of fighting football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hardly involved in the combination and were mainly played around the half line.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because long kicks for defence were precisely averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
In their gesture, they want to express support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the house at noon on Tuesday and then cried out the deaths of the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a live shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is being processed.
They thus show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) stated that Iran seemed to have failed to pursue a nuclear weapon.
The possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is spoken of in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then cried out the deaths of America and Israel.
In the case of an attack, the purpose of which would be to cripple Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press believes that besides the Isfahan Center, the target would also be the Natanz facility in which uranium is enriched.
Obese baby menu: does not eat and eat sausages
More than a third of children 9 to 13 years of age have weight problems, with overweight being 9 percent of schoolchildren and obese 5 percent of children.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Again, it shows how important it is to the healthy development of a person’s environment in which he grows and the patterns by which he is surrounded.
For example, sausages appear up to half more often on tables in obese children than in families with normal weight.
Fried fries had for dinner the day before the research related to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence of more than 19 percent obese.
In fat families, it is also not customary to play sports, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children replied that their parents will find time to move actively at least once a week.
A Survey Among 900 Children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity event is not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from the 4th to 8th grade have been involved in the project.
The proper eating and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obesity children.
"Only half of the polled said, for example, that they eat five times a day in breakfast-dinner-dinner-dinner mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition," one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no sausage at night
Experts point out that there are important and relative details for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast times.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was finding out that in a tenth of the households, there's no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
A questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are consumed more often in families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children polled regularly, the result was less than half - 15 percent for their parents.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own diets from the offered options according to their own tastes and their own opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
"The alarming is particularly popular with sweet lemonade," the final survey report states.
For lunch as a main dish, pasta just over the poultry won.
But the children practically didn't want legumes at all and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetables is low.
Adaptation to Health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"There has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition in a number of cases in the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the Obesity education lecture," the project results.
For example, it was notable for sweet lemonade, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children also checked the poultry and fish questionnaire more frequently as the main meal of the day and would limit sweet meals and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, asserting pros
In the opening article about how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was a lot at the opening hours.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures of three pros in the field, clothing of problematic characters and seminar on how it works on the set.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "footed".
This time, Principal Alice and I discussed (there is not a single guy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical character.
And the vast majority of them.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy figure with no proper curves, and someone's overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, extend neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We got tips like Jennifer Lopez's type of woman, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, the character nicely emphasized and at the same time don't dress too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is such that skirts or trousers really do not fit, then it is worth getting at least one such piece tailored.
You won't regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt, you will feel much better than in one that constantly shifts, sums up, stops in your waist and so on.
Again, a boy’s character can afford to wear clothes with lashes, applications, embroidery, or picking.
Of course, there are many such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information in my head.
And yet, I'm afraid that given the homework, it's too much.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to come up with two outfits: day and night.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style and type of character.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In the spirit of cheer, for me personally definitely better than such a Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about 100 kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or a young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of magazines or look up on the Internet and print and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is said, will also express our personal style and relation to graphic portrayal.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, such as handbag trends, coats, etc.).
This was told by stylist and designer Mario Kamenník.
But it's not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture was filled with information about the types of characters, and three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
So for example such shorts (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a shirt like a cloak, but you can also dress it on a bare body, put on shoes and take pictures like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But I most appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly to work."
"Then you can start violating them," James said.
Finally, I can see why we're crushing ourselves with all the instruction that we can combine with, what to do, why, even in fashion magazines, we sometimes see something else.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that stylists must have a lot more outfits than they can take.
So in a fashion story that has ten pages (then ten outfits), I have to be ready to "secret" at least fifteen.
And also that the picture of the outfit looks and works in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
That is what we must count on in creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed that the image and style does up to half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but image and marketing made her the world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to stylistic services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes find it useless (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look at it is second-rate).
And if someone is already getting styled from us, then we are very likely to be dictated by a completely different (smaller) size than they really are.
Then all we have to do is google and see if the tabloids had written about the celebrity's drowning/loss and so on.
Both Honza and Mario on Sunday put on our hearts that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In his work he mainly communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to guess people, not encourage, stand up for your opinion.
"When you're ordered by some executive to sort out her wardrobe and fill it up with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things to praise and recommend what they can be worn for," Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "powder", or bag on the set, must contain.
It's the one you turn on around your waist, and you have all the necessary proprietarys on you.
In addition to clear things, such as scissors, hair rollers or pin closures, there are also silon threads (with which a stylist helps in photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips by which we switch on the back of the clothes if larger (a pin or other clamp is not allowed, they would destroy clothes), or sewing.
In order not only to listen, but also to practically try something out, we learned how to properly succumb to shoes.
Even in a photo shoot in an studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the shoes with scissors so they don't accidentally get damaged.
So it takes real skill.
Mario pleased me when he commended my creation without reservation.
The skill mentioned is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It's becoming increasingly clear to me that engaging in professional styling really isn't a walk in a pink orchard, no matter what anyone says.
In Need for Speed: The Run is raced across America.
Review
Originally a carefree ride is transformed into a routine morning shift journey due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
Ambition was largely fulfilled, but it is of little use when no one apparently wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run raised high expectations before the release.
He promised that the old race series Need for Speed would once again move a bit in a new direction and from playable demonstrations he appeared as a game that might not be in the genre of action racing just to number.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages would end, in which the main hero would step out of the car and take place on foot.
However, as is the case with the NFS series, many are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series more or less for several years.
So it's not really mistakes, but it's a manifestation of the incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are inducted into a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal issues and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco, and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea carries several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One doesn't feel like the game's offering the same thing for a second.
Some of the environments are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a big deal.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seems visually very pleasant.
Moreover, from time to time, races are amplified by an uncharacteristic element.
In the desert, for example, you get involved in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you must be careful not to be buried by avalanches.
In addition, individual races are quite well placed in a row.
There's only a few types, but that's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the desired number of opponents (essentially classic race), then you catch up with time (classical fight with stopwatches) and then there is a duel waiting for you with only one opponent.
From time to time, the police will also get involved in this, which makes your efforts even more difficult.
New are passages outside the car.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack usually flees from someone and you have to help him by printing the right buttons at the right moment.
Nothing complicated.
They will surprise, however, that these passages are in play much less than you would expect (specifically perhaps even three).
In the end, however, it is for the benefit of the thing, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above mentioned, it ranks among the elements that arouse the game.
The ride model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
This means that these days it is certainly no longer anything, but it cannot be said that it is a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more active racing of the local riding model still suits quite well, even though we would be able to find a better one in the competition.
Until then, everything's perfectly all right.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer correct.
We do not expect this type of game to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave, then everything is probably not all right.
Typically, when you drive or pass cars in normal traffic, you sometimes lick each other lightly, but other times in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even attack.
The reboot system doesn't seem to be a big deal, but it'll make you feel better.
The reboots are designed so that if you break down or go far off the track, the game throws you back to the last clue point on the track.
Only five reboots are available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race all over again.
So it's more of a tool in case something goes wrong than if you could rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes reboots will not help, however, they will be solved by the need to learn a given section of the race by heart.
The big setback of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply can't fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the same location, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
It pisses off especially in situations where you can see how the opponent will easily pass between two opposing cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "counted" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
In all the time playing, you come across several places where you, again regardless of the time, always overtake the same opponent in the same place.
The most hits at the end of the game on a long bridge where you drive in the opposite direction.
The enemy must get there in front of you at any cost, apparently.
When you drive in front of you, you get a worse view of the opposing cars, so at first, you're probably going to have a couple of bumps.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenalineier, but the design is so obvious that it makes you reliably quickly disgusted.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes action enough that sometimes you literally can't watch where it flies.
And it doesn't really matter whether the concept of 50 unique tracks, the order of races, is responsible for it, so that boring doesn't stand a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the exchange of cars during races.
You have to watch out for gas stations near the roads, because that's where you can change the car, although in most cases, you'll get by with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong U.S. vehicles on straight highways and exotic supercars for technical riding, for example on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode it goes hand in hand and mode of challenges, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common for both challenges and story.
Various items are unlocked for gaining a higher level of driver: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for profile.
It is also linked to the online Autolog function, which compares your achievements with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard to understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you can reach the subway tunnel (but so), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (but so).
On the speedometer, the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (if so) flash, and there comes a train set from behind and uncompromisingly scrapes you.
In the editor's office, we will probably still have a few more days to talk about whether no one really gave a little thought when creating the game, or whether the authors think we're really that big an idiot.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and even great in a few cases.
It is so saddened that, in some tenser moments, the images are dropping, and in some cases quite tragically.
However, this concerns mainly accidents with a larger number of participants, when continuous scanning would not be of any use to you anyway.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category of "every dog different village" was created, but one can assume that because of listening to music, someone will probably not just buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run has been the best NFS work in years.
But this is how the game works undone.
I'm sure it's fun, but get ready for mistakes to blow your eyes with the power of airport spotlights.
The UK choirs will sing at the Velvet Students concert
The association of International Study Day celebrations and the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with musical experience has been offered by Festa Academica for the third time.
During it, he will present himself to twenty high school and college choirs.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for negatists and Eurosceptics
"Lisbon Treaty pretty significantly upsets balance between institutions".
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down a bit, and for all players to get used to their new roles," Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of the lecture, she has shown how much she takes her motto "Acceptably and openly about Europe" in such a clear and understandable way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the UK could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"First, there was a criticism that he was bland, that he was a gray clerk, that he couldn't perform any role, and I have to say that everyone was blown away, that he did the role well."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, communicate with them well, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in response to the question: "Who is this European Union? To which phone number should I call?", that is, as a major step towards unification and greater readability of Union policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban the gypsies.
Vicen has also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency described it as a success before last year.
The Czechs addressed the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The collapse of the government at this time then marked the Czech Republic as a major negative, which badly damaged the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the 'fact of frmol' was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being resolved today.
Moreover, a new seven-year budget of the Union still needs to be approved, which is greatly complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less, is all on the agenda for future negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: 'About Europe understandable'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, lingo that nobody understands.
How is a citizen supposed to understand that there are really no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of varying size or that someone really has to forbid us syretics.".
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
A Multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than positive aspects of the matter.
Moreover, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, if a Pole and a Hungarian comes to me and the Slovak comes to me, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what's your Visegrad Four?" and they don't look happy about it."
In the future, the Union, according to Vicen, is mainly faced with new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As very real, it perceives the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new 'European Federation'.
"We have euro area countries and non-euro area countries."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don't want to stand back."
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the whole Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
The IBM Innovator Begins the Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were looking for a word that most accurately conveys the IBM strategy, the closest thing they'd have to is "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the company's first boss, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already stamped the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" thus became an imprint around which the life of the future giant will depend (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began to be published in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her fundamental values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us during our first centuries to transform technology, business, and society.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director, on the anniversary.
Processed system
Watson in the 1930s treated his employees like the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had as one of the first American employees paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and an elaborate system to reward the best inventors and merchants.
The IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company was brilliant at extracting talent from the beginning - as one of the world's first firms, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana headed by IBM next year will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been active in IBM for thirty years, still holding the position of chief of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called yams, online brainstormings, many of which arise in future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there's enough ideas - almost half a million people work at the firm.
Institutions with a good name
Its strong internal and external image ensures a firm position in the business.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said Economist Professor Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for technology use," added George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as it is famously nicknamed because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest firms in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a disk.
IBM with roughly $220 billion this year became the second-largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when Microsoft outscored for the first time since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations hit customers' tastes and times - for example, IBM failed to place a bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally cling to the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they do not work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, the rival Microsoft, which essentially stands and falls on Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM's sales are mostly serviced, and after about a fifth, they are made up of software and hardware.
In 1990, he was the strongest hardware representative with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold few $15 billion worth of profitable assets, investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies during the same period.
Investments have continued since 2008 when the modern financial crisis swept through the world for the first time.
IBM acts on the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it appears that IBM has not been affected by the current crisis.
The IBM stock price has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, while the company's net profit has continuously increased.
The corporate password of IBM is to change everything but its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
History of IBM: From Cheese Slicer to Flight to Space
IBM (International Business Machines) was formed in New York a hundred years ago, originally having a complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken over only in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1880s, gave the basis to the later IBM.
They owned technologies such as famous "pointers," which means clocks recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new firm was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired rival company chief Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - an unbeatable corporate culture and identity is still built on Watson's ideas.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started producing and selling all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson was in charge of the firm, the turnover doubled to $9 million and the company's extensive expansion began to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after nearly forty years in the chief chair he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "basket," which established the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computers to Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully engage in advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, a "smarter planet".
Its aim is to use technologies smartly in unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban administration.
For the business area, the IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
She established her branch in Czechoslovakia as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe in 1932.
Today, in addition to IBM CR, the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno also operates here.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
Quicklist about an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you can keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rifle (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darin still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now he's not going to wait, and he's set clear rules for another life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová provided asylum to Bartosh in her home in the summer, she apparently did not dream of how her marriage would eventually end.
Despite Iveta's insistence after 30 days from Říčany moved away, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darin resigned, reconciled with her husband's relationship, and now she even gave him good-bye forever.
Rychytists don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
If Rychtář and Bartosha had broken up once after all, his wife's arms would not be open at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our house together, no one will cast him out."
"But she will live to see him, not as my beloved, straying old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," said Rychtářová, saying that she had already disengaged herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing his back door yet.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I won't change it."
"The wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"Company goes on, I handle repairs, garden, property, shopping."
"Darina and I are having a very normal conversation, except that we don't share our beds together," said Lightning Rifle.
If Rychtářová had found a new love, she said she wouldn't have stopped it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he's going with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Josef closed.
Worst female vices: Do they concern you?
When you ask the men if they could name any typical female vices, they usually all pour them out of their sleeves very quickly.
Dear women, will you get to know each other in the following lines, where there are several female vices that can perfectly pump the blood in men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like shopping and mass discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least temper their shopping passion a little.
But tell me, which one would resist walking around clothes stores, looking for well-fitting tops and then trying them all (ideally in different colors) in the stall?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a complete hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you outside...
Constant Discontent
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Right?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners complain about their looks all the time.
The stronger the sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Window washing, vacuuming, paving, dust cleaning, bath scrubbing - at least twice a week.
Are you accusing your partner of stepping on a dirty foot on a clean tile, children, that they soiled the scrubbed sink and took care of a glassed living wall with which you went to so much trouble polishing?
In case you suffer from this "perversion", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not stand first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your mutual relationship and family well - being.
Triggering
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
"You're gonna wear those old socks tomorrow too?"
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you poke your partner in this way several times a day, know that you can make a sure spin.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want everything to be all right.
Maybe if the men knew that, women wouldn't have to dig into them so much...
Stalking, gossiping
For some women, libels, gossip, insults, and conspiring against others are also their own.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Perhaps each of us will let loose some harmless little gossip or gossip.
Hand to heart, it's all women's own.
But the opposite is the gossip of the coarsest grains, which like and often gossip, perhaps despise everyone and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the framework of the women's working collective -.
Jagr and Voráček helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jagr participated in a Monday's NHL match with two assists in the Philadelphia 5:3 victory on the Carolina ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From an overview of the thirty-nine-year-old star, Claude Giroux benefited in both cases, who added one more pass and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assists in the match were recorded by Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the match, Jagr claimed to the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
"I told him before the game he'd give a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get such a feeling," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the first Flyers shot.
A while later, the team's second hit had a Czech track.
Voráček fought a disc behind Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the circles to scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break reduced in weakening domestic player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagre he scored a third goal, then his shot remelted flowing in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," appreciated Jagr of his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning," added Jagr.
Carolina still made the match a drama, with a goal by Tuoma Ruutua and again by Dwyer, who made his way out of a penalty shot, she made it unlike one wicket.
However, Matt Read did not allow further complications, which ended the renumbering of two to one.
"Excellently intervened in our Pronger band."
"He punctured the disc, I picked up the speed and (Read) drove to a more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference with the victory.
Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the match against Buffalo, in the second period he resigned due to injury in the upper body.
The Candiens lost a two-gun lead alongside the experienced bek and lost after a penalty shot of 2:3.
One of their raids did not transform Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than losing points, was saddened by an extensive back-row sickle, with the game being played by only five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters".
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The rotation was coming at us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moved the puck from our band."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty hits to Winnipeg winning 5:2 over Tampa Bay.
Five different shooters shared the Jets goals, who interrupted the five-game losing streak.
How prices of tours have developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agents at the time sold only tours to socialist bloc countries in the vast majority, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus travelled on vacation to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea near the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia as well, but then the Yugoslav regime inclined to the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually even within socialist countries.
If the citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union for example, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise the individual way was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered tours to the West at the time, but it was necessary to stand the line overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Still, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to raise funds (western currency) for the trip to the West.
By far, however, the Czechs mostly spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, resulting in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs acquired and this custom survives to this day.
Czech travel has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While the holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was our maximum until 1989, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the most popular Croatia until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia.
Immediately from the early 1990s, visa requirements were lifted to neighbouring western European countries, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits mainly from Austria’s Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for a while.
In Paris, for example, Czech tours slept in parks in tents, as our incomes at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech travel at this time was the carriage of their own food, cans, salamis, etc., to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally purchase the Western currency after many tens of years.
However, our standard of living and, with it, average salaries were rising, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare tours with charter flights since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper due to the possibility of arranging quantity discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had already had visa-free contact with virtually all developed countries of the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred right in 2000, when due to considerable demand he was sent from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to exotics, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm faraway countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit around 100,000 Czechs annually!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US cancelled visas for Czech tourists, thus definitely ranked our country among the world's most advanced countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and spent more than 15 thousand CZK per person for the first time in history for one foreign holiday, including the cost of a place of residence.
The General Assembly is to find the chairman, but again threatens to stand
Almost five months is Czech football without the chairman, and Ivan Hašek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) risks not being known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
For there is still no agreement on what electoral order will be followed.
Without it, the vote will not even start on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hasek resigned from office in June and, on his departure, called on colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hashko era, football slipped back to the skirmishes between the two union chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This became evident on September 16, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov for nothing, as the negotiations were blocked and it was not just a method of choice.
In fact, there was no consensus as to who actually has the right to vote at the meeting - whether only statutory representatives, or even full authority officials.
There has been partial agreement on this single point since, and the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law has also helped, according to which representation by virtue of authority is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
Nor did the executive committee, which in its deliberations, whether proper or extraordinary, have brought too much clarity to the situation, essentially resolves nothing else.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in Round 3 to rule out the possibility of heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the Association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, one of the candidates who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to go on a concession to win a candidate who will gain a higher sum of the percentage of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the superiority at this percentage.
"But that would then make sense of the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Party Svoboda, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the existing statutes.
Tomas Paclík agrees with this rather surprisingly, although it is estimated that the statutes of the designated electoral order are most suitable for Pelt of all candidates.
"I wish that the vote should be made as far as possible according to the statutes."
"In order not to make up any intercessive nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time, and in his observations he was mainly opposed to Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he believes that the new chairman will be known and believes that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passions will calm the possible progress of the national team today at the European Championships".
"Football will be on a happy wave again, more willingness to work together," says the Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very torn."
"It's not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations in a purposeful way."
"This may cause the General Assembly to be blocked again".
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality would be complete by the match.
The air special in which the vice-presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorice, i.e. he did not leave Prague due to a technical malfunction in the morning, looking for a replacement variant of how part of the executive committee to deliver the barage retaliation to the scene.
In the end, a ministerial meeting may be decisive, which may be held supposedly on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to force divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot in play: state subsidies, credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to fight for the chairman because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the head of football players of Pilsen Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have met all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have entered into the fight for top office.
"If a high-quality adept exists, I fight for it, and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the current situation, no such person has been found," said ČTK Paclík.
Until the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is driven by motivation to try to stop Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, in his way to the head of the FACR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he would only last in the role of chairman until 2013, when a proper general meeting is on the agenda.
In office, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too connected to football events.
"I've talked to some people who would come up with an idea."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is said to be most concerned about Pelt's connection with the chairman of the Plzeň Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the General Assembly.
For Paclík, it is so unacceptable for Pelta to stand in a presiding position.
"If he had won, the current condition would be preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football".
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a skilled businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also points out that Pelt's name was voiced years ago in a report in an investigation into a corruption affair, but from which Pelt came unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who, however, also takes his former statement seriously that he would "sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta became chairman".
If Paclík had triumphed on Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, considers.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the head of the representative."
"But he couldn't manage the association managerially."
"I don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who in September attracted much attention by standing behind the appeal of the judges' committee headed by Luděk Machela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says he'd dare to lead the association.
He refers to his abilities from managing private companies, and since last summer he has also been in charge of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the premier league triumph in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to his particular cultivation."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which goes to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not conceal his antipathy to, for example, Spartan chief Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities he would also consider strengthening the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new chairman should do."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say frankly where the money will go," he said.
As a liability now Paclík does not even take his connection to the Pilsen club, even though he himself claims that the chairman of the FACR should be "superpartisan".
Pelta is linked to Jablonec again, Rajchl to Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point in hypocritically transferring my shares to someone at the Pilsen Club and returning there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FACR that would rule out the electoral stalemate
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the event of an election, he would take a stand so that the FACR would have new statutes, which would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election struggle will significantly dampen the eventual success of the football representation today.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the representation and acquisition of finance in the event of the election.
He decided to go to the last minute before the last general meeting, so he could use a two-month delay to defend his fantasy of football management and present his ideas in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect to know the chairman on Thursday".
"He feels it's high time for someone to run the association," means a man who is primarily associated with the Apple Club, but who has served in Sparta and the executive committee of the union for many years.
He therefore believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that behind the current problems with the choice is the euphoria that reigned during Ivan Hasek's reign.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they don't allow different interpretations, we've had a chairman since September," Pelt pointed out.
Just reworking the most important document of the civic association took the delegates as a decoy.
"If I become chairman, I will take this as a personal task and I am willing to shoulder personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principle thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
They say they continue to try not to define against their rivals.
He has previously announced that he can imagine working with Henry Rajchle, whom he acknowledges because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for long, who left the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's gained some success."
"His attacks, however, were undignified and a lot of people surprised in the way of the election campaign".
"That is why many of them now doubt his true character," he said at the opponent's address Pelt, who is said to remain loyal to the proclamations he announced as early as September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to representation.
That should be the football window window.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians case or the resounding of last year's corruption scandal."
"Then I would rush to a meeting with both the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the entire football," said ČTK's 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised back then that his coming to the head of football would mean no personnel purges.
"I would first have to get acquainted with the content of individual employees," Strahov said, where there is understandable nervousness from the long absence of control.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming general meeting, they believe that on Thursday, delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If the only questionable point is how to vote in the third round, then we can move on."
"Football needs credibility, and it only gets it by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains an optimist two days before perhaps the decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that under him the FACR would start working hard
If the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic were elected to the Thursday general meeting by the current Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the Association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants to push through systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by previous chairman Ivan Hasek.
"As chairman, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth".
"But I'm not saying I'd do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute competence on the Executive Committee so that each of the members can devote himself to a particular area."
"And I will give out hard tasks to move football a mile forward in every segment."
"Many people would probably not be happy about this because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will keep throwing sticks under my feet and questioning my every move," he explained.
"Many people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also said to be motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hasek.
"A lot of work has been done in two years, and I don't want to throw it away right now."
"There are started processes that will have a revitalization in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, worried that if another candidate was elected Miroslav Pelta, the situation at the union might return to the time before Hasek.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him, above all, there are people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for taking sides."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl noted.
He also refutes the claim that he would be just a Czech chairman.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the Second League would split into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the First League."
"There would not be a current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík also took part in the fight for the President, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President and sees that there are clear achievements behind me," said Rajchl, who considers his achievements to be saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the contrary, he blames himself for the fact that the union is not pulling together.
While claiming Pelt to be "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", he considers the other of Paclík's rivals to be a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he had been elected, he would have continued the things Ivan Hasek had started here and would not fundamentally have changed the staffing of the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," Rajchl says.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Swimming Pools
The Blue Jump
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from the perspective of the UFO, a luxury swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after visiting cities or travelling let his tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where wellness is most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder went on discovery trips in the past one and a half years, she could not miss her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she looked up to the height of the artistically shaped domes, swimming opposite the marble putti (a figure of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) who waited for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pool.
If she liked any of the swimming pool, she brought it to her notebook in no time - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and are now presented in his recently published book "Badefreuden (Radost from Swimming) ": Folk swimming pools in Munich, the historical palace of swimming pools in Schwarzwald,"The Hard Core of Concrete Structures" in Taunus.
It was led by 13 countries by its "Town for the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for the Plovna culture.
With sports it's not too much, says Meder - only in the water it's something else.
To anger it is only that fans of swimming must settle for blue tiles and chlorine smell, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly", says Mrs Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the Jumping Pool and ethereal oils for the sauna - the comfort factor is therefore so great that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real sighting: "Instead of the floor, a man has a water surface in the spa."
"It is both transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, varied tiles, jumper boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (Boasts from Swimming) " provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis wellnes - but primarily encourages the desire to jump into blue.
Distinguished specimens were discovered by Mrs. Meder in her search for Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Spa in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful spectacle. While one has a whole town in the outdoor pool of the spa in St. Anton can watch the snow covered by Arlberg - and: In the steam baths there is a window from which it is possible to watch the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Ötztal Aquapark looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three ups of the open pans in the winter, steam rises while the background of the Ötztal mountain rises to the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool was raised by the pool collector Mrs. Meder's smell of chlorine to the nostrils.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpáda Spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells like heating oil to the point where one hardly believes that one has reached the healing baths.
The odor comes from healing water containing alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits cling to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic bath Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovic designed the spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the massive growth of weeds between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood up for the demise at the magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already had three stages of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanian elements that come from the time of their inception in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa site of the pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because she comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some performance to combine such diverse construction styles into such a beautiful complex", says Mrs. Meder.
At a palace like this, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank lets the commodity trade check
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its agricultural raw materials business?
According to information, SPIEGEL-ONLINE commissioned Josef Ackermann to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the group's boss wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear to the federal citizens: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand Deutsche Bank and the other credit institutions to step out of this business because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa poll under the authority of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets at global commodity markets drive prices to height, and the banks are thus complicit in the world's hunger problem.
Consumer Protection Campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, although large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley also act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with interest in high-risk business have broken away from supply and demand - and have made profits on account of the poorest.
Otherwise than competitors in the United States responded to the criticism of Ackermann: He promised to examine the objections and said that no trade "is worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank bet".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE's information, the international working group controls complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The inspection is to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to handle it.
At the end of January, the bank’s representatives then want to tell what the consequences will be.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working with his own help on his image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time increased his criticism of the financial sector: "Bet on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are today harming the general welfare."
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, do his duty.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items for which money is used for food price bets", Bode said.
"Lusty whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with hunger suffering people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before his retirement from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors would not go to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - his successor should eventually deal with that.
Every other person would testify to investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
Up to now, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is precisely 11 percent that Deutsche Bank considers it legitimate that it offers investments with which food prices are staked.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: Each other would testify as a result of the poll to all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said that they would consider shutting down their account and going to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
Removal pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy ending: The Austrian Pavilion from the 1958 World Exhibition won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When it grows for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a fitting and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was then received by the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and protracted construction of steel and glass.
The construction is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous by also building the pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key carried out by a side construction in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous 1973.
Its temporary exhibition building was designed by the pavilion after the world exhibition in Schweizer Garten near Vienna's Südbahnhof (South Railway Station), renovated and opened in 1962 by the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
Still, it was used until contemporary art had a new stand in Vienna.
As of 2001, the building was empty and decayed more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz reconstructed the pavilion, now bearing the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as Museum of Contemporary Art.
Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which 2007 became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery, was established.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, i.e. in her youth figure skater, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's museum and as the founding director of the Museo Modern Salzburg, strongly promoted reconstruction with politicians and memorialists, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined use.
In addition to contemporary art, works by sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by an eponymous foundation, a cafe and a bookstore should be established, and an office building must be built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
To perform, Krischanitz was then the ideal cast.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau structure of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the University of Technology in Vienna at Schwanzer, and the pavilion was "an extremely important place" to him, at which he "almost every weekend" viewed the exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness in its relocation to Vienna and the change of use.
In the present reconstruction, there were much bigger problems: The building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
Glass facade windows profiles were replaced, glass fibres reinforced insulation glass and glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings remediated.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street providing lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lavish Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door remained preserved, the building is painted in an old anticorrosive red-brown color tone.
And the theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument office and the low budget.
"Often there had to be found material that is good and cheap and also liked the conservation office", says Krischanitz and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said to be difficult with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical "drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is said to stand "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "build up proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, as an urban lucky coincidence happened: In the area around Schweizer Garten there is a completely newly designed "City District near Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps another happy coincidence will arise: the 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as we can hear it, is already negotiating with the city a neighborhood at a post in Schweizer Garten.
The runway plans a package for a million-dollar winter crisis
The runway set up a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter period.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against cold caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn spends more than 70 million euros in newspapers this year.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report, referring to the internal group plan, saying that total investments of around EUR 300 million are expected to be made by 2015.
It is said that better use of trains and rail networks should be achieved under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, a doubling of the number of internal and external staff is planned to 16,000 people for snow removal on railway installations and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the required switches within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube's chief of railways warned of train failures and delays during this winter after meeting at the highest level with government and industry officials.
In the last winter period, passenger transport had considerable problems, because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition to this, delays in ICE freight trains
For years, the runway has also been unable to handle the fact that ICE trains must be repaired more often to have the workshop checked when one ICE train at Köln Central Station experienced destruction of the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the US
After the uproar about Chief Josef Ackermann, there are new tramples in the US: Deutsche Bank must pay a million in damages there.
As if the Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, it caught up with a giant in the field yet his past in the US: Frankfurt's institution pays $145 million in one compensatory procedure (106 million euro) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage sheets.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator blames a number of large banks for misleading cooperative banks with false promises to purchase financial products; that they have probably reduced the risks.
Such papers have lost considerable value during the crisis and have torn banks down with them.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the topic without the need to drag the parties to court", said Deutsche Bank's spokesperson in New York City.
The bank admits no guilt by settling.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the accommodation of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is trying to get compensation for the billion-dollar damage incurred.
Now completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped on other large banks and in the summer sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The questionable mortgage sheets are called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. housing bubble collapsed in 2007, it became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although events occurred a few years ago, the banks are now blowing sharp winds in their mouths.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits in order to achieve redress or affect misconduct.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
He criticizes 18 international large banks that two state-owned U.S. real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have put about $200 billion worth of mortgage deals at a disadvantage.
Deutsche Bank must also face the FHFA lawsuit, which includes more deals worth about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without stating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requirements as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion dollars
Financial Guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT business.
As of March, he purchased more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, major American investor Warren Buffett has always claimed that he will not invest in IT and computers because the long-term development of companies is only difficult to predict.
However, he now read the IBM business reports and changed his mind about investment in the industry.
He had already had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for IT-department of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered knighting in the financial world.
As a result, the mother rock of IT IBM may now be called "Sir IBM".
For Buffett revealed at the US economic radio station CNBC that he had purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became thus one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett sagte that even IBM had not yet known anything about his engagement.
He praised management, which sought even good returns during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT-services for a long time, such as the operation of computing centers.
More than a 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has been avoiding technology firms to this day.
He argues that he invests only in enterprises whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, lubricant manufacturers or machine products.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns alongside about 80 of its own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large-scale coca-cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old master took over Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a iconic figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha (The Miracle of Omaha".
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's shares rose by one percent before the stock market started.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of over $220 billion on the stock market and is regarded together with Apple and Microsoft as the world's most valuable technology enterprises.
At Microsoft, so many Buffetts, he wouldn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his confidential friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Bunny in Zwickau", Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a "blood ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was responded to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, this brings back a ghost long thought to be dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
There was never any doubt that there was xenophobia in Germany.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals an extent that can no longer be supervised.
"Is Blood Ideology Reliving Again?" were the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the "Sabah" newspaper emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a secret police agent for the Constitutional Protection Department, and fears that German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany responded discreetly: It recalled this weekend with a demonstration of silence outside the Brandenburg Gate of victims of racist violence.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, remembered a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Recruitment Agreement.
In cheerful colours, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
The news coverage of several Turkish media works here: "Gift of Germany to 50" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany will not be taken to make this thought connection.
"It's starting to smell", sounds the column title from Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes were murdered and made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany with their work.
The most critical is discussed in the German Internet forums by the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
This is how many show up rhetorically to use drastic means: "If action continues so superficially, immigrants will be left with nothing but their own defence and armed".
"That'll be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and proportionality of punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on internal peace in Germany", writes Selen.
What it means if internal peace is threatened in Germany, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the burn site in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
However, the assassinations made the Turk side more evident in the feeling of reciprocity.
Do not repeat past mistakes
In the Turkish press at that time, the failure of German politics after the assassinations was primarily criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a sympathetic telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the funeral ceremony in Köln in his speech.
Quite as if the value of a man was measured by the height of his taxes.
The current news coverage of Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local state-rights arrangement is.
In addition to efforts to make extensive clarifications and a new assessment of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
The Scandal Bank at Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now some German's supposed to straighten it out.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, he became known in July to enter 2013 into almost the same spectacular new employment: the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS Swiss Grand Bank - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praising Switzerland whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidarity and saying friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS achieved turnover".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But it was clear in September that everything would turn out completely differently.
A UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and wasted around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Board of Directors Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland the respected banker, had to leave.
The president of the UBS Board has since been as sunburned as well - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the Board of Directors as early as May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough on Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
He then assumes responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just proven once again that he deserves the title "Bank of the Greatest scandals in Europe"
For UBS is both huge - until recently the world's largest property administrator - and it has been slipping for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, will remain spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had enjoyed excellent reputations.
An image of a silent and solid, but also a cunning asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus she managed UBS 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it advanced to the league of the largest banks in the world
That made an impression.
Former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "I always listed my students at the time UBS as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I have been so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who was still considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division wasted Subprime-paper and had to write off billions.
To withstand this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
However, it has found really investors, but such as would have recently been upheld by the nose: the Opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first impact.
In April 2008, things were getting worse.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, disaster ensued: UBS stood by its misinvestments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank purchased from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on a mandatory exchangeable bond for which it could have become a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture).
"We could not save UBS again", says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS has been capitulating in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to issue data to wealthy customers who, if possible with the help of banks, have cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - to recover unauthorized profits from these shops, including a fine premium.
By doing so, UBS confessed more or less openly that it helped tax cutbacks.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in a rich client contest: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss bank secrets were no longer what they used to be.
The resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board ensued.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over a period of several months: in investment banking due to poor speculation and asset management to assist in tax reduction.
And just as it calmed down again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business anabase: The only dealer had wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: with investment banking risk management, it's probably still not working out.
"Adoboli may have found that risk control has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Zürich University Bank Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also sure: "UBS's problem is that he can't handle risk control."
After all, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers stepped up a long time ago to become guardians of the great property of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - also on this side, the Alpine Republic has once again collapsed.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprungli for high-quality chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich are still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The position is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters in the Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which runs directly to the Lake of Zurich, which is framed by snow-covered peaks of the Swiss Mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, business rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery such as Tiffany's can be found here among the Swiss traditional shops such as Sprüngli's Confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside there are walls covered with marble, in front of them stands massive leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large directional sign to the "seiff".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
However, the idea of the Swiss Bank was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He would rather not read his name in the papers, eventually closing business with both large banks, like all Swiss bankers.
UBS has probably grown too much, finding - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything else to say.
"And if they had, they would have adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS's profits at first, and then the disaster: No European financial institute lost as much money in the jungle as Schweizer Großbank did.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, a government coalition of a small seven-million-dollar country came to its nation's greatest rescue event", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save the bankruptcy of a standing large bank.
How could this happen?
If they're talking to Swiss bankers, they see a problem in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks merged into a massive group.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for small Switzerland in the merger - and was still growing.
In doing so, it helped that both different bank predecessors of UBS were complementary: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a center of gravity in property management and poorer, but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money, with which they could spin the big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 head of the UBS Group and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of the future", says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a person guided by feelings around the stomach, who has developed completely from banking science."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli towards the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "I guess he thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The obvious thing is, pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall meetings of executives, at which group chief Wuffli repeated the same password again and again: To knock Goldman Sachs off the throne down.
The US Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It stated "League Tables", a waiting list that documents the success of banks of that time.
In it, she tried UBS' location at the top.
She's already made it a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she participated in the game at the top.
However, the business advisors who have been assigned stress one weakness: In international interest trade, in the talk of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a large distance behind the largest banks.
UBS may have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS committed itself to an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its based fund have invested to hedge risks in US investment Subprime.
It developed into a massive machine that converted securities into US mortgage loans and passed on - but it also retained risks itself.
Also, when other banks long ago were looking for a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there", says bank expert Geiger.
How great is the euphoria and the deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean were more difficult than thought.
The UBS positions have become an ejecting seat and to this day they are swinging.
Who runs a big bank now has almost impossible work.
He must find a strategy for the bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
The bank expert Geiger has an idea: No more investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is supposed to go down heavily, so much is clear now.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually only understood as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he asserted: He is to run UBS business in the long term, announced by the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to business in the mid-1990s.
3,500 places to cross off.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But so far he is only publicly saying that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe is heavy on the U.S. stock exchange.
The threatening recession in Europe has stripped American investors of the courage to start the week.

This tuned investors in the US skeptically. "We are not an island, but an addict," said Steve Goldman from Goldman management.
Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: he said in one CNBC-interview that it would probably not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That is probably why it is too early, from his point of view, to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left a few decades old principle and joined the American technology industry.

Intelligent Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, ravens of the field are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been in the picture of the city for centuries, yet in some communities complaints about dirt and noise caused by animals are piling up.
Yet there is no means against the "problem birds" in sight.
The ravens of the field may no longer be evicted from the cities, experts at the first symposium on crows in East African Leer.
There, experts from all over the Federal territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for Alternatives in Cities
The conservationists also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected ravens of the field: The use of chemistry in agriculture may increasingly destroy traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing construction, and felling of typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting couples are among others in the Westphal Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz, and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, the 2005 disputed project of mass killing crows in the rural district sparked negative headlines.
Critics have labeled animal capture into bird traps and killing sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, timidity, nothing brings", so much learned by urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or felling trees often has adverse consequences, also said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies break down and divide into other places".
Shouting is conceivable only as an exception for hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle in other places is conceivable.
"Information boards instead of chain saws", on the other hand, was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens due to a completely different treatment of animals: "One carbon in the face we can ultimately best survive with self-confidence."
Mrs Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's educational crow trail, on which the information boards provide information on the life of a highly intelligent raven field.
The project is said to have been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Ravens of the field do not only use the aid to achieve a treat, but even make their tool as an aid.
Researchers from Cambridge University recently tested behavior on four ravens of the field as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that stones must induce structural collapse to reach the pier larvae.
Without much training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the shrewd crows then had to solve a more writhing problem.
In a vertical cylinder, researchers placed a tiny container with a moth larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
Of these, she shaped all four animals a hook, using it as a pointer to hunt from the pipe the container behind the handle.
Three of the four field ravens did it even with a stunt.

The hope of Bosnians and Turks did not work out for the cup.

Former Wolfsbur player from England at the head of the table standing club Manchester City settled the ball with a header on the lower edge of the bridge, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic

After the intervention against Helder Postig in Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36).
At the counterparty, Stark performed a disputed penalty kick after action Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic changed with certainty.
But after the break, the European Vice-Chief of 2004 cleared everything up with four shots.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended his final doubts in the 81st minute.
With this he leaves the Champion of Europe from 1976 for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
Michal Bilk's team with the Legionnaire of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the beginning.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech prevented reflexively at the last moment possible own goal by Tomáš Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its biggest options when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired at the 40th minute from the speed from the border of the criminal territory just around Chekhov's wicket.
After the break, the crossbow had to save the place of the already knocked down goalkeeper of the Czechs of the world class, again reducing the attacker FC Soul (50.).
The gate finally cleared everything up shortly before the conclusion.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that point.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to relax his seat on the third bench during the 2002 World Cup, Croats may rejoice in their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championships.

Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance only a rod, striker Kazim also could not bounce the ball in the wicket.
After this terrible second, Croatia took control increasingly.
Also, after the Croats were interrupted, they did not receive a wicket.

Konstantin Vassilev (57.) equalized for guests.
Ireland set the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute until Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that Estonian defense prevented a possible lead wicket.

Massacre at a personal level
An emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund called Beauty and Grief: The Confidential History of World War I (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of performing characters until your head spins.
One piece of advice on how to act at that moment: Carefully tear this page out and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know everyone in the novel narrative of Mr. Englund very well and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a lighthouse - at times when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite aptly, as an "antihistorical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, almost lacking ambassadors, energetic journalists, and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened as the author explains, rather than "a book about what it was like". It mainly deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and grief" combines war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives are blended like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the entanglement of fate, while others are extinguishing.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classic historical novels.
It corrects the idea that World War I was just about the terrifying trenches on the West Front.
"Beauty and grief" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: Alps, Balkans, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with bee nests falling on them, must spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or struggle with the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning, it is a very moving reading.
War consumes people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts to sound in the distance, and you're the woman who's home with your children, run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the entire war was unleashed.
"Vakuum arising from lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumours."
"Beauty and Grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from résumés, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound both frightening and engaging, but thanks to the integration of tiny moments and details they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them deal with suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Counters, everywhere, all substitutes."
"Coffete substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "mass made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, boots with wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds internal impulses for savagery and brutality, then declares of war: "In the end you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books, and pretend that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarian hiding behind the starched self inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When you finally accept sacrifice, you would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like "a convict he secretly hangs".
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"Conflict became increasingly economic competition and competition," Mr Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress who performs his bloodshed without rising from the table."
People act completely unexpectedly, the vice alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the gonocok pus trade, which soldiers bought and wiped out their genitals in the hope of ending up in a hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate of them would rub it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose is brisk, but not flamboyant, which is a great fit for his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way the war "extremely unmanageable forces have unleashed: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly rather than complex narrative worked with hints, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "On the Western Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending that is unprecedented in popularly learned literature.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, tore the page from your list of heroes out of your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute exactly scheduled raid
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was elected because by that time the Zuccoti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except for a few senior officers. The others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation, was at the forefront of the event.
They were not allowed to repeat cases from recent weeks, when, for example, pepper sprays were used against protesters, thereby violating department rules and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy spilled over the side of squatters.
That is why the police operation, aimed at cleaning Zuccotti Park from protesters, was initiated only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by operations conducted in other cities.
A massive behavioral exercise in crisis situations took place in the part of Randalls Island, which was preparing for the event at Zuccotti Park.
The leaders intensified the so-called riot control training - anti-terrorist measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" by someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "training".
"I know a few police officers who have also been called into this event, and no one has said to them that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said a person who has only spoken on the condition that they remain anonymous.
"Zuccotti Park was known to only top members of the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was a lesson that the city had already received once.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean up the park, but then retreated from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the operation began.
The Tuesday event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with a higher level of crime.
Mr Kelly explained that a large number of people were coming and going during the day, so one hour at night was the ideal time to launch the event.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive streets, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
Lights and a recorded message roaring from amplions have spooked many protesters.
When the members of the order units entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack their things.
Other police teams have been spotted gathering on the edge of the park so that they can enter it if any arrests are needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesperson for the police department Paul J. Browne claimed that this was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to stop them from seeing their troops in action, plus some police officers were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that TV cars on Church Street leading along the western park border could easily film.
Police were moving in the west direction, entangled with the dense confusion of the protesters’ personal items, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the sanitary department, which immediately rallied everything left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting image materials appeared shortly afterwards on the internet.
The most certain group of protesters resorted to the vicinity of the kitchen in their campground, which lay near the center of the park.
Some have created a roadblock, and police have initiated their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp were handcuffed to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 a.m. there were no arrests in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, sounded the police's statement.
Mr. Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most arrests were made due to "organization of riots and resistance in arrest," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene of the event was Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of Police Department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives in the department.
Mr Kelly was present, but "did not participate in the operation's management," said Mr Browne.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to summon her.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were erected.
From these places, police then developed a protective belt even further from Zuccoti Park.
In one place, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields as they push people even further beyond that border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. a protester south of Pine Street was spotted as he jumped on the hood of a police car, and several others who were venting air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
The Auxiliary Union will sue the city for dismissal
Labor unions representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were not necessary and that there was discrimination due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
Judicial dispute is probably the last option left for the District Council 37 trade unions in their efforts to reverse the decision to dismiss.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators, and other employees who were among the worst-paid employees of the city, lost their jobs. Their dismissal was described by union leaders as payback by the city for not allowing him access to the health care fund managed by the labor squads last spring, using which the city wanted to seal a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically rejected the charge.
At the meeting of the City Council held last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissal was part of a budget approved in June.
One of the board members immediately countered by the fact that there was no specific talk in the budget about the release of auxiliary workers.
The representatives of the District Council 37 have announced that they have already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they will sue him. On Wednesday they will call a press conference to formally announce the lawsuit at the Manhattan Supreme State Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight laid-off workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the city's legal department, said that the city has not yet seen the lawsuit, so it will not comment on individual charges.
According to the New York Times draft complaint, the unions focused on the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city, thereby trying to support their claims about unfair conduct, as they hold that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island did not release at all and in Upper East Side at least, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and in District 8 and 9 parts in the South Bronx even 46 assistants were released.
He recalls that at the Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, despite being a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty.
Public School's 36 school budget was reduced by 3.26% this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus finances for each enrolled poor student.
The unions argue, among other things, that high school directors may have been confused by the way in which a document authorising the dismissal of parent coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although that word is much more often used to describe the school's transfer from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," it says in the complaint proposal, "and not merely moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept a deal on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something regarding the uprising in Libya.
Before this happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, the long-term reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of the United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Commission on International Relations will decide on a statement supported by Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and American troops for "stratecy".
"With this statement we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both parties of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts".
The said sentences may seem innocent, but no debate that concerned Libya has been easy until now.
During the summer, legislators from both sides constantly argued with the White House about the wording of a series of statements for approval or, on the contrary, the rejection of the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the funding of US operations in Libya.
Thus, the US mission in Libya found itself literally in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama is running the mission, but it obviously did not irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The weightiness of Congress eventually preceded other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August, and he was killed by Gaddafi on October 20.
The Nato mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
In its statement, the Commission on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity that they have spent in an effort to liberate their people" and "praising both the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population, for extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be divided into two halves again, as was the case with the approval of the June proposal?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), head representative of the Republican Party on the commission, opposed the latest version.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution concerning the budget or other subject on which the whole House or Senate will vote.
Other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself, despite considerable efforts.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution, which were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal presented to both the House and the Senate - and others are just minor alterations of others.
Only in the House can there be found at least 15 versions of the balance budget amendment and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
While some of the proposals are identical, their supporters - especially emerging Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authorship".
The revenue on budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss limiting the number of periods in which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in office as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of additions that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages and an amendment prohibiting the burning of a state flag.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be annulled if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in designing various additions, however, they are not significantly out of average compared to previous years.
In 111th Congress they offered 77 additions, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales compared to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment, which was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Battered but not defeated," says Gifford in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after being injured by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, she sang along with a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and stated that more than returning to Congress she wanted to recover.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" at ABC News Station with Diane Sawyer. It was obvious that she was still having trouble making sentences and needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to a bullet wound that pierced her skull in the front, penetrated her left half of her brain and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, smiled and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long episode of "20/20" that was aired on the eve of the release of this couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The special followed the entire recovery of Gifford since the shooting of January 8.
The videos Kelly made during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than lift one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and taught by therapists how to perform simple activities.
Nodding your head.
Lip pout.
And then, her first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast" when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in the recovery of Giffords: Congresswoman sings on them along with therapist on the tunes to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that she did not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford was reading newspaper articles about the shooting on March 12, when she first asked him who the six were who was killed in the incident.
The shooting involves a suspect named Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison under the influence of violently administered drugs, awaiting trial.
"Many people died," she told Giffords Sawyer.
"Dreadful, terrible, terrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife stated during the recovery, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you can do it, you can pull yourself together and come back even stronger than ever."
Military troops encounter compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, aviators, and marines ran past him.
The festively dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who held the spring fundraiser.
Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military forces somewhat differently, was also present at the ceremony.
"They were all introduced as orphans," wrote the officer in the e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect, it was regret.
Such completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is impregnablely included in praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise costs something, the soldiers say.
The public increasingly behaves as if the individual in uniform regrets.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that once returned troops from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken quietly and privately among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat events where they served as Marine Corps members, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their ministry from two angles.
From the perspective of some, he will feel respect and amazement because they defeated enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But others will wonder if "an evil, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took a place in Washington in government after returning.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him inconspicuously indicated whether he could resist the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
"If you talk about your ministry, you must count on negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The disquieting army partly stems from America's indifference to wars.
Success on the battlefield rarely reaps recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army, and finds little self-interest in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer respect military heroism as was common during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to hit hard against rape
This week, it will decide whether 28 women and men's trials against the military will be initiated due to alleged inactivity in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to file a lawsuit.
Private class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was 11 weeks pregnant on the night she was reportedly raped by her military colleague.
It happened in October 2008 and she was headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box with 12 beers.
He asked her if he could join her, that they could have a little drink in her room.
"My head turned on a warning light," Lyman described.
But a native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they walked into her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict of a hearing that could have a historical impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in fighting the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington's lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military and that the military failed to investigate, punish and any pursuit of justice after announcing these attacks.
Burke says she's going after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to impose measures against such acts? High Command."
Burke also claims that as of February, she contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - she stacked all the eggs into one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if it is necessary not to let the pressure go.
The Defense Department's team is led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his co-workers, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek discuss in detail the defense strategy - in principle, the issue is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Alleged injuries concern military service of defendants," the document states.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950 ’ s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a matter of wordplay: it is hard to find a clear front line in modern wars.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly significant role, especially in communication with civilian women occurring in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell between these wars - two thirds of them in combat.
The time has come for modernisation in the military, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, except for her, three other attorneys deal with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit for four major military academys for the supposed development of an atmosphere supporting hatred of women.
Independently, the nonprofit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for its anti-military lawsuit. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personal misconduct", which was reported to have been found in rape victims to have an excuse for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, belonging to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, it is a very common practice.
Her group filed an action against the state veterans' organisation in December, which she accused of discriminatory practices that were to take place in the processing of requests for assistance by persons claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the ministry.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties, proposing a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for Preventing and Solveing Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains unreported in most cases, and according to Pentagon estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In a report released in March, the rate of prosecution of suspects is also discussed: in 2010 20 percent of the cases reported in the military - which is half as opposed to the civilian justice system.
In the case of Deputy Burke, prosecutors describe the attacks only as the first of a number of traumas.
Private First Class Lyman, for example, reported alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was due to occur.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to eleven times different police members, doctors, and commanders.
She took all the tests necessary to determine rape, and in her bed, the blood of the assailant was found - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which questions were asked about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses to the reputation in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the sentence was passed," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there at the scene - I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"I was placed on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his trial.
Lymans ordered her to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality disorder, thus calling her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to service.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors moves to the next stage or not, it is a long run, says John Turley, law professor at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of negotiations."
But there is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since the first moment she saw the light of the world.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because their duties do not give due respect to the same level of motivational stimuli and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
The only way to change is if good people are willing to fight.
If not decided in a hearing in their favour, Burkevoá, a defendant's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a lawsuit and begin working on other cases relating to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue, from which there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
The Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Explore You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just go on Facebook.
"We realized that finding them is not really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently released news from the British research team, which concerned European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says that it was enough for scientists to simply use the advertising on the site and, thanks to this, they determined with complete accuracy the demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team across Europe found half a million right-wing group fans, then focused attention on them and sent them ads. However, instead of inviting them to the newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they invited them to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about their level of education, their relation to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from over 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are disgusted by the increasing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
DEMOS team work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends that hide state updates, wall contributions and pressed "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data on average each day, making this social network literally "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new researches. The number of academic works in whose name the word Facebook occurs has risen to almost 800% compared to the state five years ago.
For some scientists, the Facebook spell lies in giving them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them somewhere on the street.
"Formerly, when you wanted to do a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where they'd never let you go" Bartlett says.
"All this Facebook is breaking down - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken outputs on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moren suggests that peers of students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you can't diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children we would otherwise not have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The site's information team has developed statistics on relations status and Valentine's Day, voting participation in 2010 and the nation's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information to the site.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules regarding how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users thought scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it as being information between them and their friends."
Subsequently, the question of methodology is also considered.
Even with off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is absolutely sincere.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
"When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to plotting two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter of the "defence".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," he stated in court, where 500 people gathered.
"I raise an objection against the Court of Justice because you have been given a mandate by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I admit no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him the prepared speech, to address relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, to ban him from having any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and to announce that the competent authorities would have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he was kept tightly locked up.
They all took part in moving the case to an early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors told NRK commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved mentally a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and leaving the building without any difficulty looking at present journalists and survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge admitted that he was not mad, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any complicity.
Some may find it comforting that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I would like her to fall out like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, everything would be so much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie headed to cinemas this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge and elected him as his genius, the greatest modern inventor.
In the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted for a special film heading to the cinemas this week, it will be a fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind understood perfectly the business processes and working flows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and person who matches every little thing to the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work...[but] between an excellent idea and an excellent resultant product is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour-long interview took place.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and he eagerly watched as the general public accepted the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's entire interview was used on the TV show, and original copies of the interviews were reported to have been lost in transport.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly cut, forms the basis of a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which heads to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also appears to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thought, when it can be seen that Jobs is perfectly considering the answer to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when Cringel’s questions make him impatient and move him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was shot even before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and it features frighteningly prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but on Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the bloom of his genius, is something raw and inspirational.
He has here his own vision of how things could and should look.
It did not take long for him to put his thoughts into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which are definitely worth noticing:
How did he learn to run the business:
"During years of business, I always asked, "Why do you do this?" and the answer was always the same: Well, that's just how you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business matters.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounts.
He was completely confused about the way costs were recorded - they often started with the sign "standard costs", they could only be imagined. At that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs within a moment.
As he did a ruse on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
A number of things have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
It tells of how Wozniak and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and, during the call, they got transferred from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times, we've been going round the world like this, so when we shouted something on a pay phone, it came back a minute later from the other phone at the door," laughs Jobs.
"We were young and found ourselves able to build a thing that is capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars worldwide."
We made ourselves a tiny little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I think Apple would never have existed without it.
Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, making the best of themselves as Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called on to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they had summoned the pope himself to the phone, the couple trembled and put the earpiece down.
How he fell in love with technology (and telephoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and was looking for spare parts to build a frequency gauge, he found Bill Hewlett's phone number in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the corporate research laboratory at Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager, I moved up and up in HP, hanging around that computer, and started writing programs for him.
How he invents innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during an interview about how he invents new products while running.
In the beginning of his career, when he set out to sell a few printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
He only had 30 days paid for, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we were fighting wildly... yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] until I got tired of it, I came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we managed to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies run out of breath:
Long before leading the resurrection of Apple, Jobs prudently predicted that many industrial leaders would fluctuate in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox companies, so you make better copiers or printers, so what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are already in place, so companies are being run by people in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are being thrown out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led society to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox Company...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times the size of it, could have been Microsoft in the '90s...
Instead of winning, however, they earned a loss.
How does he take innovation as an art form:
"There is still a long way to go and a lot of work between an excellent idea and an excellent resulting product... and as the great idea develops, it changes and expands."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to accept a whole series of compromises - certain things just don't make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in some way you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and coincidentally also the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was dealt with by the court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question as to whether it would accept an objection to President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a festive dinner sponsored by a law firm that would take part in the hearing before the court.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions put forward.
One of the cases discussed was the action brought by 26 states questioning the radical overhaul of healthcare last year by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to listen to the lawsuit, but in March, a 5.5-hour meeting is expected, with the result of which the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court of law and will try to get the bill dismissed will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as United States Attorney General during the reign of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, which has been concerned with defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Entrepreneurship.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at the Washington hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
She was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the senior Republican representative in the Senate and confirmed opponents of the Health Care Act.
And the honored guests?
It is nothing new: This pair of judges have been taking part in the Federalist Society's events for years.
And it's certainly not even anything that goes against ethical rules.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their behaviour would certainly fall under the principle C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions that are currently being organised by related and other organisations to raise funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor be listed on the agenda of the event."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas with two legal firms operating in the case, as well as companies with huge financial interest in this case, was enough to alert ethics activists in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to code of conduct contradicts the assertion by several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," stated Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause organization.
"Judges drank and dined at social benefit together with attorneys waiting to discuss their case in court".
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines their feet with all claims of disinterest, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics and told them that they too seamlessly combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Ginnie is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, Conservatives argue that Judge Elena Kagan mainly has an ethical problem and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General during President Obama's reign when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Critics of Kagan are pushing her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought so much for the law at the time that she could now be unbiased.
Kagan didn't indicate she was about to resign.
Boeing has won a record contract for US$18 billion jets
The Emirates airlines order 50 two-street Boeing 777 jet aircraft with the possibility of purchasing 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air airlines for which it collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is the company and the price of these 50 aircraft totals a record $18 billion, it is something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing acquired the contract: the Middle East, an expanding gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago Company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need US$450 billion of aircraft over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history over the weekend as regards dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-street current Boeings 777.
The sensational order came from the Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, making the total value of the order up to USD 26 billion.
Monday, then, Boeing announced that they had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar, said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
This means that they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - mostly damaging airlines, because these are some of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself is making money at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from the airline Emirates consolidates the leading position of Boeing in the wide fuselage market and brings Airbus SAS to the narrow, wanting to try to disrupt Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport model.
The victory of Boeing comes four months after Airbus representatives have announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of 777-300ER, will be postponed.
The displacement occurred because customers demanded more utility load and range, so the manufacturer took time to deliver more power to the engine to the machine.
The price of Boeing Co's events increased by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
Mexican president's sister was apparently defeated in the Michoacian election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers helped her opponent, Faust Vallejo of the PRI, in pursuit of the governor's chair.
It appears that Sister Felipe Calderon lost in the violent state election for the post of governor in Michoacán, and subsequently stated on Monday that one of her opponents had been helped by drug traffickers to win.
Preliminary results attributed the leadership in the Western State's governorial election to Faust Vallejo by the Institute Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The interventions of members of organised crime into the entire electoral process, and especially until yesterday's election itself, are alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview for the radio the day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion poll group... confiscating ballot boxes, building road roadblocks... and letting people vote on order for the PRI.
The PRI Party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, it plans an early return to power, and winning the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI Party hopes to win even in July in the presidential election.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was still leading the election a day before the election, only very narrowly.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative party of her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party's left-wing party, or PRD, which has so far dominated the governor's office.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's native state, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
Violence, however, persisted.
The mayor of PAN, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However, whatever the results of the elections in Michoacán look like for the PRI party, winning will help the party get a new impulse.
The expected PRI Party representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the upcoming year."
The ADB Bank calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the ADB bank based in Manila, said that two fastest-growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help rapidly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the Bric Group states [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all European difficulties "too unexcited" and stated that Asian financial assistance combined with European leadership and means will help to avert the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said for the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely subjected to a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, the borrowing costs of Italy have risen dangerously, and both the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could pull the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge to bring the emerging leading economies together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but he noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU financial assistance, an institution for European financial stability - would provide greater bargaining opportunities for Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what she can" to help the Eurozone, because her own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and the tributary of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We face a difficult task and must maintain a high growth rate".
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S. said that it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from USD 2 or less per day.
"They might find that Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy vacations on beaches, which would probably be hard to explain to them," he remarked.
Lee Howell, CEO of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian supplies should be used to maintain well paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis threatens a "dangerous domino effect".
The Bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable emerging markets must create "plans of unpredictable spending" to protect them from a decline and a marked outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon Warning on Possible Defense Cuts
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta firmly attached to the boiler on Monday in Congress, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could endanger national security and trigger financial chain reaction beginning at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefields in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a USD 450 billion budget reduction over the next decade, but is now worried about a $600 billion reduction if Congress fails to conclude an spending agreement.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress' inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment will result in a 23% flat-rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this indiscreet way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipping projects - you cannot buy just three quarters of the building or ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to further modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to Senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake with the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously harm its readiness."
In the end, cuts will also touch combat troops, announced Panetta.
"Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not directly affect this interruption, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in negotiated contracts supporting our people's war efforts."
"Reductions of paid staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and subsequent disruption of legal and political support."
Both Senators wrote off Panette ten days ago and asked him for details on possible effects on automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a standstill at the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power".
"We are strictly opposed to this harsh measure," Senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetto's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"Planned cuts are a threat to United States national security, which we should not allow".
"Only to see if Panett's letter and fresh warning will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplify the votes calling to leave the Pentagon off the list of scrapped areas.
Panetta has been increasingly open in talks about possible cuts lately, although he himself switched to his high position at the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was embarking on a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute-long week, the Minister of Defence indicated a brief picture of what his resort could expect - the shell of the army, but within which the core will be missing.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"He will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings, and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of a speech at the Pentagon.
"She will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed..."
In an annex delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant reduction of airborne options and deployments around the world; presumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could expect to end, including those already tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35 aircraft project, a planned new bomber, next-generation ballistic submarines, a new coastal combat ship and a new ground combat vehicle to which the Army and Marine Corps wanted to replace humvee.
By stopping further development and testing of the F35 aircraft, it would save US$80 billion over the next decade, but its supporters claim that this is a necessary further step in improving the army, which is needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
Recognizing a Lie
A glimpse of recent headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with allegations that he sexually harassed several women - both sides claim the latter lies.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury while trying to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling American President Barrack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have been able to destroy their careers and block the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using funds from his campaign to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that sprang around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It's crawling with stories of cheating at school and college.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and deceit are acceptable.
How many frauds do we encounter?
Studies show that in one day, you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers had lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first encounter in life.
Determining lies, or "recognising lies", is a necessary skill that anyone should acquire, whether for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that is similar, say, to Sharada, when one shouts, "I have you." Recognizing deception is a serious sector of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're squirming, stuttering, blushing or squirming.
But do not conclude that it is somehow difficult to spot and expose liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from an extensive and emerging sector regarding the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be of great help in today's complicated world - especially if your work responsibilities include hiring, holding interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, letting them be alert, directing their emotions, and intuitively realizing how the other side accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (but the lies they say are usually "unspeakable").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's normal behavior.
It's called initial observation.
Thanks to him, he'll have something to compare later on.
Notice the subject's posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone routinely constantly taps their legs so you don't wrongfully accuse him of lying just because he starts to tap his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But consider it only as warning signals, not as proof of a lie.
People who tell lies can stop moving the upper half of the body while trying to remember their fictional story, the shoe tips can turn to the door, lean towards the exit, significantly change the posture, or show "relief after the end of the interview" - excessive relief of breath and position change when the confession is difficult behind them.
Often interviewers give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what relief will look like after it ends.
Feel also the language of the subject.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once misrepresented himself and used past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a nationwide search for her body.
Deceiving individuals may also express themselves measuredly: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or they repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal characteristics are very slight.
Someone can use a lot of "melting language" when he answers the difficult question, "Well... to be honest... from what I know... to my best knowledge."
We don't know a lot of facts in such an answer, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no spell to reveal every lie, but it is possible to master the skills that can be used to stalk a lie.
With these skills, one will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a fraud in his personal and work life.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be rerouted after a threat of postponing approval by the US government has emerged
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which pitted the unions against each other, but calmed down environmentalists - a company in charge of building the pipeline announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things would move again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it would move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills region of Nebraska, and is convinced that the project would still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada's scale Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead through another route.
This announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it had postponed the decision on the federal permit of the project, from which it would not conduct studies of possible replacement routes that could not interfere with the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala water layer, a vast underground water supply.
"This is really a move forward," said Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after the next year's elections, but the authorities refuse that politics would play a role in the decision.
In a written statement from last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will link Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Alberta province to refineries in Texas, I eat 700,000 barrels of oil per day.
That way, six states will have to be crossed.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work crews that estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on the pipeline.
Lawmakers in Nebraska, however, opposed this plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and in the Ogallala water layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the Inspector General from the Ministry had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, and focused mainly on two issues.
Once it was whether the lobbyist hired TransCanada Company, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's adviser in 2008, did not present a conflict of interest in the program.
Another then whether the firm that was hired to carry out the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of throwing up her toddler in fear.
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter so much that she vomited out of fear.
The performance of the singer's hit "Lady Marmalade" frightened eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," claims her family in a lawsuit filed to Manhattan's Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk met down to the lobby of their house in the Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes" and I left to pick her up"
LaBelle irritably reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking dirty - shouting out loud the most rude words...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she started splashing water on me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I told that woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort, who subsequently dragged her to the waiting car, testified Roseanna Monk.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so much, she vomited, she delivered.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle but received no answers.
The lawyer and speaker of singer LaBelle are not responding to our calls to comment on the whole case.
The lawsuit calls for more unspecified compensation, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to dedicate all the money to a charitable cancer organization.
"The goal is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate Disaster Slowed the Economy
During the first year of the reign of Maria López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined and with them the economy
This is the first year of the reign of Maria López Valdez, which is called the government of change itself, and this government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, but no growth was recorded due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year and even the main indicators of economic development have declined.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the possibilities of growth of the state economy, resulting in a reduction in economic activity of 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In agriculture, there was a historical decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors as well.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded at 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, 78.03% of which was completely destroyed and partial damage was found at the remaining 21.07%. The main destroyed crops include vegetables, maize and games.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state experienced an increased increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents of Sinaloa state were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise and reached 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed people.
Less liquidity
More factors are responsible for unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa. According to Gerard López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on actions taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing increasing unemployment, which is linked to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the reduction of resources due to legislation passed by Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to make money, invest them or use them for anything," he stressed.
Stopping Migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad to work in the United States has declined, both because of difficult entry and then because even if these people get abroad, it is hard for them to get a job. People remain and demand work from our state, and thus unemployment is rising", he said.
Unreliability
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the state’s employed people work without taking social security benefits.
Other labour market features such as low salaries are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory there are the lowest salaries from all over the country, as reported by the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour Secretariat and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was by September 5,352 pesetas, deep below the national average, which ranges on the amount of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years has also been recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697 between January and June, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,14,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the Government of the State lists investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the state Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million pesos. By November, no debt gains were recorded in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the reign of Mario López Valdés pointed out a lack of governing powers of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, stated that in 2011 the will of individual sectors, including the government itself, was lacking.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We have to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, the harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully, next year will be much better", he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López stated that events like frosts in the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"Weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism, which would enable us to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. That is why we found ourselves well below the expected forecasts at the end of the year", he said.
Re-defining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriart, President of the Employment Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we observe that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared, in which the objectives and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that all the potential material and human resources that Sinaloa has be mobilised", he said.
Work That Is Before Us
Chairman Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better manage the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there have been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan", he said.
He stated that the current administration showed progress with regard to public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us", he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
The Navolo residents were sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for a crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican Army's forces on 7 June 2010 on an errand on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo District, Callavo.
The dealer drove in a van of type pick up white color. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and in the passenger seat a small backpack. Soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the Second Department and the proceedings remain internal within the framework of the Center for the Realisation of the Legal Effects of Crimes.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Hábitat, the Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants, face the risk of not being dragged to the end or being much delayed due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development has stated that if construction work has so far gone forward, there is now a risk that the government of the state will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state is 25%. Until this time, only the Federation and the city have provided the means of work, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They are supposed to secure nearly 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we have received nothing at all. Even though we were supposed to get part of it in July," he said. "To avoid wasting time, we started and continue our projects very successfully, but we are short of money".
He stated that last year, for the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan to be able to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to raise funds to cover what did not finish the state", he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise by state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that a request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary for Administration and Finance, to hasten the proceedings and the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us $12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even received a peso yet".
The Court approves the "end of analogous broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidency decree, which wants to hasten the so-called "off analogic signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He stated that there were no needed eight votes to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mez, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree stating the individual steps that would lead to the transition to Earth's digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected because the qualified majority of eight votes needed to allow the court to comment on the constitutionality or incoherence of the decree in question, which thus remains valid, were not reached.
The motion for a judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare a decree unconstitutional because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter that is legally reserved for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitisation.
The Ministerial Meeting also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the proposal also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that a federal executive could not structure measures through general standards to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator", recalling that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of a federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analogous signals by digital is one of the greatest changes the world has seen in recent years. It is related to better use of radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitization, which requires decisions on public interest, because digitization has not only a technical dimension, but "it also touches on economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these questions "require an operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences entrusted to the Constitution by the Government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialised technical authorities at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that interferes to some extent in the area of congressional powers, to introduce compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers into the administration area.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the figures published by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "voice after vote" appeared in this year's Michoacán election, where, in accordance with the data published by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election was less than 27 percent, and 879 votes from a total of 6074 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
In this context, the Chair of the General Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be noted, Michoacán did not officially confirm his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Law on Election Justice. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire during this term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel neglected their publication within the prescribed deadline in the Act of the Official State Gazette, stating that he had any objections against them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "unvalid and illegal" because it has no right to "neither approve nor veto them".
On the question of the possibility of a 'voice-to-voice' census, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that by approving the relevant measures, the General Council of the IEM would allow the local electoral body to carry out both partial and total censuses.
In this way, a partial census of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of the census and calculation in the appropriate box or the chair does not have it available; or if errors and obvious violations of electoral results have occurred.
In addition, the total recount of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is evidence suggesting that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request by the party representative and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
The total count of votes will also be possible when, after a proper census, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also if there is an explicit request from the political party whose candidate finished in the second place. In this case, the electoral packages for which a partial census has been made will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been added up.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé, confirmed by the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a ceremony and a memorial service.
According to the family, Lieutenant-Colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the others who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortése family returned to the capital Coahuila on board the Mexican Air Force plane. Family and closest friends took part in the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, Lieutenant Colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell was held at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, organized by his former high school students and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of graduation preparation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. That's what he always said to his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire Aire Air School in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he even drove a truck, however he always followed his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls him as a very good man, "the barely arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he drove to Zapopán for his uncle’s graduation, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked best in life: driving an airplane.
They gave him one last good-bye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we parted ways with all the honours that Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in the studio and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the helicopter he was driving fell. On board was also Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of that state.
At 18:05, the remains of Saltillen's native Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be handed over through burial service to Mexican air forces under Major Jaime Martinez on the grounds, where in the meantime a family gathered, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found at Cadereyta NL's farmhouse
Several hours before the discovery, military officials introduced 11 persons who were detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime to the media.
The bodies of three men murdered by shooting into different parts of the body and the head were found at the abandoned farmhouse of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery occurred at a 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the lodge with the beige-caffee fence had, from time to time, an open door.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person was wearing a sports shirt of yellow color and dark cotton trousers and was not wearing a shoe. Next to him, one was also in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away, the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants was found.
All three of them were lying face-down.
According to the data collected at the scene, all three persons were probably murdered in another location because bullets were not found.
Messages were found on the cottage fence addressed by one group of organized crime others as well as a number of bullet tracks, both on the building and on the door.
There were 11 suspects in Cadereyta.
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 people among whom there are also juveniles who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, persecutions, and illegal burials.
According to published information in the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros Colony, 8 people were detained and managed to free one detainee.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, confirming they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another raid occurred on 12 November at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when he noticed a car with no plates and two persons in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, a casing, and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was detained on 13 November around 14:00. When he saw soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country in the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country under the brink of economic disaster, which has put the entire euro area in danger.
The Presidential Palace issued a report announcing that Monti, named on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm to him that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti stated that he would present to the President the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult stage", said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has made the debt rise to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough package of austerity that is required by European leaders, and that will be the only way to restore Italy's damaged credibility.
Due to the instability of the markets, the interest on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of 7 percentage points exceeded the level at which Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairman of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told journalists after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this pressing situation.
Monti's hopes of success multiplied significantly thanks to support from PDL Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results", said journalist Angelina Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now a number of its members have opposed the government with a technocratic majority compiled by Monti.
Parliament support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in a given effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Foreign Bank Association joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti began negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The round closes on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who allowed a very rapid procedure in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline from the end of last week, when it was already obvious that Berlusconi would resign, the interest of Italian bonds returned to the critical limit and thus respond to the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt amounts to 1.8 trillion euro, would be beyond the scope of the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti stated that his government should remain in power until the next 2013 elections, despite general forecasts that claim that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms, and then declare early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties that the country has reached due to financial pressure.
Political sources have said that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to incorporate political figures into government.
The Spaniards participate in international matches more often than the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten exceed the 50 international match line.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 called players reached the number of 50 matches.
Huge contrast on the Costa Rica side if we compare 22 players of both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly ratings, have a wide range of Class A cross-selection matches on their account, Costa Rica only has defender Michael Uman, who was the only one to play 50 international matches.
He reached this figure last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the Battle of the Stars and in the powerful clubs of the English First League have maintained intense activity in league championships and home cups and high-level matches within the European Cups as Champions League for over a year.
We must also add to the previous experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited foreign match options in the area. There is, for example, a Concacaf which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representation is on the account of the Íker Casillas goalkeeper, who last Saturday before England (a loss of 0-1 in London) reached former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will continue today against Costa Rica and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player of Barcelona, has 106 games in his account.
Casillas and Xavi were officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and middle striker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
A hundred came close to Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
They follow Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and near Michael Uman are moving left wing Júnior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Further only 5 surpassed the 30 match line: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are featured.
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's best scorer is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of celebrating twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity for them to play Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate twenty years of existence and on Sunday 20 will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day he performs from 19:30 at the National Stadium along with the angelic group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample from an interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the La Nación website on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican supporters, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The trip to Costa Rica is our dream, which is becoming a reality.
We've barely been in South and Central America a second time, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally love the group here, fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your sharpest supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took us so long.
Some people have been talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've performed in the last 21 years were made within a few weeks.
We performed some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we got in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle, for both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surf friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, which is the best place to surf, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there's no limit to what we can't do.
We will try to perform the best possible show with diverse tracks. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 tracks and everyone likes different tracks, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art track.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could imagine being in one big rock group and staying in it for more than 20 years, sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and we are touched that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We're lucky to see the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the emergence of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which all the greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it does not often happen.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We're proud of it, and we're honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
Sometimes we still play with some.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and second of all, the fact that we're constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this we have managed to open up musical paths that allow everyone sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it became increasingly easier to find balance.
We try not to travel too much on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came because of music, you remember that you have to respect music and what you gave her, you can't get carried away by being famous, rock stars, neither of us really cared about that.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and it was something spectacular at the beginning.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and so many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to start the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as openers?
Yes, production has sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious what Las Robertas offers live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's an Ed question, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing to his mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I could talk all night about bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt slightly separated from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I imagine the groups I referred to as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music is so valid today, it's something great, because it's music worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever.
At the beginning, your music had a slightly bleak character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
This is interesting because I feel that in the new album there are a few tracks that are lighter coming along, but there are also songs such as The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very bleak, although they may sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're songs deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from a family or a friend, these things start affecting your art and music, and these two songs represent this to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss suffered in the lower limbs area, informed by his attending physician.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, for which he has been operated four times and has already been controlled by doctors.
A member of Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told television station Canal N that Fujimori will be undergoing tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori might receive a pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times due to tongue cancer, dropped 18 kilograms, and other disorders such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in his legs were added to these problems, and the doctor named them.
Fujimori has served his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons killed by a murdering squadron of troops acting illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, with the aim of expanding trade between the two nations and touching the political issues of the region.
Mujica meets his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón on Wednesday. It is the most important meeting of large-scale visits full of meetings with political, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries", published the Uruguay presidential office on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community, which prompted a dismissive opinion from Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 since November. The G20 is a group formed by the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concreteise fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "blacklist" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), on which there are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have had a free trade agreement (FTA) concluded since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been relentlessly fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all shops around the world this month, was created from the outset to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses is supposed to work", reported a press officer specialized in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because until this moment successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
A spokesman for Nintendo stated that in addition to the image being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go to the "second round" at the levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the event. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome all kinds of challenges and "not succumb to optical delusions".
This new appearance of Super Maria in 3D also assumes with the return of the character to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays to the tune of those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous episodes. It consists in the plumber of a bearded man having to pass through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in surroundings, in disguises and also among enemies, he also appears "playful" Luigi.
Colom approved Portilla's release to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had advanced steps on the issue of the release of former President Alfons Portillo, to be held accountable in the United States for a $70 million conspiracy to launder US dollars.
This is the end of the process, the aim of which was for Guatemala to respond at the request of the northern country, which requires the release of Portilla to be able to judge him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he was aware that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he had not "interrupted" in court decisions and allowed all extraditions that had reached his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means a move of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be released after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling 120 million in the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency. This trial preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and returned the case to play.
Trinijove helped 6000 young in a state of danger
The organization was formed to help children without education, so that they would not find themselves on the outskirts of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Support Organization is very important: 6,000 young people who have been threatened with social exclusion have been helped, helping them to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this end, it is necessary to add a long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a balance in the ceremonial act, which took place in the former production premises of both Fabra and Coats and attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was formed in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 in order to help young people with low education, jobless, drug addiction, or a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreo was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, in the time of the election, showed the uniform character of work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current ecological-socialist Councillor Ricard Goma, attended the ceremonial act.
The great Fabra and Coats hall was also attended by the current social welfare and family advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the CEO of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was formed at a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the Association has brought to this day, "is a good foundation".
The President listed Trinijove as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was an eviction of an occupied house in which giant parties were held
Intruders appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the number 51 neighbors on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, illegally residing and organized giant parties that woke the neighbors, leaving the building under court orders without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded", said the warden.
Occupants who took up 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the remaining ones are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water equipment, in addition they painted walls and left behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties took place in the first three apartments, which lasted up to two days and awakened other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europa Press that while the building was occupied, the revenues fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupations of the building made her unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbors' noise lawsuits. However, the problems were not caused by discos, but by residents of the occupied house and especially by those who took part in the organized parties, whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the area.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiving her rent for nine months.
The city police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chair of the PP People's Party City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately evicted and thus put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area".
The chair of the People's Party explained that only one floor had been taken a summer ago, but in recent months, the occupying parties had reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civil responsibility that have occurred in the building".
Yesterday, city police also cleared out the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock 30 minutes, police reached building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four of them were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of a hearing that carries more than controversy over fees
The city tender for 16 gates again opens the debate about the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the greatest bloom of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets to support Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
More importantly, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.
After the disappearance of CMB in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalonian capital is one of the few, which is not oriented to the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualifications as a natural park go this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with boars instead of a Yogi bear.
This was the position until September when the City Hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate records the park's idea.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate in the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and a reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona's architects.
It's already a theme as tacky as when two members of this old caste of chosen people shake hands in an elevator meeting.
And it was this act that triggered one of the rare congruents between what three Barcelona architects and preeminent university professors think.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol, and Marta Bayona: the tender has its merits.
According to Roldan, after the question of the bay side was raised, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefons Cerd's speech on green apples was not reached to the end.
"We must base ourselves on the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, by its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect for whom the name "gates to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as defining zones where they can be operated".
MODOL, like Roldan and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "insecurity presented today by the public place project" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the Forum area "its swan singing".
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Something to define means to take the next step", that is essentially moving on.
"It is necessary to keep in mind new urban and planning tools because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
Looking more closely at the question, Modol believes that Collserola's valley slope can be "considered a park", but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographical reasons.
MODOL also recalled that there was already work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "may not end up at the junkyard", although it welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its grémia that it will intervene in the project from "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and city is a kind of pass allowing architects to engage in debate, but "doubts", that it should be precisely this technical profile, which will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds), which must be created: "Architekti should only be tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex because there is no global vision of Collserol in the tender documentation: "16 tenders have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
This causes at least him to sign up for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may refer to the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above Ronda de Dalt should provide a zone of equipment throughout the length to ensure a smooth transition between the city and greenery.
Casino is pardoned by Jonah Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, legal agent Cadino Red granted pardon to Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after legal agent Casino Red granted him a pardon in front of the Second Criminal Court in the district, which discussed the blackmail case in which Mayor Monterrey's brother was charged.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonás was to ask him to pay an economic quota to allow the Monterrey Town Hall to allow illegal operation in the betting house.
After a public indictment, the State Prosecutor initiated a prosecution of the brother of the Panist mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After spending four hours in front of Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antigua in the state capital.
He remained at this site for the next 49 days after the Second Incarceration Order was passed and the Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with an amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderately heavy supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in San Nicolás de los Garza city cells during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after nearly two months of investigation sufficient evidence was collected to prove Jonah’s guilt. Evidence includes, for example, the payment of the sum of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be made possible.
This Monday, the legal agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for mercy for the region's mayor's brother, on the basis of which he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been corrected and who of the associates decided to grant pardon.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonah Larrazábal. In a trial against him, no complaint will be possible. Nor can it be claimed for damages or punishment.
After a trial with a legal agent around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Bretón.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, came to a prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonah that he was granted official pardon and his case was postponed to archive.
He also announced to him that the judge issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details of the air crash in which the Governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) informed that the results of the accident investigation, in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven others died, show that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, stated that before the start of the aircraft the pilot stated that the climate conditions allowed the flight.
"Parts that appear suggest that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, wings entangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull".
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore meeting all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the field of impact.
"The search found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft crashed into the mainland as whole.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 people, meeting all requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, the managing director of airports and auxiliary services stated that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a routine overflight operation", he said.
At a press conference, SCT Representative Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of inquiry:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, meaning that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate launch conditions, according to which the aircraft progresses towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico visible layers of frowns at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to clouds the crew sought a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The crash coordinates and the last radar recording match, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory prior to the impact.
Dissipation of aircraft residues in restricted territory:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A sketch of the dissipation of the remnants of the aircraft suggests that at the time of impact on the mainland the helicopter was whole.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence was recorded at the scene of the accident to indicate that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloped, the slope level goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage of the likely disintegration along that route.
The information provides elements that seem to suggest that the helicopter could have made contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the designated area, the remains of the helicopter were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still whole.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance began research into a gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it conducts research to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. A research called "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Youth" will allow you to gain results on overweight.
In a report by the head of the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Health Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition professionals and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and pupils of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center of Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without permission, can also participate in research. People can come to participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every sober will be tested by teenagers from 8 am.
He stressed that research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Nevahualcóyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace to Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It specified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are carried out every Saturday for all participants (trying to identify genes involved in childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects health care workers' concern over the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health polls conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that only boys experienced a 77% increase in obesity and 47% increase in girls in just six years. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight', said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one reason for finding indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican had 65% Indian-American genetic features, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in genes that are responsible for developing diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thus establishing whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of wrinkles of dark color (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the probability that the individual will suffer metabolic problems and pre-scarcase conditions.
So far, the information is confidential, doctors give it to their parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make to avoid disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life meaning a lack of daily physical activity, a day-long sitting in front of television, and the use of means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight also causes large caloric intakes, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in Asfalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and creates a mixture with better functionality, independently of climatic conditions and temperature
If the paving was properly cared for, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Region, Rafael Herrera Najer, a scientist from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the technological cause of the potholes he made during the International Year of Chemistry announced that the laboratory under his direction develops modified asphalts with polymers, thus creating a mixture with similar characteristics as asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this kind of modified tarmac could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the formation of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with large molecular weights called asphalt, and others with low molecular weights called mortars. Together, they give asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
Viskoelastic character of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees has high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, alerted the expert on chemical engineering.
A science scientist from the Faculty of Chemical Sciences observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible tiles made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt liner, consisting of small stones soaked in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms a insert is covered with tarmac.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the tile will break down well.
If it were modified asphalt, they would decompose even better, he thinks a chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer called the mantle, formed by fine stones, is placed on the tarmac insert, i.e. sand also soaked in tarmac.
As this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt liner and must ensure friction of the road.
As part of the paving will be exposed to heavy loads, the cloak must have sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to bear in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the tarmac liner.
Once the terrain is damp, the water spreads in and it is hard to get out, it causes softening of all layers of paving and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that during the formation of potholes, the first film of the cloak will be damaged and only then the tarmac liner will be damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one moment, but it is a slow process that should stop at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of paving must correspond to the burden of vehicles and must ensure that this burden is not exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do, and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, tarmac emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and enable us to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing a candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Sernam not winning the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus earns the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca again did not reach Miss Colombia's crown.
Melina Ramírez Sernam had to settle for finding herself on the stage of the winners, gaining a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multimiss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and the scepter took over Miss Atlántico, the said department received the 14th title of the first multimiss. Melina joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca, who reached the reach of the winning crown, but were eventually promulgated by the first multiplemiss. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
What was missing?
The result is the defeat of a great favourite who has shown in all previous rounds that she has the ability to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of Police and the Finest Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have reached, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took away the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury had decided to name it only First Multimiss is the fact that it did not convince its answer to the question, "Which book did you like best and why?", which was written by Martín Murillo Gómez from the Leamos literary editorship.
When asked by the candidate, she replied:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culture. The book that affected me most in my childhood was the "Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a beautiful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
This response was displeased because of the term "culturalize" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain to her what the individual books mentioned made to her.
After the end of the ceremony, Melina stated that she was calm and happy about the outcome: "The world is wise what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read, if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
Bogotian journalist suggested that the candidate's popularity, most celebrated from the beginning, and the one who took away all the previous prizes (The Gastronomy Challenge of Oster, the public title for the best art dress and the Queen's mother) had aroused the envy of other contenders, stressing out the queen who then burned on the scene.
It was evident at the first presentation of swimwear on Hilton Beach and during two shows before the final crowning.
Although she was glowing on both, it was known that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on "Like Home" at Canal RCN believes that Melinda's winning the title of first multimiss confirms the fact that a candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up leaving with the Queen's crown".
Moreover, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude toward the media in recent days, and this has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the foundation of the National Beauty Competition.
On the edge, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty stated they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia beauty competition itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feeling. It is important for candidates to be involved in such projects before they enter the competition", she explained.
It is also speculated that candidate Valle has lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosis that was evident on her butt. However, this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which elected her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on her butt, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took her points off until the last day".
Meanwhile, a journalist named Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that a native of Valle made a mistake in undergoing several surgical procedures.
"The surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Vallo.
The body was never her strong suit and this is where she took her toll".
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, there was a harsh prediction that came true after the bathing suit parade. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo allowed Melina not to eventually grant her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina has launched the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, to which she will be appointed the National Competition itself.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the stunning success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of the Cali resident who identified Alfons Can's corpse
A fingerprint expert from Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonsa Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: "Alphonse Cana", through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at CTI's department this week, it was Eliazar González' turn, a man from Puerto Tejad, who has been working in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the Choco City Hall, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000, he relocated to the capital of Valle and, after taking the relevant courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. palms and legs.
In the week of the operation against that Alfons Cane, Eliazaro was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he set off for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmiro.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it due to physical appearances.
He had no beard, dressed as a villager in the area, with no glasses, much slenderer.
But prints don't lie.
Along with galton's magnifying glass, ink and transplanter and light, Eliaszar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse to the card entries.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man native to Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm whether he was really the supreme commander of Farc.
Tracking
For a dactyloscope from Sijin de Cali, the acclaim that President Juan Manuel Santos showed to Eliasar González at a press conference of the operational service against "Cana" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in decision-making crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in research on crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present false documents or don't have papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and search their database.
The Investigator told that in the event of injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall, because at this place the thief leaned on to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we could get a full hand print and identify the perpetrator involved in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in a murder case.
A while ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and a print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it is not 100 percent possible to confirm that he was really the killer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A fingerprint expert from CTI explained that from objects, prints "curry using chemical or physical reactive substances".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to collect them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are currently many Colombians whose data are not recorded anywhere", said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that glitters, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there's traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Indignation" protests in New York City
Hundreds of manifestants were cramped to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and relocated to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York City officials on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square, where they were brought out in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestos were distressed at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get through a court order that allowed "indignant" to return to camp on the site. The second part of the movement responded to the evacuation by taking up a park in the north of the city where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle in order to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful manifestations", said one of the speakers of the 'Occupate Wall Street' movement, Mark Bray.
Bray made it clear that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of the camp ordered by New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, came to trial where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the site and allowing the manifestos to continue camping here.
In addition, the "indignation" also took up another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the parish in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and intercepted some of the manifestos. Bray did not know the exact number, but stated that he saw that they had placed the cuffs even to some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site, and a delegation of religious officials has also come to express support for them and also to try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the relocated manifestos even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to the members who guarded the square, causing "some small clashes", Bray said, condemning the fact that some police officers had beaten the manifestos.
The court order forbids authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or applying "laws that were published after the commission began, or prohibiting manifestos from accessing the park with shops or other places they previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg stated to the press that, due to this court order, the city suspended the reopening of public space and the manifestos warned that local laws did not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's senior representative personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and approached because the manifestos "broken the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it became "a place to which people did not go protest, but to break the laws and in some cases hurt others" because "some stores received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared for the quality of their lives".
"The morning cleanup was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people", added a spokesman to a movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they planned to organize "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and union organizations to commemorate the two months after which protests persist, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present Our Lady on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he appears in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a lifeguard in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", the wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show of Canadian television.
A private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, would appear in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and would embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from internet home pornographic films, appears with her ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Maria holding a baby doll representing Baby Jesus.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, has recently served as presenter on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a special Christmas broadcast by CTV will feature Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Recently Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York City "a fox".
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus ends the period of downfall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of falls, the GDP figure reached a position between July and September that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP grew 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% annually.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - assume the greatest growth rate compared to January to March 2010.
The revival can be partly explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of earthquake-damaged areas and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending declined by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to come out of it to strengthen or rebuild infrastructures, which is to use the lack to start from scratch.
Japan has awakened, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, travels and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors running away from the euro area debt crisis and from the worrying US forecasts.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony blamed their weak results in July until September on the Yen course.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We have to look out for risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen", said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that foresees inflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even went below the average, which is located at level 100. It reached level 99.13 points.
Athens Spreads Insecurities Again
Papadimos says austerity will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty that once again prevailed, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "consistency" of the new transitional Greek government is given to the demands of Brussels rather than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to confirm.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms, and that the 100-day period he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, the Conservative Party chairman, Antonis Samaras, stated that the new austerity measures would in no way support and reiterated his requirement to launch new elections on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the 26 October summit", declared Papadimos yesterday during the parliamentary debate, culminating tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the government.
The package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify any doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have no further commitment".
The Conservative chairman went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF, and these organizations have unlocked the 8 billion they urgently need in Athens, but at the same time he has stated that he will not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angry at the impact that Papandre's referendum games have caused, stressed yesterday that its demands are impermeable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and leaders of the main parties sign a 'written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible'.
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from the Three will return "very soon" to Athens and will discuss with the new government "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of 8 billion.
The Greek launderette still has a little more to confuse with.
Queen Sofia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
Yesterday, the Queen launched a 5th global micro-lending summit in Valladolid, believing that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is a matter of achieving targets to achieve a reduction by half of the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, i.e. the amount that sets the poverty threshold".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the volunteer network "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to whom these loans are intended in particular.
"We have achieved many" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The micro-lending summit is supposed to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic goals".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-lending spread to Spain and to other states of the world after "a pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus embarked on this journey", the queen said, adding that it was an "act of justice and of the necessary recognition".
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who set out on the road to combat poverty". She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted with his lending policy on the spot.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to find a constant development, the queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned her the title of 'head of the family', which was awarded to her in Valladolid by the 'movement of the poor'.
Queen Sofia concluded her performance by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions and thus allowing them to continue to fight poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, stated that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that must be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balohobyte, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and do not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-lending is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept of giving confidence to people to whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor Valladolidu, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city, which "opens its gates to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
The CDU proposes voting for a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and Chair of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig on the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU).
The issue of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider government policy today vis-à-vis the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians as lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were opposed and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of standing ovation at the conclusion of Angela Merkel's performance, and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time has come for changes".
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage 'to give Europe one face'.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary move: the United Kingdom opposes, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, the delegates rejected, by a large majority, the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the European Central Bank's board, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a weight strengthening of Germany.
The Chancellor made several references to Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not try to gain a congress to talk about "little" European states or states in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal concerning Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does incapacity fraud represent?
Following the aid, the UMP Party and the Government are launching an offensive against incompetence.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15, and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak on the topic recurring since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incompetence.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start taking aid in sickness.
Clearly, without the company's consent, an employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing much bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
Also, a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic scope: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity (until now they have no inability compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are subject to discussion, the right-wing majority also triggers the theme of fraud aimed at evil this time tied to work incompetence.
"Controls will be much more extensive and additionally: if you are caught, you will be returned", warned Xavier Bertrand in an interview provided by RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about inadequacy in work.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant surveillance since 2002 and the political upheaval that has yielded its fruit.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance company), more than EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, daily payments with their €11.3 billion accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternal contributions and accidents at work, and 54% concerned incompetence, i.e. €6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to the Alma Consulting group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which contains some deviations: another poll published in 2007 at the Monster.com job opportunities website showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed replied that it had not chosen any day of incapacity.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of work incompetence was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are not more prone to incompetence than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in incompetence is only a very small part of the job.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused systematic checks to be carried out on incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term inability to "illegal or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetences longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were counted at 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132,000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorised" cases for several million employees who had inability to work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing black work.
According to Mr Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euro missing in the tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words before Parliament, adding that a hundred days given to his government of unity would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new bailout budget plan", said the Prime Minister when he delivered his first public speech on Wednesday in opening the debate to vote on trust in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the eurozone summit will be the 'main task' of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is at stake, added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "in the vicinity of 9%" of the gross domestic product from now to the end of 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
The right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday for an already approved measure in order to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party did not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures", Samaras stressed at the meeting with Members for his New Democracy Party.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollie Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economy and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the expert committee
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, death is denied to Canadians.
In the matter of palliative care, the commission urgently requires that governments, health-care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in different areas, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This commission recommends changing criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when this choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts quote a recent poll by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada gave rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are told by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the wish to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
This average applies to the entire of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is the highest with 86% of those who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reach conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it wants nothing to change in criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also subjected to control all countries where these approaches are legalised or not regarded as criminal cases, there is no evidence that this criminalization causes any misuse in the application, i.e. in practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or disagreeing.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than many cases of these misdemeanors in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized at the teleconference yesterday.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is also done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
Let us recall that according to an inquiry conducted by Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already voiced themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that they will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the life of old or disabled persons is of lesser value.
With regard to those practicing assisted suicide, 41% of the persons questioned consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In the matter of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also requires professional physicians to be educated to be obliged to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their lives without fear of prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the commission urgently requires that governments, health-care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the matter of palliative or final attenuation already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the commission demands that it be considered as being no longer used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations to other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society's expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" among others because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask to help him commit suicide", says Pierre Deschamps, who studied résumé reports yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the person above all the other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts particularly about the data of the report regarding the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about "competence"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad manifested in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists them and talks about a "complaint" against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension of membership in the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, adopted an opinion in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was the first ruler of the Arab state yesterday to call on President Bashar al-Assad to take in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed," he handed over power".
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life", said the king of Jordan, a country adjacent to Syria, in an interview for BBC station.
On behalf of his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year were not crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave" he said with a reference to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is increasingly pursuing a tougher line.
The United States rejoiced at the "enhancing consensus against Assad and the dishonest conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are increasingly applying a tougher tone" towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in Deraa in the south of Syria during this time.
According to this NGO, two other civilian persons have died" in gunfights and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouall estimated that the country had "set its way out of the crisis".
After all, he responded live to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus's membership, which, according to him, represents a "dangerous move".
Syria" will not bow", he added with assurance that "competitions plotted against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "civil protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorably inclined to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime which, according to him, behaves "paranoidly".
The new Special Meeting of the League is convened for tomorrow in Rabat to take a stand on a plan to resolve the crisis decided on December 2, in which the withdrawal of armies from cities plagued by strife and the liberation of imprisoned manifestos was expected in particular.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov considered the Arab League's decision "mistake" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice for the Italians
The next Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti asked markets for a little time to form his team and start applying a program that will contain "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in Berlusconi's last months.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties before today meeting with representatives of trade unionists and employers.
It should assemble a relatively slim cabinet consisting of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many victims", said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in talks, after meeting with the design prime minister.
The President of the House of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to request Parliament's confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for time.
In "democracy, precise terms apply" as regards the preparation of the government and its programme, stressed and added that it is "sure that markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially favourably accepted by the markets, but the concern resurfaced after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed prime minister should put together a team involving chiefly technocrats, although he emphasized that he would like to adopt "politicians" into it.
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the next election date.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency after taking office and in order to make Italy a strong link again" of Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesperson stressed that, even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union believes that, despite the austerity plans made in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria business union Emma Marcegagli, who meets Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy"for a country that does not show growth cannot follow deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, "the professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, "a challenge to seriousness" and "another Italy", represents an "epochoal change" for Italy after 17 years" of Berlusconism".
The great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place government bonds for EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
A Soviet scientist helped Iran’s nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danienko helped Iran develop an atomic weapon detonator, reporting an American NGO specializing in atomic risks on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents leaked from this UN agency when identifying the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA announced its "serious concern" regarding the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, widely drawing from IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he had to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the blast method.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the Centre to set up a business in Kiev producing "nano-diamanty".
The economic difficulties of his company were intended to lead him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he would then cooperate on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In his latest IAEA report, he recalls "clear indications that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency about it, worked on this technology during a substantial part of its working career as part of the military nuclear programme of the country from which it came".
Anti-Muslim crimes and offences have risen 50%.
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and offences directed against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or little increased.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to the 13% approach for violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hatred crimes" rose very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences rise again", stressed Human rights First's human rights organization, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", added the organization in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds one of the leaders of the organization Paul Legendre.
"US government can and must do more to deal with these misdemeanors", adds and estimates that this could happen by improving police reports on "hatred crimes".
"A hate crime" in U.S. federal law is the legacy of a time of civil rights struggle.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now also sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The website providing microbloging services Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of followers, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New offers of "activity" and "name" enable you to better and directly know the activities of other people who are watching you or those whose answers ("tweets").
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor posts, whether they are entering new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested" to a small percentage of users in August" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, told AFP's Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated spread of someone else's contribution, followedfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ansi a un public plus large avec un maniament plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" assess the importance of this innovation differently.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it resembles Facebook too much", writes @jemb123.
"Function Activities will help me better follow some of the elements of my Twitter", sent by @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Enroling the Gold Rule on Balanced Budget in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided to enroll a "golden rule" of budgetary policy in the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid any reduction in Austria's ratings by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was socio-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of the ministerial meeting in a situation where Austrian public debt is, with its 74.6% high above the criterion, a maximum of 60% established by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than those of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by just one single step from AAA to AAA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more each year", argued Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows the request of the Euro Zone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State or Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the balance of public accounts be entered in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the 'German model', Germany was the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the federal government's public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to get public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty over the 2020/21 period.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention on foreign exchange markets
Japan's prime minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if only he had to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we have done last, if we find excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, explained to Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently broke the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has regularly been supported by purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in uncertain times of world economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar went back under 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of Japanese currency is damaging to island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues obtained by Japanese foreign companies when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan recovers" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami wave that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this expensive yen will not yet kill a fragile recovery in the egg.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% due to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households burdened by disaster.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
Japan's finance minister Jun Azumi called on Japan's Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures leading to the weakening of the yen.
But the multi-governor of this institution Hirohiide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" indicating that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Issues increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euro) and increased its ceiling to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) for purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
The euro area:
The rates are rising, the stock markets are failing.
The risk of a debt crisis still undermines European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European exchanges still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling into negative expectations today on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around euro area loan yields in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to yield only part of recent profits".
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection", explains Terry Pratt, a broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a drop of 0.7%, suffered due to concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan as well as the rest of the world has eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging to the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 in decline by 0.4%.
According to the currency brokers, after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU side adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday for the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries in difficulty without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of her debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the eurozone summit would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when elections to the House of Commons are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("Spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting euro area growth figures
Statistical figures say that France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% due mainly to household consumption in the third quarter, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downwards figures for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that concerns economists the most.
Germany registered growth of 0.5% from its side during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area are expected at 11:00, while the European Commission has just drawn attention to the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must triumph over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct effect on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that occupies energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will trigger a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of an important part of life.
At the same time, a lack of fossil resources will need to be faced in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case with Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which it considers appropriate to build only power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island plant crash.
If the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in an increase in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported mainly from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will experience all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which 30% of its electricity is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, making CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65% and 50%, respectively, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay our electricity invoice 40% higher than the payment made by French households.
While energy costs represent a key factor in the globalised economy’s competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the most cheap electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has allowed the sector to stand up to 125,000 direct jobs and 41,000 downstream jobs.
The strongly exporting sector is drawing a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad to international markets.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lost 6 billion euros a year, which the country receives for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer would be scheduled to decline?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, even that there is no devilish.
The development of low CO2 emissions installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA, is indicative of the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place under normal traffic conditions and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused reactor concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will take the lessons from this crash as it did in the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the competitors of AREVA and EDF and releasing the way to seize the leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view - the engulfing of police, courts and administration subjected to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights country", by which France boasts.
Recently it was administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of Interior (see the May 23 newspaper Libération) stated that France "does not need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at an economic angle.
It should be said that there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
To the right, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where 2 million immigrant workers are located" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of hordes by Polish plumbers on the French territory was shared on both the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as burdens for the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are willing to provide to immigrants.
In its program, François Hollande limits himself to banality when it states that joint development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exception People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and harms employment.
The concerns about the effects caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more supplemental than substitute for French employees by performing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
A Positive Effect on Wages
Like a surgeon, he will have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants cause immigrant arrivals to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
It does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalised immigrants among US Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries on average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany one immigrant arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at the beginning of his mandate of wishing to go for the missing percentage of growth" with priced teeth".
The teeth mentioned to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, there is a European democracy to think about
Democracy is rare and very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember this, even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece during the XXth century.
Some people could have believed that it would be enough to make a choice and make it as direct as possible for democracy to triumph over its enemies.
But it is known from Napoleon that it was easy thinking.
General suffrage, although a necessary condition of democracy, is not a condition sufficient and can become a "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control by power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just like that and since the beginning of the crises of politics and democracy.
The admission of the error of the Greek referendum type yes-no will have the value of double disclosure in this regard: revealing the need for a great return to political power, but also revealing the disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganised.
A blank exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a leap with tied legs into the void of nationalist depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would no longer know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe bowing to the dictation of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated internationally.
We are alarmed at the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it every one of its peoples.
The management of the European democratic sovereignty project must be urgently returned.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to get rid of the rule of the markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will anticipate decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European building.
To form a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
The revolution in interest couldn't be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards spread
In an optimistic atmosphere, on Tuesday at Villepinte near Paris, the world trade fair of chip cards will open.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones) on more than 6 billion units.
The most supporting is the segment of contactless technology that allows to pay in public transport or to deal with purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should continue to rise in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After long on the APEC tow countries, Europe gains terrain in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard contactless cards this year.
To rank a higher gear, from now on, banks need to equip their clients.
"Two large French businesses committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their clients in the future", announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test cell phone payments
But this is only the first stage to the payment means of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for transactions is now equipped with only a small number of instruments.
"They've taken on delays".
"But their real boom should take place next year".
"For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world to 80 to 120 million units", explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing for the advance.
Crédit agricole Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test conducted in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
iPhones of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, Société générale announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay by cell phone without contact.
The terrorist front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are ties between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had been "sure about this from now on".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them", he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help to illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers in an operation conducted by special French troops.
In rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of calls made leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian woman who has long resided in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and sect.
"It's progress, but no doubt we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram".
"But it's possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is manifesting itself increasingly actively", temperate statements by Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same kind of design as those used by AQMI.
The international community has since exerted pressure on Nigeria to consider the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little worthy interest.
Fast Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalists Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "western education is a sin", approves the founding of the Islamic Emirates in Muslim north Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a union has a rapid success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters begin the fight against the 'central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and authorities.
In 2009, supporters of Boko Haram became extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government's response is still the same as usual.
The army surrounds the city and results in 800 dead.
Founder of the Mohammed Yusuf sect is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group radicalizes and abandons its assignment in the north.
At Christmas 2010, Jos will assassinate 80 people, then another in Abuja, the capital.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks police headquarters in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned about all security specialists.
Now that the Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the iger and Somalis from the Al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "pass all information".
The world according to candidates for president
On issues related to China, Iran, or to helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are predating in simplisticity and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have repeated the outrageous statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or aid to Israel blend in.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican "Grand Old Party" nomination race, has threatened the Chinese's occupation before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "because of their currency manipulation", a supporting theme in America, with the rampant migration of entire parts of its industry towards Asia.
The worse, if this must involve triggering a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost got stuck in an attitude that "suppresses" emotions.
He demanded a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (president Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is in the last place in the polls, remains incorruptible.
In President Reagan's image
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop his nuclear program.
"If elected, I will arrest Iran", he declared in fanfaronian.
"If Obama is reelected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his duties toward this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, proves the embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, because Beijing's "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send the U.S. Army to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against supposed terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from Republican candidate John McCain, heavyweight in foreign policy in 2008.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, thus assigning him a label of the weak
But the attack isn't easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to entanglement.
And with arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking to the right place.
Nord Stream, a new Russian gas entry port to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
They must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
Over 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, participated in the Nord Stream inauguration last Tuesday, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together by controlling the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas will start flowing into Western Europe every year with the first 1 224 km pipeline connecting the region of Saint Petersburg with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomorany.
The second pipeline to be completed at the end of 2012 will allow the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the whole of French consumption.
And it is already mentioned the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom early completion of this huge structure has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being run on the ground by a third State (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing somewhat of power: the possibility of pushing Russia through threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it most strongly when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with an appeal to the Hitler-Stalin alliance in the 1939 occupation of Poland.
It means saying that it is a subject of political sensitivities.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created cracks between Europeans from east and west.
Russia has barely been able to assert its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that links us organically", François Fillon confirmed during the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated the point at which large gas contracts of things are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel fitted with a concrete casing to protect it from anchors of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, minefields originating in World War II had to be avoided.
"Because of security, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed", says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline itself is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffelek, which is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations anywhere on its entire length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see the Russian state company permanently settling off their coasts.
"In case of a malfunction, we stop gas passage in less than 1 minute", explains Jens Müller.
In the event of leaks, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by builders, for welds were designed to create leaks once every 100,000 years.
An offshore pipeline control is carried out by an underwater ship-drawn robot, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
In the target, it will provide accurate information on any deformations of metal parts throughout the three days of the journey at a speed of 3 m/s.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
Circulation of gas is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazproma, which holds a 51% stake, remains the leader.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in the town of Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased to the company for five years by a contract that can be renewed, all its gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will have a profit from total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported", explains Jens Müller.
Funding for pipeline construction was provided by 30% shareholder and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs thus rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will come back to them, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves of 4.5 meters high form the exit gate of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - designer notebook
The Italian firm Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to give again the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent writing in the candlelight.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular plates and its white leaves as if aged over time.
After all, Moleskin's notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at that time to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes up the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old "moleskin" production technique (skin imitation), which is used for example for surface treatment of benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to popularity an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XXth century", relates Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a remote secret production from the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile an artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook impresses the businessman as well as the student or professional.
The image of Moleskine's notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured, and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early years, has had almost a hundred of them today and has had two offices since 2008, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York City.
He sends his notebooks to a bookstore and through a chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the middle of cities where he could assert his identity.
"We watched the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened an exhibition" Conservation", where architects or artists display their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also introduced new records of a notebook reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand extends to a variety of carriers.
The success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe's investment funds, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of handicapped workers so high?
Around 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
Today opens 15th week for employing handicapped people.
Despite the voluntarist public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed handicapped people is even more than the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is that depressing?
"No, underscored by Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt Association, who organizes Week for employing disabled".
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable".
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed were not twice, but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be said that for unemployed disabled people, numerous obstacles persist before their entry into work.
These are elderly: 37% have more than 50 years (17% average).
They have low qualifications: 80% have no graduation and out of 2.3 million college students there are only 10,000 handicapped.
Finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for handicapped versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, founded in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that certainly develop, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité Association found that interviewed managers have" a weak level of knowledge about handicapped persons" s" an exaggerated idea of people in a mobile chair and mental or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employing 6% of the handicapped workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The most recent known figures dating back to 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, charged with levying charges from businesses that fail to comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of" fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 more guilty enterprises to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 Act, which raised contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc".
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before Tuesday night (20h45) they invite French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that will bring them this friendly match.
We're not going to go so far as to write that there was an association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stands of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled in short.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his advances, even with the fact that he loves his country".
"I want to move forward", assures French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches," it is one and the same, he justifies himself."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Gambling, investigated against Romania on Thursday night due to this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "blow".
The term "joy" cannot be ignored.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their victorious campaign in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more, because opposite" are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", recalls.
"We've cruised right away."
"The power to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Kindly Leekens recalled even "proudness".
"Proudness" to fight out" match - a holiday".
"Proudness" also stated in the quality of"neighbors", that France became a team of very high levels a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna" again".
"Laurent Blanc did a tremendous piece of work", exhaled.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French heading... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians become great", he underlined.
"We're building something right now, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next match." Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts this Wednesday in Lisbon with a great optimism of the barring against Bosnia (22h00).
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. Portugal’s football representation, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes apart from happiness.
One game left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Bearing in mind Friday's result (0–0) in Hell Bosnian Zenice, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of superiority, but was unable to give such a rare goal that would relieve him.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score a goal outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of an audience that should create a boiling boiler there, although the match certainly appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but a keen thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand", said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance to be on Euro 2012", relativized yet the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An indistinguishable match can suffice for Bosnians who also need to score a goal.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score a goal outside", regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and which has players with large individual quality", he added.
Just like in Zenici, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that they don't give them time to think."
A good idea, on the condition that it turns out realistic this time.
