What will they do? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the sugar shop
The new ČSSD councillors will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old ODS colleagues on the Prague Council and in the council.
Diary Aktuálně.cz "Tested" members of the new council from ČSSD, as they know the notoriously established slang, which originated at the city hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political elite during the previous era by Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, new councillors have shown little understanding of known concepts.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a rookie in Prague politics," he responded to the test of the "Godfather" vocabulary of the Councillor for Culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And while he is a political veteran, so did Councilman Karel Brezina.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you give me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I generally don't recognize slang."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz this June before the ODS electoral congress, the editors selected six examples, mainly those notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort", "largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the candy store", "bull's neck", "the treason of the capital" and "to breed".
Three councillors agreed to the quiz, fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to lead Prague education in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth Alderman Petr Dolínek just rejected the test.
"I don't care about these things at all, and I'm not going to judge the way the citizens' Democrats are having fun."
"I am now dealing with how we will understand each other within our programmes," he responded.
As has already been said, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have known in the headline above that there is talk of an influential businessman and friend of expressor Bém Roman Janouškov.
"Voldemort" doesn't ring any bells to Kauckém, and the only term he correctly estimated in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, adding, "But I'm more familiar with that from the newspaper."
"I'll have to pay for some language course," he jokes.
As the Blanka tunnel, the golf hole is decoded not only by matador Karel Brezina, but also by environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Luke Placham is familiar with where to find this character - the meaning of the term "go to the candy store" is unknown.
"I think that means going to some Prague business," is Plachý near deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
He also reminds Březina that he drew knowledge from the newspaper rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the participants of the test, there is no similar run-of-the-mill slang vocabulary.
"I've also consulted my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call each other by names, sometimes abbreviations and combinations of names are used," says Prague ČSSD chairman Petr Hulínský, whom the parties dubbed Huld.
"At school I was called Bříža, but I don't know if colleagues call me that," Karel Brezina confesses to his own nickname.
Diary Aktuálně.cz tried the name and it works.
Alderman Weinert is for the party of Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the election by fraud in party sponsorship, has the nickname "Igraček" in some colleagues.
Aliases are also the only thing the Social Democrats admit in intra-party language.
Hulínský is said not to be happy with Huldu, but the journal Aktuálně.cz also recorded another nickname for this Prague chairman.
"Doctor of baton law" is said to recall that Petr Hulínský won his degree as JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", published a brochure
Women reported in Burkina Faso as witches have several common characters.
They belong more to the older generation, cannot engage in work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who "becomes a witch" is sent to isolation to avoid endangering the rest of the village.
"A man can rarely make this fate."
"Even young healthy women don't move away because they help at work and give birth to children," describes the order nurse who, in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso, took care of more than a hundred women in a special house who were expelled from their ranks by their community.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure."
She published an information booklet that should help limit the witch hunt.
But here's the thing.
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso can't read," pointed out the disadvantage of the written education daily Die Standard.
Sorcery charges are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which is adjacent to Burkina Faso, a 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured kerosene and set on fire.
The BBC server reported the case.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was ignited by oil used for ritual anointing.
It was said to have flared up after the group wanted to "exile evil spirit" from a woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
Diary Der Standard cited 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the witch hunt tries to moderate the government, in Gambia last year the President himself participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammí, after his aunt's death, unleashed large-scale witch hunts, which allegedly were to participate in her deaths and try using black magic to kill the president himself."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who accompanied police officers, soldiers and personal security of the President violently took randomly selected men and women from Gambi villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, trapped people had to drink a potion from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakala's tenant: He's drowning in the stove, higher rent signed
The older stocked man stepped out of the door of the client center of RPG Apartment "uhlobarona" Zdenek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried the file and in it a new lease contract to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the penalty.
All three of them just got their rent up.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for the apartment 2+1 next year.
"And there's no hot water and a petrama has to be drowned," the man points his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has the power of attorney.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease terms "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December to publish a guide on how to proceed against them.
But a man is just waving his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic are waiting.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG's Havířská waiting room is one of four in total on Ostrava, and it's already full at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
There's a security guard standing right next to the door from the security agency, and there's a launcher on it.
"Hire 2011", a special button on his touch screen is lit.
One tap, and a numbered piece of paper comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your cipher is already beeping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're up in half a second.
An older married couple comes to ask about the rent after a while, but apparently the surge in the waiting room is not related to the new rents.
Most people have come to deal with common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance events, etc.
Letters with new lease contracts are received by tenants of most of the 44,000 RPG portfolio flats in the mailboxes in Ostrava from around mid-November.
RPG Flats suggests an increase in rent of 15 to 38 percent in letters to them.
A special counter for new rents was opened at the client center on 18 November.
"It runs over a week, so it's just a run-in," answer the worker behind the counter after a while of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining flats are a local hot topic.
Prior to the election, he was seized by the deputy parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek of ČSSD, and even now the local newspaper is full of him.
"Twenty years I've been asking them for a new floor."
"They didn't even change the toilet record," he says in the introduction.
According to the workers, the most seniors come to see if they will get a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as the RPG promises in the special offer.
Half discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The Havířská "deregulation" bulkhead but the questions are certainly not overwhelmed.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, there were only about forty to fifty people here for rent in 2011,," estimates the workers behind the counter.
At the same time, RPG proposes individual contracts where necessary on the web and its walls.
However, if the rent is not agreed by both parties, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about only a possible and entirely legitimate legal procedure," notes RPG on its site.
"There will be no trial here," thinks one of the RPG Apartment workers and the man on the street outside the client center partially gives her the truth.
"I have 13,000 pensions and I have $5,000 left to eat, I don't have the guts to sue," he says.
After all, the worker will be disquieted.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Flats, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The permanent rent is still below even the amount needed for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of RPG Flats' residential portfolio, that the very angry tenant accused of neglect of the housing fund, according to homeowners, is the main reason for the increase in rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest in flats four billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats several red highlighted information.
"Increasing rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31,200 flats, this is over 90% of RPG flats".
"And it will always be at most 7.50 CZK per square metre and month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 flats in the RPG portfolio will increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square metre," notes RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Flats promises that deregulation will not drive out rents jump, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see chart) will be put back in apartments, mainly in thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
They are to be given priority by people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices include kindergarten, architects understood
The Avriopoint administration building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a minischool with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
Arch.Design, whose studios produced a number of important Brno buildings, has counted on the space for its corporate minischool since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom and cared that women designers and architects could quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of abbreviated work, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding jobs with child care.
The minischool was invented by employees of Arch.Design themselves and with the support of leadership they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The corporate minischool is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant financing (subsidisation of CZK 2, 8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operation for two years.
After the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design has an obligation to operate a minischool at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the application for a subsidy was significantly helped by Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, children are taken care of daily by a nurse and a teacher of the school, so children can attend kindergarten without age limit, yet most of them are over 3 years of age.
Since it is a "minimum school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but even more will be replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the minischool is comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic recognition to preparation to school benches, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time, and stress situations with delayed picking up children from kindergartens away from their parents ’ work are falling apart.
Thus, parents use working hours more productively.
No wonder there is a naturally loyal employee - employer relationship.
Arch.Design thus ranked with Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program boosted personnel marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Check the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the Casa Batlló house in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house earned the nickname House of Bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, facade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all typical of Antoni Gaudí's Art Nouveau.
The front of the house is played by dream lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In a detailed observation, geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order can be seen.
At night the entire facade of houses sounds even more dramatic, it is lit so that the impression of the gloss of colors is even enhanced.
The winding and twisting of shapes appear equally in the interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peepers and rails.
The Batlló House, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the rebuilding of the 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea for unusual and cheaper rebuilding.
The Casa Batlló apartment house was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
He was co-operated by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade were created on his design board.
A number of other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
Joint work on Casa Batlló's designs started with successful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and the park Güell, in which there are other Gaudí's works.
From the locals soon to completion, the house earned the nickname "House of Bones" due to its organic shapes.
Others began to call it a "drowning house" because of the specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia, is at the top of the building.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the structure.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys for his time.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five-degree inclination.
In the creation of Gaudí, he did not completely respect the construction regulations of that time and did not allow them to bind him.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the figures on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, the city council was horrified by the result and demanded correction.
The council, for example, resented the fact that the construction interfered with the pillar and the public sidewalk.
The correction never happened, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the challenge of the city section, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to lower floors.
There was a social salon in the gallery on the second floor and a bedroom on the third floor and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house intersects the staircase, which can be ascended to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all true angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the lounge doors and the larger society can communicate comfortably without retaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
Apart from the new facade, Gaudí's rebuilding house also acquired unconventional roofing and two additional floors.
Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles is also impressive, with which the interior courtyard is covered, and skylights.
The game of two colors adds maximum light on all floors of the house.
Simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun’s rays on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and luxurious apartment is made available to the public.
The owners chose this step only in 2002, on the occasion of celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They remained at the tours as they found it to be a very advantageous business and, moreover, extended the tours with common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is EUR 16.50 and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of the house with dragon turrets, you must quickly become friends with some of the residents of the tenement and visit it directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and grate: women have different requirements than men
Not a fancy bed frame, but the quality of the bed area, i.e. mattress and grate, give the foundation of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously supplemented to suit a particular user.
Many things, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner, decide when choosing.
The type of interior to which the mattress and grate are fitted is also important.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages where they don't drown regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they are slower "warming up".
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they don't have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they're still lying on a solid board, they hold moisture: even mold could appear under them.
The custom also decides when choosing.
Who has spent longer time abroad, where they often use a very high mattress with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel comfortable on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players returning from the NHL have complained to me that they will not sleep here."
"On their battered shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misrepresent "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
For many hockey players, but also for other customers, she was looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's OK, suitable mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL guy to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracles" works simply.
Optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
There's nothing pushing you, you won't turn around at night like you did after a tough game.
You'll just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as protection against bedsores.
When selecting the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Both a man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for the double bed, so 180 cm in total.
For single beds, such as singles, at least 120 to 140 cm are recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for bed width is simple: when lying on your back you should have hands comfortably shrug in your elbow," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, Cechmaster of Cech upholstery and decorators, who has been studying the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years.
With a double bed each needs its own grate and mattress, but here be careful when buying to align mattress heights.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left to do but install grates in different heights, but you may not be able to do that at every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres are counted on a forming and raising layer.
"When touching hands or touching a mattress, you must not feel springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Full-length beds, where mattress and base are like conjoined siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses don't air well, they can't be washed, which is common today.
And since we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in the night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses for up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its own buts.
Therefore, advice from retailers from practice: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up the washable coating, but rather add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are commonly produced today with slides all over the circuit, we get two parts (very important for washing and washing machine size!), still, handling in larger types (and in one person) when shooting could resemble a light weight match in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid board in bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum on the bed for one night visits.
However, store the plate (if it no longer has it) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it. Taschenfederkern) and a fluctuating layer.
A polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a foundation.
The non-positioning lamella grates with 14 to 18 lamellas will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always pay off grids with more lamellas, 28 or more, where the lamellas in the lumbar region are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
The positioning lamella grates do not include a spring skeleton mattress because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to setting the rigidity of the lamellas, you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special fixture of the lamellas that allows you to push or even tilt the lamella so that the shoulder of the sleeper "falls down nicely".
For men who have "arms over their backs", it's definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers, who in "men" started using the softening zone in the shoulder area.
Women are also remembered - they are given a softer surface in places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate grates with so-called multitorsion suspension.
Pressure breaks down into more points and reduces stress.
However, be careful, once you use the wrong pillow (big and "toughy") on the right mattress and grate, most "plus" disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips only interfere with the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
50 x 60 cm is recommended as a suitable size, which they prefer in Scandinavia for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance the height of the shoulder (together with the shoulder cradle of the grate or softened zone in the mattress) of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original straws filled with grass.
Indeed, their producers increasingly use natural materials or at least ingredients.
The trend is just organic with mattresses.
Oil raw materials from which polyurethane foams are produced are replaced by natural oils, for example, from cinnamon and soya.
It's soy that all known manufacturers use.
"Bio at mattresses means the core is made of purely natural material," explains Petr Vášíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also have microcapsules to release fresh scents of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men "cool" plant extract from birch to absorb heat and cool the body, women's covers "heat".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
The mattress made of cold foam (with larger pores with broken cell structure, is thus more breathable than common polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of various stiffnesses of cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, shoulders and heel should be.
You will pay for a quality mattress from about 7,000 crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters have a lower rate of VAT are taken as health aids.
Gumotex was the first to reach this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving money on a mattress and a grate isn't easy.
Sometimes it is possible to take advantage of the actions of producers or sellers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattress with a sewn memory foam Memory to cover for CZK 11,990.
However, the second can be purchased free of charge.
The era of lazy, or viscoelastic foam with open cell structure and high density started Tempur material at a "space" pace.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because at launches, astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
Tempur in the heat softens, in the cold it strengthens.
It perfectly adapts to the warm human body and decomposes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedsores, but also to increase sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet that lighten the foot and venous system.
Domestic producers use, for example, Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver foam, etc.
More and more parents want to watch people, so they want to keep an eye on their children.
Fear for their own child brings more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system originally created for looking for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox so far, but soon it can only be as big as clockwork.
A number of people were frightened by the missing Anička case and began to look for means to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not a spy, but another means of reducing the likelihood of any tragedy happening," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case such devices may be misused, such as when they are put in a bag to someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most of the customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, a child should always know what the box is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like this, she'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose things when they don't want to be under control."
"Big expectations had previously triggered mobile phones in parents, which, however, can be turned off just like these tracking devices," Bočková says.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such equipment would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the kidnapping is concerned, the perpetrator practically always ensures that the child has no electronics that might reveal its location."
"Now it's a phone."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will also be looking for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that a similar device can help in the event of sudden pedophile attacks.
According to Robert Čech, from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, even if an immediate destruction of a tracking device occurs after the attack, its presence may help.
"Equipment may be set to be sent periodically after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"Dearer devices have built-in and tiltometers, so even if one just slipped and remained motionless, the machine will immediately send a warning with a positioning," says Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service can be carried out by smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with current surveillance units is that they are either devices similar to matchbox size pendants or smaller mobile phones.
It's always the risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why the device now looks like a common digital watch is being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in that a potential aggressor may not recognize a tracking device at all".
"Or she won't recognize them until after a while and that can give the police extra time," she adds.
Whether the tracking devices develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology as used to watch cars.
This is a combination of GPS positioning (which uses common autonavigation) and mobile phone functions that report the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would wrap the Czech Republic.
The Czech army purchased 445 kilometres of cords to detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence already added 224 kilometres of cord to the warehouses.
The military thus has provisions for 225 years.
The problem is, the life of the cords is two, four years tops.
The army bought incendiary cords from the stock STV Group, a.s. for CZK 40 million.
In order to justify the purchase of such a huge amount of incendiary cord, the General Staff wrote back today that soldiers consume 60 kilometres of incendiary in training each year.
However, it follows from the calculations of military pyrotechnics, addressed by MF DNES, that then all generals, military command officers, secretaries and cleaning women would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training each year.
Minister of Defense Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick, including.
That's the only way to justify an army's annual consumption of 60 kilometers of incendiary.
That length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, military supplies would be enough for more than a decade.
On the contrary, if it were sufficient to train every new professional to the basic training of each new professional at least two meters of incendiary cord, as experts say, the army has provided fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of the engineers or special units - supplies for the aforementioned 225 years.
The rapid deployment brigade's troops recently complained to Minister Vondrovi personally that they had almost no ammunition for handguns, so shootings due to the need for money are also limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't get it, either, that they're buying so many matches from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what it's for."
"For us, the military is a good customer, to whom as businessmen we try to accommodate," says STV Group's business manager Jan Děcický.
Defense Department spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of miles of purchased line even by the military having supplies of this "municipality" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcický of the STV Group, however, only talks about the four-year life of the incendiary and police or army pyrotechnics even about two years.
"It may be the four in perfect storage," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish the name because of the military's criticism.
After the end of life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers on life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantity discount on 445 kilometres of incendiary cord.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty kilometers," says Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of police pyrotechnics firing lines that dispose of World War II ammunition or here after the Soviet army has not exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police only order enough to consume this ammunition before the end of life.
It proved to her because of the safety of pyrotechnics, and can also gain more flexible modern and therefore more reliable types of lines.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the 2000-th Czechoslovak army was preparing to campaign on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnics, addressed by MF DNES, is facing the same problem in a few years: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometres of old incendiary, which it is "cheaping" today.
To this day, I draw from the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Tradesman of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytlouno in the sale of the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's competition Živnostník of the Year was the twenty-eight-year-old businessman Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using bank credit, he bought a semi-destructed house with five apartments.
For a third-year college student at the time, that was a lot of courage.
"That time the ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation with us did not give me a chance to do anything about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began renting foreign workers.
All profit invested back in the house, which gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently a four-star Baggins design hotel.
This year, however, he added another, equally good quality.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov near Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Sackon Hotel franchise are applying," says last year's number one businessman.
"And in this sale of the license to operate the hotel, it was a victory in the Tradesman of the Year competition," he adds.
The victory brought him more familiarity and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me additionally, and I must say it was pleasant," he recalls.
It certainly recommends participation in the competition to all those who are trying to do something.
There's no need to win, any visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances that he may not be able to get to.
"I started to do business regularly with some of the people I met thanks to the competition."
According to him, the fame associated with success has affected every employee.
And he's got about 70s.
"I care for greater loyalty and pride in their involvement in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is put in the foreground," says Luke Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet.
Euphoria from victory quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goalfulness of the winner, however, Farmet has been through worse times.
Last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, came for the first place award in the previous year's Vodafone Firm of the Year competition.
The jury then appreciated the effort, through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers from a small tool shop in Česká Skalica.
"I can say that the award encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and increased our confidence for a match with competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
So, when the state offered Karl Žďárský's father a small workshop to rent as compensation for the Communists' confiscated property, he did not hesitate long, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his dad they established a company on plastic baths.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Even among the unprofessional public, the company gained greater awareness after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have begun to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in its country," says Karel Žďárský.
However, the past year was not only in Farmet as a sign of euphoria from the victory.
The award was based on the company's economic results until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the hardest year for the sale of engineering goods.
It has culminated in a crisis that has not yet affected citizens so much, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to limit the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"This situation, of course, has not been avoided by us either."
"The market has fallen by 40 percent, we have had to reduce production and it has occurred to layoffs," Karel Žďárský explains.
A viable firm has to be able to take such unpopular measures at times.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
But what Farmet has not been relieved of is investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from subsidies, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won major awards in domestic exhibitions," Žďárský says.
All indications are that the crisis is over.
Sales are growing again and so are the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A poll that removes meaningless regulations
The poll on Absurdity of the Year is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some pointless regulations have already been abolished.
The infamous winner of the next year's poll Absurdita of the year became an obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voters decided.
For example, social security management required a paper statement from the Commercial Register, although an official can get it by two clicks of a mouse.
The poll's gonna change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a statement from the Commercial Register during inspections with insurance payers," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraniová.
To look at all the regulations and regulations that firms and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and to abolish them is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth part of the business competition organized by Economic News this year and is increasingly popular among the public.
If there were about three thousand voting last year, there were nearly four thousand of them this year.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal responsibilities that serve only to delay business, there's still enough and enough.
"We are at the top of the world in the number of registrations for tax award," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has in recent years become the stated goal of all governments.
However, the situation is not particularly improving in the Czech Republic compared to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed 74th in terms of terms for business, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdita of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same script.
Anyone can sign up for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the deadline of the competition is.
To sign in is the web address www.firmaroku.cz Then the organizer selects seven candidates for the "anticene" and lets the public vote on it during October via the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihend.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred were entered into this year's poll, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations lacking meaning.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, the nominees found themselves required to pay tolls for the maintenance of motorways and expressways, or for businessmen with 20 employees, two offices, and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven designs is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which regularly participates in the personality of political and social life.
Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Economics of the Czech Republic, assisted for example this year.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws sticks at entrepreneurs' feet, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which make business more difficult today," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The attempt to break senseless orders doesn't sound empty.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by the amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voiced obligation in 2007, which was to report the employment office for its foreign employee on a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the Green Card Act.
And a third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 became the order of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two scales in the office.
This was eased this year by the Ministry of Health decree - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen off.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are being evaluated.
A new feature in this year's fifth edition of Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a sensible and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impacts of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the rebel competition of the year.
In this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year 2010, companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspirational and would publish on a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities differs diametrically from the other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, for example, it concerns disabled people and others, such as personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, the Prague software firm Et Netera found herself among the fourteen nationwide finalists, supporting the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the responsible company from Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the foundation fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
In turn, a paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent, takes care of its disabled employees and therefore has won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, ranked third in the county.
MiRyz Soft, an accounting firm that introduced flexible working hours, won Olomouc, also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The title was also awarded by the jury for the fact that it primarily buys from Czech producers, supports civic activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration can have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains Miluše Ryznar.
The responsible IT firm Enlogit from Ústí Region thinks about the health of its employees and for each laptop it has got ergonomic chairs and keyboards, supports their work from home and at its corporate events uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the representative of Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of Praní and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their pension insurance to its employees in the form of premium bonuses.
"We also give contributions to food, transport, higher qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč of the Brno construction firm Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All the regional finalists of the Vodafone Firm of the Year were automatically entered into the category Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrectly filled out or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firm did not answer questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"Separate entry to this competition is not possible, as it is a subcategory of the main competition Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose organizing agency.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested in a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Pilsen in the past days, the anti-corruption police arrested.
The iron detectives put on a local businessman in the media sphere and a realtor Luboš G.
He allegedly attempted to manipulate the currently ongoing public competition to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would acquire specific candidates.
He was supposed to pay Lubosh G. half a million crowns for it.
"I can only confirm that the police prosecute one person for misdemeanors in the public contract and in the public competition," said the Attorney General of Pilsen, Antonia Zelené, saying that further details can not be provided with regard to the ongoing investigation.
The 46-year-old businessman was released by police officers after 24 hours.
The way he could influence the competition can only be speculated about the minimum amount of official information.
A spokesperson for the Lubomíra Černá Land Fund on the question Law said that police officers actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen during a public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she specified.
According to Black, the public competition has the correct name "A call to tender claims for land transfer under the Land Act" and takes place when more eligible applicants show interest in the property offered.
"These persons within the challenge offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land".
"According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the Fund's spokesperson explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who signed up for the challenge, and since he himself is also a legitimate person, since he purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered the interested party the land that he would not participate in the competition.
He probably paid severance for it.
That would explain why he had such a large amount of money in his detention.
Luboš G. had high standard contacts at the PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was being prosecuted for issuing land in a substitute restitution, on which a decision on the location of the building has already been made.
It was then that Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the driveway was to be built to the industrial zone Borská poles.
Later it was very advantageously exchanged with the Magistrate for a house in the historic centre of the city itself, which was worth much higher.
At the time, the city hall had to accept it because otherwise, blocking the land would endanger the construction.
Housing households will pay extra hundreds a month
Households will have to pay extra for all kinds of energy from January onwards, but also for water and bilge, heat supplies and rents will increase.
Families will have to pull up hundreds of crowns from their wallets each month more than they do now.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, until you have to pay a tenth in some cities for water supplies and often also undermine central heat supplies.
Electricity management should cost households in apartments a year by a hundred crowns more than now.
At the same time, all major suppliers have reduced the prices of power electricity, so the rise in support of the production of renewable energy, especially photovoltaic energy, is significant.
Although gas will cost slightly, at a time when people are drowning the most and have the highest consumption.
It must therefore also be counted with hundreds of crowns per year.
While electricity and gas will cost more throughout the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about CZK 50 per month for central heating from January onwards, more than CZK 1000 per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague also threaten to raise more than 9 percent of their water and bilge rent if the city increases the rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, they'll pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be in the nationwide comparison between the lower ones.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it is expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices in 450 thousand rental apartments may increase significantly, where regulations have ceased since January.
For example, CPI Flats, which owns about 2500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to 100 percent from January onwards.
Those who do not agree with the new rent level are going to put the company on trial.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300,000 apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, performs slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which drinking usually ends in the care of doctors drunkards, which were not even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from monkeys in the hospital.
This results from the experience of physicians who encounter similar cases on the incomes of children's wards of hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk."
"Trendem is definitely hard alcohol," said the Law Chief of Children's Department Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia Luděk Pelikán.
"If they can pull a bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's whiskey, otherwise it's fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into their juice and not feeling so much," the chief explained.
And the spokesperson for Motol University Hospital Eva Jurinová also gives him the truth.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol nowadays, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice brought from home," Jurinová said.
According to Chief Pelican, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers on hospital income are a fairly common phenomenon.
Prior to Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked in pediatrics in Motol for ten years, where ambulances carry subtwined schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl lay in our house about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 extra alcohol in the blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at a fairground in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the Chief of Medicine wondered.
It is the parents’ lack of interest or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring that is considered the main cause of growing child drinking.
However, according to experts in children, addiction can not be discussed in the true sense.
"The term alcoholic means several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all phenomena that belong to it, and that is not in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more typical of a failed family-social background," explained Chief Pelican.
According to Jurinová's spokesperson at the pediatric clinic in Motol this year, they hospitalized roughly forty drunk children by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children’s drunks, who take their parents after outpatient treatment, or the police bring them home, do not count.
Except when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, according to Pelican, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: witches, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"They either drink grief from a bad report card, or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course, I have experienced seven children's drunkards at the same time," Pelican said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at the advantage of the one who suffers from an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will prevent an irrigation infusion with glucose and nutrients missing from the body.
"They're actually better off because they have a good evening's experience and a good awakening, and nothing hurts them."
"Only they are confused about where they are," Pelican admitted, saying that he occasionally spoils patients' moods by at least taking account of the costs that their treatment required.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational means, when I was directly counting on the kids' rounds how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to earn for that one party," Pelikán added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not approach regression procedures in which parents would recover treatment costs in the case of child drunkards.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft of a total of five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Spanish Seville on Tuesday, where the Casa - EADS aircraft manufacturer resides.
It is the first time machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they've only been on exercise or demonstration flights abroad.
These are two-digit versions of L-159T1 which have been operated by the Czech army and which have been able to fly.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
So far, these stand preserved in Aero Vodochody and the trade broker - Omnipol company - took over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek of the Press Department of Defence, it is not yet known when the aircraft are physically dispatched from Vodochod.
"L-159 single-site aeroplanes for shift have been set aside from long-term stored aircraft, without additional deposits and investments by the Ministry Department."
"The two-digit L-159T1s were changed in the current state and form," he said to the Law of Pejsek.
He added that the army would not stay without two-seater aircraft because the Ministry signed a contract worth CZK 200 million with Aer Vodochody in May 2009 to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS undertook to force aircraft into the armament of some alliance country.
"It is clearly stated in the contract that the L-159 aircraft are purchased by EADS and will serve to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter for the purchaser to see how this matter will be implemented," Pejšek said.
The Hospodářské noviny reported some time ago that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 per Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other CZK 3.5 billion aircraft was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not put out a tender for purchase and addressed the EADS directly.
The then defense leadership argued that by innings it would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
Buying Casa planes will probably have a court run.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it should have selected aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing one producer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely Airport within a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger indicates lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than a ring finger are at less risk of becoming ill by prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Magazine.
It could be related to the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under the age of 60," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burdens, supplied by Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed with colleagues in Britain over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and concurrently over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring finger.
They had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
However, in the case of those who had an index finger longer than a ring finger, this risk declined by 33 percent, even 87 percent for men under the age of 60.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone matches the longer index finger.
Earlier research has shown that testosterone promotes growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former President of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes said for CTK that he knew this study briefly, but he does not seem to think that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer was "completely proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and pedestrians lie mostly driven snow, roadmen in many places rode all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and stands also D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The Central Motor Club dispatcher (ÚAMK) told the news.
There was a truck crash at the 91st mile, two trucks crashed at the 93rd mile, an accident required injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 kilometres in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should ride just behind Brno at 190th kilometer or drive through Brno and then drive to 182nd kilometer at Kývalka.
There are a few kilometers of columns forming.
Also on the D11 motorway there is an accident, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a multi-centimeter layer of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
The motorcades of cars are formed on Prosek, for example, and are clogged by Štěrboholská.
The surest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
At 8:00 a.m., the Prague crisis crew is scheduled to sit again.
Railways and airports also face problems.
České dráhy already had to cancel seven express connections due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. at night until 5 a.m. to morning.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already mobile, but only with caution.
There are three impassable side roads in Vyškovsko, in Brno there are snow tongues and in Blansko there are necessary snow chains to overcome some roads in the above places.
Vyškovsko was one of the most affected places.
So far there are closed paths: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
The cutters will have to be put on until they are stretched.
When they're cleared, there's no way to estimate.
In Hodonínsk, caution is required in the White Carpathian region.
On roads, which are only maintained by inert sprinkles for conservation purposes, there lies a five-centimeter layer of snow, CTK said.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimetres of snow fell most in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian Region, about 15 centimetres of snow fell.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually ceases.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the codename XM-25.
Generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the Taliban conflict there and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a little super-precision cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm-caliber rounds, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosive explosives, effectively operate as small grenades.
Bullets can be programmed to explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
Thus, they can be used against an enemy who hides behind some obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
Usually, the top is not protected, and if the murderous rain of steel fragments falls on it, it can take it out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to it, determining the distance, thus gaining a specified deliberate point, adjusting the scale and pressing the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun will charge and launch the missile at a distance of 543 metres plus minus one, two or three metres," said Audette.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their job in July next year from the existing administrative building to Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Fujitsu Japanese Group will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, said on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the present administrative building to Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to Fujist's spokesman, there should soon be another 100 jobs of the group that are still divided in the region.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and large space offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the working manner of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only in rent.
Competent executive Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central seat with excellent infrastructure".
An excellent airport connection is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important business within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
The economic executive in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this succeeded in winning "global players".
It is said to be a "fantastic expression of confidence in this locality".
Fujitsu is said to suit the city, settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was said to have been informed in time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the firm," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the problems of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property to Marienbader-square.
Economic reasons were crucial in the outcome.
Now this is about avoiding a long absence at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The Rathaus-square house, which had so far used Fujitsu, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale", together with the other buildings on Marienbader-square were among the most discussed construction intentions of the spa town ten years ago.
Between the railway station and the town hall, a joint city project and a private designer was created, which was criticized for the massive construction of areas that previously served as a parking lot and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001, Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time, moved into the homes.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and were sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid after a year.
The Fujitsu-concern of Tokyo is referred to as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available to companies and also provides the necessary service.
The Rhine and Mohan branch is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu's most employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, with Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 sqm were rented in the Astro Park administrative building.
In the complex - its name draws attention to a starry floor plan, which is twenty years old, also houses a central union of electrical and electronic industries.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assango
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon's Internet service shut down the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened on political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is reported to be staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now searching for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol's wanted list, is to abstain from one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks no longer on Amazon server".
"Free speech in free country", activists announced by Twitter's short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, Amazon's internet company downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic dispatches to handle a high number of access to documents.
Using Twitter to explain Wikileaks to this step: "Fine - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with free speech, "then they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers conducted a search, posting CNN television stations based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, informing the British "Guardian".
"Former I would like Amazon to approach this step earlier, due to earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks", said the Senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries to avoid a platform in the use of servers.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, blatantly and ruthlessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the planet", said a statement by non-partisan senator.
"No responsible firm - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities due to suspected rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", a 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact place.
The Internet activist has always referred to investigations in Sweden as intrigues of his opponents.
A Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"Even there were challenges to the murder of Julian Assange".
Therefore, Assange rightly fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that a person be responsible for publishing on Wikileaks for treason be charged and executed.
In Canada, an advisor to the head of government Stephen Harper said on television - probably ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target aircraft".
Meanwhile, a verbal shootout broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridicious and absurd", that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently published spy calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more significant than its website".
The U.S. government is now examining extensively the security of its data banks.
A Special Officer was appointed Deputy Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, told the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "the necessary reforms in the structure", which are required after the release of news from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger for publication on Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
Ice cream university
The "Gelato University" at Bologna prepares ice cream confectioners for a better season.
The basic course for future ice creammakers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors arrive from around the world.
Where is the ice cream coming from, anyway?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech a little obsolete ice cream maker, produces cream according to all rules of Italian ice cream artist.
Gelataio removes the ice cream from the cooler, wipes it in the wafer and sells it.
To find out this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But those who want to learn more about ice cream will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, a manufacturer of ice cream machines set up an ice cream university to match the high Italian ideals of ice cream from his machines everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors arrive from around the world.
However, special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in their own ice cream factory are also offered for several days.
Some in their Midlife-Crisis long for a new career, others venture on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the movement of Slow-Food and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream factory in Kairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the Southern and patriotic cherry on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a great deal of romance."
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then cools it to four degrees.
He then turns the machine with a tap and flows pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the associate professor is covered with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns, getting carried away by the spirit of time to the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilizers - mostly natural products such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it collides and the customer eats ice grains.
Certain variations of basic matter are allowed.
It'll be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"Contributors will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbettes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with white-based ice cream that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa into a base for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now the participating course for ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them always produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the basic matter, with more or less vanilla flavours or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be performed with fruit-type ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - given the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnut.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only when the balanced mixture highlights the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, extra sugar is required.
Luciano removes the apparatus by which it determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers measure the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to count.
Ice cream production no longer requires as much physical exertion as before.
It does not only help the automatic production of basic material.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream mixture simultaneously into the cream and cools to minus temperature.
Despite all automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo soils himself and also his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when he gets out of control by a huge blender.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in Double Light
The European Food Authority, Efsa, is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered an independent institute to estimate the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well", said the head of Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
Head of the Efsa Expert Group for Genologically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another expert of Efsa have had a contract with the Ilsi Lobists Union for several years.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated decisively in the control regulations of Efsa for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizing Then.
The Efsa regulations are said to coincide with the Ilsi documents in whole paragraphs and thus bear the manuscript of the industry, which should be checked by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, the high manager from Efsa switched without additions or transitional time to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the personnel link between the EU and the industrial lobby control office, which has aroused interest both in the Ministry of Environment and EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for Ephsa are not required to have no contacts with industry.
But he has to prove them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a contract by lobbyists.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically altered plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that genetic plant reactions to environmental effects are not tested.
"We want to know what genetically altered corn will do in the field, for example", says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not prove reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, then how can they be found?", Then asks the prosecutor.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
A scientist has been studying genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical College in Zurich.
In this area, industry, as in the US, is now attempting to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not linked to groups.
Most studies that are critical to society are not published.
"Industry checks security research", Hilbeck believes.
Trace of Stones
Uli Gsell also acquired some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of a station in Stuttgart, a tuba on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the diggers arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar reduction in railway stations.
When construction was halted, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken to 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43.
He's secured several of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It spreads out: "Cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When he cut one, he smelled like smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
A trace of the stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all that was created during a car crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they broke into gravel or disappeared into a depot", he says in his office, a wooden box that was formerly a watchhouse.
He reports that they called him names and threatened him when in September, all the papers said he bought North Wing leftovers from a company that was doing demolition.
But he's been talking to S-21's opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he wasn't responsible for the demolition.
And now that it's happening, it's the most sensible thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21-enemies each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope to return it in the process of rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all over and dragged away what fit in the trunk and the trailer.
Stones of the Stuttgart dispute long ago turned into "backs" or like the edges of herb beds.
"This stone is really nothing special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political plug."
He gets into his field car and rides around his 20-cre kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted the study, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a rock lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's slowing down.
In the snow lies artistically worked sandstones.
"They once belonged to Marien-bridge in Dresden", he relates.
Sandman from the Elbe, yellow, warm, excited.
"My favorite rock."
We're on our way up through the woods.
It points to the pile: a red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And beyond.
"Nice travertine."
Once those blocks belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, a tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how stones used to be broken manually and transported using simple pulleys and bull carts, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were crushed."
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people and, in addition, a stoneworker, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the one who evaluates the leftovers.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
That's where they're gonna save the rocks.
The Struggle of Talents for High-potentials
There's a lot of people at the diner.
16 students press for salmon sandwiches, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University in Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with VW developers, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies try to compete for the smartest heads in the race, as well as the VW company, succeeding and betting on collaborating with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditorium, even before they reach the labour market and are interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of their students' success, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practical projects and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automobile group tries to acquire talent the next day.
One young lady in the personal department is handing out pens, gummy bears and VW logo plates.
It tells promising young talents about practice programs, student jobs, and suggests that they are going to the group.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig handles the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and figure out who would be nice as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Sell, is not unusual.
But the news is, there's so much openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a substantial professional project", Selle says.
The fight for fresh alumni will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long crowds of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract particularly highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data, the Union of German Engineers VDI remained unoccupied 40,000 engineering positions in October.
And according to VDI predictions, the so-called lack of engineers will grow even further.
Roman Dykta is going to be the audit and consulting firm of KPMG for talent hunting.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also see the KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
It will decide in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested parties will fly to the USA.
In the high potentials contest at universities, the Dykta says the laws are getting harder and harder.
"We want to distinguish ourselves from others with our Race."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like the talent hunter Dykta's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants of a similar event last year".
"Some will soon be finishing their studies and planning to apply for a job with us", he says.
In addition to direct address on campus, small and medium-sized companies are presented classically in the labour markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions".
"Like Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, head of Solarworld solar technology manufacturer's personnel department.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 listed positions on the company's website.
"It is currently difficult to occupy vacant seats."
"It's worth a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to practice or write a thesis in our country."
Solar specialist doesn't have expensive promotions.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Big Groups often can't offer it", says Stübe's personal department manager.
Money no longer plays a major role in finding work.
Flexible working time, child care or good practice are other decisive factors.
Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in one study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, he asks his colleagues how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and follows the framework conditions of employees.
The head of Stübe's personal department hopes that placement will bring her points with job seekers.
"I believe interested parties will be particularly informed about external assessments of potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employment Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make himself visible as an attractive employer leads through his own employees", he says.
It is technically called internal Employer Branding, i.e. promoting the employer on the market within his own employees.
"Satisfactory employees are the best envoys."
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will themselves advertise to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game", says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil wells
Over the following years, new oil wells will not emerge outside the coast of the US-College State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued an appropriate ban - and thus definitively cancelled earlier plans.
Also outside the Atlantic coast so far, new wells are banned.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar announced it on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled on the pressure of opposition and industry his willingness to allow new wells in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents are trying to reduce US dependence on supplies of oil from abroad.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The centre of criticism is the British energetic BP Group, which is confronted with billion-dollar requests.
The investigation committee commissioned by Obama should present the results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the ban on drilling that had been in effect since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies applied for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster through stricter controls and strict security regulations.
Currently, the Audit Office is being fundamentally reformed, which has drawn attention to itself by many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas groups.
Industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of Gulf oil being mined.
"Government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of gas and oil industries", the result of the current survey in the field by the consultancy company BDO - even before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what will change by regulation."
Investments in new mining projects are being moved until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni area of Nigeria.
People make a living stealing, corrupting, and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry", calms down the journalism environmental activist: "Today you get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who is wading on his breasts with water that surrounds the smudges: the scene works almost nicely in water gloss with rainbow colors.
The fact that brown oil clots float beneath the surface is not visible.
Previously there she collected enough garnel in the containers, telling Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetta River.
Meanwhile, slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil was spilled into a vast shallow area from a broken line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River delta, belongs to one of the worst infested areas in the world.
Along the river through mangrove marshes with many side tributaries, the whole range of the trigger is noticeable.
The engine on the boat boils brown mash instead of light water and whoever dips his hand in the water pulls oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black licorice sticks, rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves sadly hanging.
In vain, we search for flocks of birds that are commonly found in wet areas: As soon as the engine on the boat dies down, it melts in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, haunted silence.
"What's going on here is the environmental leadership of the war", says the sad Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear for health."
A comparison with the war is justified.
Ogoni's settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago the first conquerors from Europe came here, where in the 1980s the first resistance was formed with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while it is mined daily from the entire delta area of three-size Switzerland with more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of lead of more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoni region fallow, for the group the situation is too unstable.
Every few hundred metres of water rises a steel structure like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees", so they are called the heads of drilling holes too tenderly.
They're 50 years old, most to the core rusted.
Every now and then, the head of the drilling hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion gallons of oil flowed into the delta in 50 years: Every year as much oil flowed into the sea near Alaska in a supertanker crash "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes over who is responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While the Shell Group refers to sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists refer to crackling heads of wells and leaks as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, accused the Group in 2008 by US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of failures on the lines is said to be "a few times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance as abandoned, oil-stained workshop in the open sky, it emerges from the mangroves of the character: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly linked by leadership, partly arbitrary scattered across the ground, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
Oil warms up in a barrel over a fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, gasoline flows out of the lead into the trap pot, later dripping at the end of the kerosene line, and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four coworkers produce up to four barrels a day of 300 litres: "We earn about 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Delta residents use chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of EUR 40 cents per litre of diesel can still be overcharged by illegal producers: because they have free raw material.
It comes from the "bunkers" who connect to leadership everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million gallons of oil are lost daily in the entire Niger River Delta area.
But only a negligiblely small portion of the interim raw material will be illegally refined: The largest share will be filled by organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate whether the residents caused the disaster and their interventions or lax method of production is considered by the Akpobari activist to be purely academic.
"If oil companies were not regarded as intruders and if they had not so perfectly destroyed the life essence of fishermen, then there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
But in the meantime, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so degraded that only the group's departure is considered: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will turn out to be better."
Michael gets upset.
"The highest time for you to disappear", says the muscular manufacturer.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If a special military unit found them, they wouldn't be in jail, but a painful bribe.
Also soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has taken our land in every way to the bottom", says Akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous building error in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security glitch.
Investigators discovered during an emergency inspection of the machine that landed, a possible building mistake that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas Air Company wants to sue engine manufacturers.
The passengers of Qantas' airbus had probably had more luck on an emergency landing in early November than was known to date: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety glitch on the engines of some A380 machines during its investigations - and now warns of a possible building error.
A possible defect would have severe consequences: a single oil connection could cause cracks due to wearout, this Thursday, in a published statement by ATSB.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a statement of reasons for the action at the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas head Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released, and they damaged the loading surfaces.
Rolls-Royce referred to burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out additional safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
Security recommendations are the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough for all concerned to be informed.
After an emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a security measure.
A two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
The national snowfall will create chaos in transportation
Germany was all white: almost all over the country it snowed overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, train and aircraft connections are jammed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: almost all of the Republic has fallen in on Thursday night at freezing temperatures by snow - which leads in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east lies up to 15 centimetres of snow in some places.
On several highways and many roads there is heavily limited traffic.
On the A7 near Flensburg, road service was still on line, but it did not handle the newly-laden snow.
In addition, there was a strong shock wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy flood in Schlesvik-Holstein in the morning with a water level of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow wills caused considerable problems in Saxony on highways and state roads.
According to the bad weather headquarters of Metemedia, there was therefore a degree of purple alarm in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
In part, 30 centimetres of new snow fell, strong and fresh winds caused willows.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major difficulties on the roads.
On A2 the wind and snow caused slow traffic and traffic jams.
There was trouble in Thuringia due to snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German Railway, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
Remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
In Thuringian Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers received wool blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescuers on the train.
The snow winds were blowing across the road.
Many flights were cancelled at major German airports due to snow winds.
According to the spokesman of the flight information centre, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt, it has been cancelled for 40 years, according to Fraport's spokesperson.
Road maintenance is on constant deployment.
Although there are few passengers left at the airport without a connection, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
On many roads there were accidents already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in East Holstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road there was a similar accident near Nuremberg: also there was a truck caught at the railway crossing, because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning to a slippery road at Aschaffenburg with her car.
After all, meteorologists have good news: snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will also rise during light gusts of wind.
But the wind is getting weaker.
Only by the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds of storm power.
But it's going to be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for buyers for two towers with offices at the Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could cost up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its group's headquarters: the towers-twins in Frankfurt's banking district have upgraded; meanwhile, bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group seems to want the renovation costs back again - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, as it informs "Financial Times Deutschland" with an appeal to a spokesperson.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still exploring whether it is more meaningful to own or sell real estate and then rent it again", he said.
Thus, the largest credit institute in Germany again gives up its company seat after a short time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from its own fund investors and subsequently renovated them costlyly.
Energy conversion swallowed around 200 million euros, according to data.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, experts estimate the value of the renamed towers to "Greenowers" at a cost of around 500 million euros.
The spokesperson said that it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the fund's assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memory of the buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
The dead still haven't been rescued because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near Greymouth City.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the disaster occurred, but it found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend due to safety.
After the second strong detonation, authorities and experts came out of the fact that miners had no chance of surviving.
We still haven't managed to free the dead.
Now they honored the memory of dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They've been quiet for two minutes.
29 tables were built to honor the monuments of the buried miners, on which helmets, lamps and miners' names were built.
Also pictures and personal items, such as clothes and surfboards found their place here.
On government buildings, flags were flying at half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would again come out of the "deep ground" to the surface, saying to the participants of the memorial event the prime minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial event in addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims.
During the explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescuers began by extinguishing the fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as toxic gases dissolve, the cooling of high temperatures inside the mine begins, told journalists police President Gary Knowles.
Damn it, warriors!
Does horror suit the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to overcome the old lines again with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience do you think the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn was thinking of when he was filming "Walhalla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills in great measure almost with the supernatural power of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young men looking for bloody action because our hero helps our enemies by cruel methods of killing and even rips their guts out of his belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eye, as it is actually called, won't say a word throughout the film, and the other characters will say at most one or two sentences or let themselves fall to the miserable dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and debauched in the dreadfully beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera footage.
It's good when the film has multiple target groups, it's just a shame if they're excluding each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically defends himself from bringing his works closer to either more humour to the mainstream or less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most fans of the art cinema seem to be discouraged by spraying brains and intestines everywhere.
The supporters of action films will be bored at the latest when One-Eye sets out for free-explanatory reasons with a group of violent Christian ship missionaries to Jerusalem and remains hanged in the wind and fog for all eternity before apparently reaching America and continuing to remain silent.
It is therefore no wonder that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not make it to the cinemas and was now released only on DVD.
It is a pity mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes to the broken blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or the exact story, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
And there's no escape for the viewer.
Refn will not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly smothers him with his chilly shots and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, especially by the indescribable hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Eyes retains something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all the most one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become in time for enemies and transient allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It portrays destruction, perhaps but also only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has new alerts to the secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and it won't even allow control.
Around midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli fighter aircraft F-15 I attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of Euphrat; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in the International Bureau of Nuclear Energy (IAEA) documents when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in the valley that turns away from the stream.
Based on the US-American CIA Foreign Secret Service's late-April 2008 announcement, the reactor, also known as the nearby village el-Kibar, would be well suited to the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The '50s technique doesn't suit anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where the reactor components could have been before the destruction, to be a reduced copy of North Korea's Yongbyon Nuclear Center model.
In addition, photographs were still presented showing the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been shortly before the launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, it is not known much more than then, even the riddles have increased in time.
Former US-president George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence intelligence agencies in Europe are even more careful and speak only of a 'alleged reactor', although they consider the presentation of the CIA 'good faith'.
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
When asked how sure he is that he has a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat responded in the summer, the IAEA said it had "sufficient material to ask questions".
The tux reportedly "unused military buildings" was quickly cleared and also properly leveled the terrain.
Still, in June 2008, the IAEA team under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar managed to find traces of uranium that was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photos of commercial vendors via the Member State from the time after the attack, which should be more appropriate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they are exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA can therefore not confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that she had never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, expressed by Damascus.
But that disproved the IAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss things - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, he banned the auditors from a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of a bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this", confirmed recently the official position at the time of the reigning Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
Thus, the investigation of this case has taken place without result since June 2008 and "is growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as the high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - this is a serious violation of the nuclear weapons ban treaty that the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter to be another three facilities to be "in functional link" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet stated, nor which devices are involved, nor what function they have, or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to it as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariyah, derived again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings that is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason Syria rejects the IAEA's approach to these three locations.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
IAEA has backgrounds and satellite images that between these three locations and the square at Euphrates transported material to and from Euphrates.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one equipped should be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is no "any evidence of sensible activities", i.e. uranium enrichment and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium should later be chipped into a bomb, there are only likely estimates for these central issues.
It is also unknown whether the debris that could hide important traces are stored in these three locations.
It's as if hundreds of cargo cars have disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seems to have any information as to where the debris has gone.
Only a few kilometres from el-Kibar away and on the other side of Euphrat lying a salt mine al-Tibni, which had Syria inspected as a suitable storage facility for radioactive waste in 1998, the IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley linked him to the reactor in one satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, scans from space show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out earthworks at all suspicious locations and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles are talking about the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for revisions that would allow Syria to preserve potential military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the revisions have.
Meanwhile, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna still calmed down a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why the thing is not on fire, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called Special Inspections for several months, which is one of the toughest means that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken of the "opportunity to which I lean in the future", but he is hesitant.
This option poses a great risk: on the one hand, it takes a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors to do so, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love in Wartime
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on the still-unnamed chief first-names in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, it's the love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
So far, much more is unknown - but it also causes unrest.
It has been said consistently that the woman who is Muslim falls in love with her during the war in Yugoslavia with the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary quickly moved.
In the meantime, the film has finished in Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote through the UN-organization to help UNHCR refugees Jolie and asked to meet an actress, now informed Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also the UN-organization ambassador to help refugees.
It is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
Love stories did not occur in camps where rape took place, and Jolie’s attitude toward victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN-organization to help refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, informing the Guardian.
What kind of scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read her script, authorized filming after minor tugs in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author emphasizes that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has made great efforts to address the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved space.
Due to the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film that sounds really different on the Internet: lovers knew each other before the war began and meet again when she is as a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds a lot different than "rape victim falls in love with his torturer".
The fact that the film Jolie really begins before the war is true.
Jolie argues that pressure is exerted on her, which is "not fair and based on misinformation".
Now she can be freed by the Hekers of Hollywood: By illegally posting on the Internet her script, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening, it's good for the Irish again.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar at the sound of loud music, stomping their feet.
Bailey-Pub in South Irish Cork boils because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and they hit.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and to do so tickets to Las Vegas at the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shouted beer game and a restrained computerist, it does not match very well.
Still, a 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, unresponsive from the burdensome question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, going on an interview to New Zealand in January.
"I've got a weird feeling about this," he says.
"It's so far and I haven't got a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "immediately she got her dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign", says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have attempted their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT-advisor in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners it looks in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish leave the country in the foreseeable future, forecasting experts from the ESRI Institute of Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be an emigrant wave similar to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of rising, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, displeasure is now spreading again.
The economic crisis makes the young, educated Irish people, who have only experienced a rise so far.
The loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was lost.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers complaining, "In Ireland everything goes downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"Please turn off the last one."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black, as the government is said to be merely deceiving and offers young people no future prospects.
"They reduce minimum wage, but have no strategy to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
Watching her classmates hang out from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers total service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, work abroad is an excellent chance to take first steps in the career rankings", says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Seán O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house at Gelsenkirchen right now.
In January it continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay off the house loan.
"Situation is sometimes really a little crazy", he says when for the first time in a long time he crosses the threshold of his own house.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in at all."
He laughs embarrassedly and walks through cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, large expensive cars parked in the driveways.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for €380,000 - 100-percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money was without many questions", he says.
Is he worried that the loan might not go well?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The engineer doesn't like the moaning he hears so often these days.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island", he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back again and life passed on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Keep the future open and simply wait for life to evolve elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one more thing that concerns him very much these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might go wrong for a bachelor party.
"No emotions at all", he says, and he drinks a good beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a retirement party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
Criminal activity raises more concern than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, held in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the area.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is on average 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where economics recovered after a profound decline in production last year.
But only about half of the polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are the Democrats' convictions, which pulls down the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the area expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in their country in practice, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it was a major increase (graf 3).
About 34% said they trusted the Assembly in their country and 45% trusted the government, again they are the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
The aid was created during the world financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and declined again to 32%.)
But moods change in a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
Only the second time more respondents across Latin America have seen crime as the most important problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to the data of 38% from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private business and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the area say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage has increased from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has risen from 47% of last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% there supports private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
Criticized Choices
No one expected the general election in Haiti to be perfect on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections meant filling urns and repetitive voting, ballots scattered over canals, broken polls and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many relocated due to the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several presumed predecessors, shouted that this was a fraud and called for the election's abolition.
Protests, some of them violent in nature, spread throughout the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, stated that "in many respects, these were quite good choices."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have carefully said that "they do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they were, did not necessarily have to cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are owed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestine, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive duel is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martella, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, a former First Lady, stepped away from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is designated by the Electoral Commission for having achieved a decisive duel.
Due to the rampant cholera epidemic and over 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there was concern that the voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but for the sake of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
Roughly 250,000 identity cards necessary for the vote remained undivided shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
It is clear, then, that the Haitians will take the lead on this.
On the tiptoe of downtown
In weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, has been benefiting from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity has boosted from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Still, turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in the next year's election may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández gives up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these marks everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first pair to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner for a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (at which there was slapping and accusing the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for the next year, with the President having more space to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: this year, growth is likely to be up to 9%.
Official inflation rates are now 1.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure that is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleared INDEC, a statistical agency that proceeded to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private businesses and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is making it known that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government formed an agreement with bondholders who had previously rejected debt restructuring, which Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, President Fernández faces an agreement with creditor governments, which are grouped together at the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that the IMF should not see this as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index that would commemorate an introduction to cleaning INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to gain middle-class support, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce the many views her husband held in politics.
Half - Encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on 27 November for mayors and city councils in five urban districts, which may be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail over the mainland and have a strong commitment to business relations, including the partially free trade agreement, in the greatest reconciliation of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the mayor's five offices, she failed to win by a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined to greater Taiwan independence, won almost 50% of all votes against the 45% KMT party.
If this were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has declined by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with KMT on city councils.
Elections took place like most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags with saves clad girls.
It even included a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
The man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien clean through the face, wounded him and killed the viewer.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Perhaps China was the only great campaign winner.
It was remarkable how the issue of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, candidates struggled over plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also dropped the rise of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma has confirmed for his party that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue with commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would certainly also like to see political integration, but first things first.
It will be better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP Party has discovered itself.
Two years ago she was on the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and advocate of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation has evolved that is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was summoned as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a 'trustful alternative' to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would do better if they insisted Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight to choose between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's evaluations were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go on the campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
KMT spokesman says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan for establishing friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy Award nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
The performance at the request of the President and people are bound to notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who President Obama chose to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is referred to as one of Grammy's surprises this year with a nomination in the category of Best New Artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with Grammy rules that the artist must not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Her 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward and, thanks to its carefree vocal style and agile hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success recorded by Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent to the Grammy voters looking for a similar jazz work in this category over the past years.
Elsewhere Grammy judges rightly appreciate the Vijay Iyer Trio album "History" in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing album ride that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a valiant New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" show was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin, and Jeff Lorber albums.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge of steampunk won several deserved acclaim in the category of large ensembles, when in competition stood chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical music category
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Grammy annual Grammy Awards.
Head of the nomination has Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with the number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with the number of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to South California appeared Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance at awards.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, namely Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was given to Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" project by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castroti" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saaria and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are nominated for Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
About 30 minutes of work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental performance by the soloist with the orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the Metropolis Ensemble based in New York City.
"I wrote it with the help of notes from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony while recording works by Stravinsky.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivaca Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, soprano Jessye Norman received the nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives approval from the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics attacked the project to promote terrorism and lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in compliance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, who you can think of," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who oppose only shout loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time discussions took place with people who were in favor or against the center. These votes were evenly divided, reports Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one comment appeared.
"We are Planet of the Apes with Statue of Liberty set in the sand".
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, the site of tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community, numbering approximately 135 families, lived in Riverside County for years without incident, but wished for a larger and more suitable space than the warehouse space he rented along with the filtering system manufacturer.
The new mosque, measuring 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture, will also have two minarets and will grow to 43 feet in height.
It should occupy a site of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, extends the space for searching for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has opportunities that stand outside the main elements that have been so far considered and fundamental.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that it is a form of truly 'outland' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of a report that appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
It has long been considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"You will begin to wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life outside the Earth, as researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life may look like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report of this news published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, triggered widespread speculation on the Internet that the report revealed the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That's not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to exploit other elements that fuel biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows replacing one element with another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, thus considering that microb, which is exposed to both elements, can be able to replace one after another.
"Arzen is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus".
"The result is that organisms can very hard to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that just like phosphorus does not work. When it enters the organism, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic that bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better at the effect of phosphorus, but as they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility is increased that the life form that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or on the moon, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but there was never an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it formed in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, reported to the Sheriff of the Los Angeles area on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and a large pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, informed the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs then on Wednesday late evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught to comment on the case.
They were very happy to find their two Akitas at the Downey shelter on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old male Trace and 10 month-old female Didi, were unharmed, informed by authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi breeds Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who had planned to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undetected until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were to compete in other competitions, scheduled on the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba show exhibition, said Peek daily The Times on Wednesday.
South California is only one stop on nearly a month's steam travel after dog shows.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside the window of the room.
They also took with them three dogs - a pup boxer, Parson Russell Terrier and a Bretan hare - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akites and Pembroke left Welsh corgis in a car where it should have been cooler.
They opened the windows a little so the dogs would have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dogs. Dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to roar again now that MGM’s restructuring receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvency Judge of New York officially blessed the "pre-packaged" plan of creditors to settle about $5 billion of debt and clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing films and television shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order, MGM remains no legal obstacles to relaunching the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become chief leaders of the slimming studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 of the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to finance new operations and MGM production.
It is now a connection with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009, when Moelis & Co.'s investment bank was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances, as management struggled to afford $300 million a year in interest payments.
On August, chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay US$2 billion plus the funds required by creditors.
In the spring of this year everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditor in late October.
When MGM officially rises from bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which are charging $4 million for their services that run the company's run, receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restore production in MGM, which released only one film that year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will come out early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films whose draft will be the book "Hobit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debts, sought to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your gift budget in balance
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by the video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that at the cost of one iPad you can buy five BMX rounds for $99 and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 bead jumps or approximately 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law worked; this year's technology toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to last years.
While relatively less new toys with associated websites appeared, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increased, as are the number of toys with charging batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All listed prices are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases marked differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, since 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you press their belly.
At one press, the animal releases a tone and the other press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, since 2 years old)
Last year I borrowed a 14 inch animatric doll at Elmo Live Technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with bicycle blocking.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember Alphia, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn driving into fun with a self-repaired, witty workbook.
If you're looking for a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children 3 to 8 years of age) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children 3 to 12 years of age), the first significant Leapster series change from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children 3 to 7 years of age) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a SD card slot that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, the Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from the age of 8) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than the matchbox, each of which has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing blocks in a row before time runs out; it is great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented to the highest extent in toy shops.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years of age), which contains a coin with hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits at the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a puffle animal.
A little bigger than your toothbrush brush bristle is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from the age of 5), the latest in a series of microrobots on button battery.
The beetle moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's funny when you make a maze out of cubes and see if he can find a way out.
It's also very durable.
Ours was able to fall with the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
The introduction of more subtle police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, strictly controlled his orders and issued orders in a semi-voiced manner with military authority.
He wanted women's members - China's strong enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their harsh procedures and passion for violence - to convey some impression of a small group of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, she whispers quietly, "What pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted according to the ruler.
Four headgear perfectly sit on hair that are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang, presumptuously.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered new wickets to have a higher education.
Guangdong Province changed grey-green uniforms to reportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China replaced stiff looks for strong armaments: in 2009, it was stated in a report that 50 officers encircled the snack cart and looked intently at the owner until the door salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 residents in Chengdu chose the operation as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also the softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would be having trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media commonly captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province beat an unattended viewer to death after using his cell phone to film as they do in the crackdown on the landfill protest.
Last year, police training in Beijing took place, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, there was a description of how to effectively beat up the perpetrators with no sign of blood.
This year, a door-to-door melon merchant in Shanghai got into a brawl with five police officers and suffered an injury to the left brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, depicts Chinese policemen attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan frightened the government," China Daily, a national edition, lamented last year after another discussion on tactics.
The paper said "really thoroughly cleansed."
Skeptics say that's not enough.
After the district advertised an interest in eight new female police officers in October, editorial The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real duties or are merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district demanded female contenders aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the correct proportion."
The adoptions should have a height higher than the diameter - i.e. more than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
The functionaries claim that work is mentally too demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed cop at Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine the others, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "inner quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said and added, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City Board, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that college requirements in China are also common for other jobs, both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means the question of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Healthy disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He can't allow a lame or hunchback to serve us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, which holds a patrol on Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years old, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She does not believe that the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her dimple associate, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the city's image."
They do not object to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely driving traders into alleys where they can perform their activities.
Every morning, the group stands against more than ten marketers who run on foot or on wheels and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu when the marketer started running, and for a while he left his bike with a noodle cart.
Policemen describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in her free marketing.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers as their male counterparts to entertain the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that is common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after false rumors were spread about police killing sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed scarcely.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where a police officer was patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry all he wanted.
15 minute distance in front of the cops, looking rabid, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with a motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator attached to the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and smoothing image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr Li said factually.
"Most of the time, it's the public who starts it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge involving his affair with a former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, reported to the Senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and was, until the time of the scandal, regarded as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair came into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said that he was a decision that followed almost a year's investigation, "surely pleased".
The Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate Ethics Commission.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice "informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the target of the investigation and that he was not planning to press further charges against him on this matter."
The Department of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times stated that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that was to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after they employed Mr Hampton to lobby for them, stating so much documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was ruled out by law from lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, has appeared in violation of the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that was published "it turned out to be a clear case of preparing a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are under investigation by the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for Senator Ensign's decision, Mr Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said that the Ministry was cautious in terms of political lawsuits, after a large number of setbacks, including the decision of last year to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of misconduct by the state prosecutor.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics organization in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a law group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign on the subject.
"It essentially shows that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief lawyer, announced in an interview that he received a call from the Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and subsequently the next day, and told him that the Ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a Wednesday statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had passed on to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable describing the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint in which an ethics group accuses that Ensign Hampton's parents' payment of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The Election Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbyist job was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began to operate in the company as a lobbyist, head of staff of Mr. Ensign - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "punched" into the Home Office on the subject discussed.
Mr Ensign also attended lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr Hampton for a lobbyist job.
When last year's report of the affair first appeared, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his post as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to attend the third Senate term.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of an investigation into a crime, his spokesman Jennifer Cooper stated that the senator hopes that the ethics commission will follow the Department of Justice quickly and end the investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she said further.
The challenge of the municipality of Cheshire turns to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the courtroom ranks.
One minute later, they sent news of a gruesome witness via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that over 140,000 Twitter reports dealt with raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, a trial of Steven J. Hayes was held, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and was to be held with the imposition of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed appeals with requests and arguments that the court would likely employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter's main reporters - created a "circuse atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then introduced a jury in a decision in the sense of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether, with the advent of new technologies, it would also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes' chief defense attorney.
The judge of the trial of Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected claims regarding last week's yield and that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence showing that the jury was acting under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases may raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court annulled the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the media trial was a "carneval atmosphere".
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration of the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the Courts of Appeals, which reviewed Hayes' judgment half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine the method of communication from the courtrooms, which was unimaginable for Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitraryly.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges may be concerned with the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is only one of Mr Hayes' many outlined lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
For example, the advocates also argue that Mr Hayes may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos of terror when choosing a jury.
Some of the jurors reported that they were horrified by photographs of the victims that became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The advocates argue that they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that by his decision he wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They stated in the objection against the verdict raised last month that the case dominated the Connecticut news and was debated during the election campaign by candidates for governor and United States Senate.
They argued that the media were constantly stirring up the flames of emotion in this case.
"Daily rush of media, cameras, and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something here in New Haven that has not yet been seen and it may also be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports mentioned later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should manage the field of action of other trials.
But some lawyers demanded Courts of Appeals with often used arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision in Dr. Sheppard's judgment, due to the spread of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "presents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was notable for its insults and negativity, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of true cooperation between two political parties or just an illusion moment before returning quickly to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's negotiations with President Obama and parliamentary leaders have not brought any major discoveries on the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, this was a polite discussion on the differences of opinion between two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
The Wednesday public meeting of the President's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close cooperation has built for several months mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological gap that still divides members.
And it's quite difficult to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - they probe each other's signs of collegiateness and compromise, attempting to evaluate the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's negotiations and its later evaluation of participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to propose a rapid change in the ratios that have been there for the last two years.
Whether it's a matter of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"These are inevitable after the election.
The election sparked the emotions of the straniks, and then they quieted down.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expired at the end of the year, and no one finds that favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot look at how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed reject unemployment support.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is seen about possible agreement on these issues, along with ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution notes that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties when the 112th Congress is convened for January.
Rather, there is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, said.
"After things have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," she said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - to the fact that courtesy will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box when the main events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the compilation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, know that they must act according to their promises and reduce government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These advocacy lines are clear in initial responses to recommendations on the deficit, which include reform of the Tax Code and increasing some taxes, increasing pension age and reducing spending.
Joint chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their opinion, exerted pressure on the issue of deficit to public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member commission to present their plan as official recommendations and therefore to fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officials in the jury, who propose that we have, at least today, small foundations or will for compromise in the case of financial issues.
Galston predicts two stages in battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will start next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans call on Obama to address the budget, taxes, and health care, when a period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What's the cause of the shift?
Public opinion.
There is much evidence that despite partyism in the last election, most Americans continue to want to see the two parties working together.
If it could be directed towards the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will very closely monitor public responses.
Anyone who threatens to lower the vote is likely to change course and seek compromise.
That can be an optimistic view of things.
Stranicity and rectification are now greater than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a greater ideological gap between Obama and parliamentary Republicans was created than was the case with Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week, many Americans would welcome it.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations on issues that still divide them.
The revealed American documentary depicts Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of the "kleptocracie", and it continues with part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come the way to Kremlin, the U.S. embassy in Russia reported in the records of February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal deals but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the 'vertical of office' - takes its own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was released on Wednesday through WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large share in corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in cleansing.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturin, who owns a prominent design firm, have been constantly denying corruption charges for many years, and winning several lawsuits for perjury charges for such allegations.
In September, at the Russian television station, when asked for a proven testimony about corruption, he said, "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will prove to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details expressed in such a way, namely in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of that it would be done by diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of Moscow and its association with criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government operates more as kleptocracies than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of criminal and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided by police, Federal Security Service, Federal Security Service (FSB), Ministry of Interior and Office of State Attorney, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analytics identified and three-stage structure in criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of Interior and militia are in second degree".
"And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors".
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in blanks in certain areas, as the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the largest firms and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (preferably than from organised criminal groups), as they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason protection from criminal gangs is no longer so on course".
The record says that while the collection of money is complex, protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough, their shops close under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke of fighting corruption several times, but he admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably loaded with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's Indian research team, in a recent interview.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no longer part of the political class because there are no longer political classes in Russia".
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that national corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
Countries rank at 154th place in a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption by non-governmental organizations Transparency International (the countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
Uncovering the news of the U.S. embassy, which appeared in Moscow not until late in the evening, certainly did not excite the Russian government, although only to the point that it could be blamed for Moscow's shortcomings, it may be a possibility for Kremlin to argue on the solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin reported that the documents released by WikiLeaks could have been counterfeit and responded angryly to a statement that American diplomats call him Batman and Medved Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is about our mutual synergy, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such coercion, you understand, so unethically."
The Khmer Red Veterans are forced to cope with the past
In a savings-lit concrete classroom with stained and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality during the reign of the Red Khmers, the commander remains in this remote possession of the Red Khmers in northwestern Cambodia popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Reds gave up their reign, there is a hacked long-lasting loyalty also in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime at the Forum of Truth and Reconciliation.
In June, the government provided textbooks that first explained the history of the Khmer Reds and their former soldiers.
And in July, bring together the UN and the Cambodian court the first conviction of a former member of the Red Khmers, bringing the verdict of a former leader, notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, there was increasing unrest among the veterans of the Red Khmers in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to reconcile and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Reds, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Reds was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the reign of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or died of hunger, disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowd the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and his troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sara managed guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first Democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured in 1999 by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most former Red Khmer fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgicly recall the time of the movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers retained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unqualified farmers.
"These people only benefited from surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which is run by public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology of the regime".
"They were raised without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Reds was good," he said.
"That Mok made a living."
"But now life is hard, because we have to secure everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Red Court also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Reds.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leaders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in these four cases as well.
It was little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation concentrated on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the reign of the Red Khmer in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced workers.
A recent steamy evening with Im Chae returned from working in the field to his wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared through the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Reds.
If the court had summoned her, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If more criminal prosecutions appear, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Reds in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought out other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodja must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer relations means sticking broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand ourselves."
The center published the first textbook approved by the government about the Khmer Reds, has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to a textbook on the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains fewer than four parties about the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vengo also knew little details about the Khmer Reds, despite the connection of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will prosecute the trial."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complicated and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, textbooks, and the court are beginning to influence, he has continued.
The Khmer Reds still have a powerful spell here.
Up in the mountains of the Danegrek Mountains, the road is covered with weeds and poured out by discarded plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle made of black soot, covered with a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bundle of mature bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to have its uranium-based weapons reserves
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would give up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement, issued after the Security Summit of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have hit a rock of trauma last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months a few classified operations have been done with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit".
"This proves the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, nuclear security support groups.
Clinton called the deal a "very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries dispose of all their supplies of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Summit on Nuclear Safety, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have high enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our commodity...We're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago and showed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was lightly irradiated, officials announced.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian facility for storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was performed by air, said officials.
The US government spent $13 million on the program, most of which on delivering less enriched uranium to the Belarusian Research Institute, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons production.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on a trust basis", leading to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Study estimated this year that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium applicable to the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint statement, seek to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have acknowledged that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish government did not go too far with CIA flights
The Spanish government has not been coy about CIA flights carrying imprisoned Talibans and Al-Qaeda members to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, as expressed in its telegram by the United States envoy in Madrid.
This follows from the documents provided by Wikileaks daily El País, where it also states that the then first Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus show that she has proper supervision of foreign aircraft passing through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, a meeting between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega was held in which a dozen states, including Spain, were charged with complicity in human rights violations.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's message "takes Zapatero's government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"Simply they just want to be informed", so that they are "not caught unprepared", tells Aguirre in one of the documents.
The then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible outlines, but by the fact that this matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as he is concerned, he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to request the declassified documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence regarding CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated file or any sensitive information", explained the Embassy after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern over the "obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassified CNI or Ministry of Defence information.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments", Regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the US ambassador and Home Secretary Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby's lunch, he told this ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had already given instructions to his colleagues, "let them avoid heated comments with the intention of reducing tensions".
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - c.) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that Zapatero's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government", notes.
Confessed mother-murderer complained on the network on the mother's "care"
A young woman spoke of a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror after Galicia"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname, which she had used since she was a child, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both of them are from the municipality of Noia in the area of La Corunja, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which ABC's diary reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tested.
Not long before she found a new boyfriend.
Her chosen man was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the baby stayed with her partner, who even came to Palma to visit her for a week.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has fallen apart.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes, "Alberto is some angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he has to be with the baby all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about a text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you a baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he claims.
in May he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only staying until 19, because I have to go to work so I don't lose my job".
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son to his place.
"He'll be with whoever he's supposed to be with, that is, me, and it'll never happen again in my life that I left him with someone other than my mother", a questionable intent given her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When he taps this report, it is believed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of that month, and probably was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"César is satisfied on one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes it here, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day".
They're talking about moving to Majorca.
"She's going to go to summer school there, so I'm going to save a little money for a nanny."
The 17th Greetings and Complaints.
"Big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how much he wants, meets me, sex is needed".
On the 30th, another report: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also a report about Victor, the current partner, "He gives me money."
On the Internet are Móniča's posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she kept calling herself "Muki ex-prisoner".
"Terror after Galicia (motto)".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, stated that the defendant does not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one in any way".
Before, however, she admitted to drowning Caesar in a bathtub and putting his body in a trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would have won 4 seats in the House and the PSC would have lost 9 mandates
with the results of November 28, the PP party could have the lead at the town hall in Lérida, Tarragona, and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (the People's Party of Catalonia - the Cl.) already has a given idea of the general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one such from the elections of Catalonia.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610.473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 Autonomous elections this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384.091 votes.
If this tendency of increase, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general election were to take place, the PPC could gain 12 MPs in the House compared to the current 8, the CiU side (Convergencia also Unió, Czech Match and Union - note of the translation) would also gain 4 mandates (now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and PSOE parties (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the People's Party, the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - note c.) would lose one Member - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia - note c.) would continue to have one mandate, or it would gain one more.
However, according to the election calendar, the closest meeting will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive impact on the end of socialist domination in the four major provincial cities as well as changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and populists agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town hall in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not receive a majority and would not even be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona Council - as at least 5% of the vote is needed.
The PP Party has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists believe they could play a major role in a turnaround in Tarragon, where they ruled together with the PP Party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida, the PP received only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The People's Party also acquired at other major town hall such as Badalona, Castelldeels, and Reus.
currently, PP has representation at 34 city hall in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to the Al Qaeda organization
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian who were detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadi cell run from Thailand, arranging passports for various groups of Al-Qaeda organization, among which were also "Tiger liberation of Tamil Ílam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", with the second group being the author of the bombings in Mumbai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure, through the "operation of Kampai", the weakening of Al Qaeda's counterfeit apparatus at international level and "limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that within two years of being active in Catalonia, this cell could send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then counterfeited and then shipped to groups that form the Al-Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their "fighters" could travel unpunishably across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations besides Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be no similar interventions in other European countries in the following days, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed another in Thailand in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were captured.
It was these men who were driving from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between 25 and 45 years of age, had to be valid for several years and were free of marked visas.
It is pointed out in the investigative documents that no facts have yet been known to link detainees from Catalonia to the assassination in Mumbai, despite the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency, which were "inserted" to purchase cards to mobile phones that were later used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have already confiscated many evidence.
The People's Party (PP) is asking Maso to stop the fiscal agreement
PPC Party Chairman (Catalan People's Party) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity to present her terms to Artur Mas personally, under which she is willing to support his commission as President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The Chair of the Catalan People's Party came to meet Arthur Mas with the certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in last Sunday's elections, which is more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment.
A possible consensus with the PP depends on the future alliance that nationalists in the House would like to hold when general elections are held, but so far, the talks that Mas is conducting these days with the rest of political leaders are carried out in Catalan spirit.
With regard to PP President to gain her support for putting her in office, "she will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches", as well as the economic agreement - similar to that of the Basque Country - which the CiU leader even wanted to vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the rampant political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations on Masov's commissioning will be discussed within PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today meets Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarita Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that deaths have not occurred due to a "lack of action"
The presentation of the centre of Olot does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to recount the damage caused to the institution of the criminal behavior of Joan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who, while employed here, killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala came in with the institution's lawyer, Joan Canada's attorney, and announced that "happening the home of La Caritat would be able to press charges against the guilty man" responsible for the killing, but "legality and responsibility bind us to leave this trial to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, La Caritat now poses a major threat to the home of La Caritat's material compensation requirements, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the bereaved.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had already taken place in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of senior clients, suspecting that in many cases no physician personally examined the deceased, but that - given the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat resolutely rejected this extreme through her director yesterday, stressing that "the lack of action could in no way have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's attorney added that "there are no indications in the case that any third party would be guilty of misconduct in addition to their own accused".
The man nicknamed now "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 killings yesterday and specified that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later killed the second old woman.
in this case, death caused too high a dose of insulin, as opposed to the first time he used a mixture of soothing tablets.
Director La Caritat said it was complicated to control personnel' access to medicines.
Insulin and a sedative cocktail were probably six of the nine means used by this caregiver to kill patients in their efforts to relieve them of suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is lying and was actually looking for a less cruel death for her first victims or killed them by lye administration, as he had already admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of killed may be higher than the one he confessed to, and justify their behavior in the various versions given by Vila to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
They therefore say that they want to be available to the judiciary to illuminate the full scope of the matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Yesterday, investors responded sharply to yesterday's threat to President Trichet of the European Central Bank, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral differentials were closed by force, and European banks' shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although there is a decline, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It'll take the investor some time to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank cited us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan to buy out the State debt for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within a period of time and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to predict "minimumly by March" and to maintain a three-month licitation with unlimited access by the end of this trimester in order to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and that they will even announce its intensification.
If they fail to meet created expectations, they will re-create the market response from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to continue downloading the liquidity rate, God will be with us!
The same was true at the convention in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, it was announced by the armoured fist on Monday, and on Wednesday it announced that it had already purchased many, causing another market collapse.
Yesterday's licitation of notes for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the auction previous.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell 30 points below, reflecting the change in mood in the market that occurred after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, figures were published representing the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent roughly 10,000 million in short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after failing to reveal the problem with stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the ancillary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need Parliament's approval and still lacks sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to prevail in Ireland.
Angela Merkel eased the tone of her speech to ease the tension in her face for the next EU summit held on December 14, on which a political compromise is needed to show that we are the Union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan for action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, employment recovery measures - to investors' ears, this sounds like four seasons from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased by 4.5%, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the effect of surprise.
Today, we have a key bond licensing for three years, which will be favoured by the effect of Trichet, which we hope will be a great demand for which will help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash that we do not need - 40,000 million in cash is available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would be closed to sine die.
However, Cesar's wife's strategy must continue to be used - "not only to be it, but also to seem it."
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen group will attack Vega Sicilia's meetings requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not cease.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, attacks him after he considered him "quite insignificant", a legal act by El Enebro scheduled for the 16th of that month and requested five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize themselves with the help of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José fine-tune the legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of corporate services does not seem willing to give up his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven descendants were removed from its administration committee, named forerunners during the shareholders' assembly on January 18, this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register.
The trial of the El Enebro Group scheduled for the sixteenth of that month, convened by the official of the Commercial Court number 2 in Madrid, resumed the roar in the womb of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means to guarantee the convocation of the commission until the dispute is resolved.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty, and Elvira Álvarez's Mezquiriz considers David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial deceit and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of January 18, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this act as "quite insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who discreetly remain silent, tried without success to call a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned alongside other activities by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez's 100% capital.
According to family protocols, however, the group's founder demands a 51% capital use right.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide in the hearing on the question of judicial assault of the hearing.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapon from Siemens
Software proposes real-time improvements in vehicles.
Since Red Bull invaded the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this new arrival team, and despite the recent upward trend, they all bet on Ferrari's triumph by Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 a legend was born - a "secret weapon" that the multi-national Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for the purpose of a very remote automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for high precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens's industrial division, explains that the use of this software device allowed Red Bull team to implement "within a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements during a single period.
The Red Bull team is working today on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
Siemens's manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical convenience is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull set up a top technology plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that's going on here is considered a "big secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champions Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is in Formula 1, no doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, hide behind the vast technological means that the brand of energy drinks has put into its participation in racing circuits, while no one knows them.
Chief of Production Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest were due to riders.
at present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 of its own stores in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with her business partner Pont Reyes festively opened her first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 80 to 100 m2 stores to be opened in Spain in the following two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of Spanish HP Helena Herrerová listed as an example of the newly rebuilt store in Barcelona Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 sales venues in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, however she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores would still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
North American company advises here with exclusive design of shop equipment (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also concerned with securing business personnel.
Helena Herrerová denied that this was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in purchase, service, after-sales service and even packaging".
Business in Barcelona is part of a world-class pilot pioneering program aimed at solving possible problems with computer devices in warranty.
Online service is connected to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"We will be able to solve problems within 10 minutes, which otherwise can take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and ordinary customers, given that large firms already have a contractual service of technical assistance", Helena Herrerová stressed yesterday.
Sabadell's betting on "stealing" over three years to his competitors a million clients
More optimistic than other bosses, a delegation member of the Banco Sabadell Bank Board, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of passive war.
Nevertheless, it expects a reduction in interest rates, which they will try to compensate for by reducing bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to manage to acquire a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - or 700,000, if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - because until now, even the Institute has been pampering small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% in terms of private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or one can also say sobriety, in order to reduce the costs the bank will show when it presents results for the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare to set targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for world banking.
Sabadell closes his Optima program this year, set four years ago, although originally it was for three years, but the market situation required enlargement for the next period.
Clients who leave savings banks will be their main target group.
At the meeting held by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "hard and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the journey from the crisis in Spain "will be lengthy".
In addition, in two or three years' time it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe that passive war - which reduces margins - is giving up, the price of the mark-up for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus compensating for the reduction in margins.
"The liquidity and funding theme is structural and will represent a pressure factor on loans".
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high", acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued orders on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking "now is a reduction of commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell Bank’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but, as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required".
"The next year will not remain on the stone", he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "much reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institution will enter between red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can be a substitute for fund collection on the market before a new capital measure.
After the assurance that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, the serious problem continues to be what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave by merging savings banks
CECA's CEO rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of mergers of savings banks, and again insisted on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of bringing together Spanish savings banks began, several institutions were convinced that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Bank (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled out yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most mergers have already been made, Cajasol's incorporation into the Banca Cívica Group cannot be considered a second round, what occurs are conventions".
"Most are completely implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated very well on this matter", the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting, Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process was being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with how it is being shown in the instalments that, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank", he stressed.
"Go from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make these larger and thus in accordance with the Basel Treaty", underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a number of not very happy views on the slowness of the process" that show "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is a reminder that we must be in time before the end of the year".
Yesterday, CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured that Spain has the most stringent financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director noted that, in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings and a system that managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well of the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
The tension in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, to regulation of private intermediation agencies, or abolishing EUR 426 for unemployed people without benefits, to privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management - cl.), airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgad, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, has, on the other hand, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel due to her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How do I interpret these motions?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex redefinition process of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is supposed to be, which refers to the idea of adherence to old traditions, which is followed by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European opposition, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would include Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although it may now appear to be a scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to Germany's proposals, a revision of the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigour, fines for the guilty states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and an extension of the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for spins now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission stimulated deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered correct (the plans of fiscal rigour and the stability of public finances), and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country when Merkel painfully stretched out her decisions to save Greece.
It was already the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also published were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again appeared with a clear opinion when she demanded to reform the European Union's conventions in order to allow the rescue of a Member State and, at the same time, so that private creditors would have a duty to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat moderate form, has been approved, and over the next months we should follow the Union reform process, which should allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has set a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures are now needed, which it seems to disagree too much with, from this date on, the old operation of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which countries breaking the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare deferment of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a strict path of growth with an increase in savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
They simply do not want to tolerate another option based on receivables and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that ruled Spain’s growth boom in the years.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is a lot tougher.
And worst of all, under these conditions, we could be wrong about ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will relieve more calm.
And that we'll take advantage of the opportunity they're giving us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this, and his double statement (reforms promised after meeting large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite critics on Merkel's address, the way has opened up the idea that things need to be fixed.
However, there is a red line that Germany has set, and it does not seem to want to move it.
And the options that can be considered cannot be excluded from leaving the eurozone full of under-reputable countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The tricks performed by Alonso and Ramos in a match with Ajax show ingenuity, not intent to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is non-sportsmanship, and whether or not the UEFA should punish both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (who had their team clearly won) named players one by one deliberately wasted time at the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the judge, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfill the prescribed penalty in the following match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in their group at the forefront - and will be able, stripped of cards, to continue to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Commission awarded coach José Mourinh a two-game penalty and the guilty players received a cash penalty.
The provocation of the yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, that is, rules that, although unwritten, follow each other.
Part of the discussion in this case came about because its participant was the Real Madrid team (who boasts generosity and honor in his anthem, and who has already fined his players for similar acts), and as it seems, also thanks to the drama led by Mourinh, who thus adds another episode to his long history of comedian and provocative.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of action, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether there is circumvention of the law in these acts; indeed, it is actions that respect sports rules whose meaning seems to be trying to circumvent.
The type of damage such acts cause to the sports spirit is being resolved.
One of the features of sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opponents, which was not violated in these cases, so there was no violent play.
Another of these features characterizing a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage against the opponent's team because of their misdemeanors - which also did not happen here.
So the paradoxical thing about Real Madrid players' action is the fact that what we normally characterize as a ruse or circumvention of the law has not been a secret violation of the rules in order to avoid penalties, but this behavior should have been as evident as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and liked to be punished.
Another question, however, is what advantage guilty of their deliberate transgressions will have.
It must be noted here that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that in the current match he will not achieve any benefit, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for the next match, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
Clearly, the advantage is that players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardise their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by doing so, players will be punished, and they will go to the second round of cards in which one card less than in the first round is sufficient to exclude.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sports spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that allow maximum benefit to be gained under the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, players were not intended to avoid granting punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather to choose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or running from punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention is not clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a wit.
It seems to me that polemics arise for two reasons: because they were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the transfer of instructions was carried out to provoke them from the leadership.
Damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictator concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid by employees themselves who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December again come pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the asked entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complication of numbers, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) on the application for a week from 13 December, creating an avalanche of reservations for peak days (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was hardly any traffic.
As has been happening since 2008, when the thin years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To avoid abandoning traditions, many employees pay their own expense at parties.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of tenacity, claims the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona Association, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of the restoration facilities at the moment dares not predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will change their minds before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to price topic, they are careful", he adds.
Stores will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", says and recalls that the crisis makes customers tend to go down a step and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest strain of booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real reservation boom for this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, which they have adjusted the offered menus, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another important company, which is Andilana, numbering 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar to more early reservations from the beginning of November.
"We have done both possible and impossible to keep last year's prices, and our menus, of which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros", they say.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and a total of 23 businesses, they remain optimistic after they have seen an increase in profits since the second half and have a fairly solid prospect of Christmas sales.
The sources of this company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day, as pre-Christmas celebrations among friends will take place.
to their six group menus they added the menu Christmas, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded the tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine) compared to last year.
They have also noted that there are already companies that invite their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
The vice president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "revived", although clients "contract to the maximum".
This impression did not budge even during Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan’s nuclear program spawned a great unrest in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a "faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the ties between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State published by Wikileaks portal confirms the extraordinary unrest that in Washington is causing Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to clarifying and notable details that they offer regarding the content of communication and ideas of North American diplomacy representatives in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, as regards nuclear security, rather than increasing, is "in decline", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored after works to make their destruction in the event of an attack difficult - represents one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in a report before visiting the then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, alleged nuclear diversion and vulnerability to the transport of atomic materials".
An increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and controlled missile programs are no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as spreading and representing a reason to be wary.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in education and culture levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or missile-controlled programs", said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with their US counterparts.
Julian Assange's biggest news is the increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation topics and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
The dispatches issued by the embassy in May, which qualify communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", claim "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unresponsive or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "Despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "very well clarified" during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's military chief, that the "Pakistan Army must put an end to silent support for terrorist groups".
Hunting for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking worker responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to trace and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange forms a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced yesterday a "exceptional challenge", called red notice, to "localize and monitor movement" by Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens assures attorneys that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assang".
It was November 20 when the congregation of international police based in Lyon, France issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday when it received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "in order to impose temporary custody on him and release him".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person concerned with the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notice to allow the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national component of the police - especially if the states have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be located.
This move offended Assenge's lawyers, who published writing yesterday, claiming that the thirty-nine-year-old founder of Wikileaks showed willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities using videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovich Berija, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit", reports the letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but she is not silent.
On Monday, through Skype, from an unknown location, he interviewed Time magazine's editor-in-chief - in this interview demanded the resignation of United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to espionage in the UN and thus violate international conventions signed by the United States, she should withdraw", he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the individual's opinion that runs the website", he declared for CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a high-ranking worker responsible for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding Assange to the importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairing the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber as of January, asked the Foreign Ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations "in order to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance to them".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who stated that Assange should "be killed", which he subsequently had to call off.
"Obama should put a reward on him or use drone or something".
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for president.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for leaking information, commits treason and any other punishment than execution would be too mild", declared at Fox Station
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "sighting" at the adherent of Carodo
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on their stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe to fight the already multiple internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - note Cl.), with no result due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party's chairman is aware that his gesture about the resignation seems inadequate to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot cause him as much concern as he had with other defunct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win new critics through winking, which will help him to rally into municipal elections.
At first, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to secretly speak out for his remaining in office.
By using ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the adherents of Carod want to turn over a criminal vote to the Prime Minister, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid dissension and subjugation of his person.
in several interviews he argued that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the vote and one extra, but added without specifying the percentage that he would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Carado's followers demand more from the chairman than to put his office at his disposal - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest organ at the conventions.
But given that they do not have enough majority to enforce demission, they will try executively to commemorate the plan from now until May.
As a result, they expect to participate in the development of a document on strategic reorientation, on which leadership will vote on the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move Congress as early as autumn 2011.
The leader of the ERC stated that "many votes" damage stability, and that its goal is to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
in this context, there seems to be a distinctive article that current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós' ideologue, this innovation advisor took for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he appointed them five of them, two of whom stand out.
The first is "recomponsive" executives to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means including new faces that are from the sector inclined to Carod.
The second target can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC completely end the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he fights for the reform of the statutes in order to be able to hold congresses through delegates selected by ballots.
The end to the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcercós' team, which fought in this direction already at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 cramped assembly decided that the meeting had to be assessed at the Special Congress on Statute Reforms.
This matter is still unresolved, as the situation inside the party discouraged the solution to this matter.
Now, without lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to pursue this matter again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 murdered in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decline of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, as reported by the MILENIO daily.

In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no life signs was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla with two blows to the back of her head.
A tattoo of the sacred figure Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death") was discovered on the skin of a woman, as well as necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a corpse of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, two men were found with their heads wrapped in tape and they also found a report, in the municipality of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations saying, "This will happen to those who will not adapt".
in Ecatepec, two bodies were found bearing signs of torture and had her limbs bound, inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony of Justice.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl districts.

Along with him, agents and a message note were found.
China follows its target to reduce greenhouse gases
A representative of this country at the UN Climate Change Conference COP16 assured that his country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce the carbon footprint, specifying that he insisted on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But he has made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this with the international community.
He reported that China's strategy on climate change is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, they have already seen progress, including last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
He also stressed that in China, the federal authorities cooperated in a coordinated manner with provincial and local authorities to achieve their targets in terms of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he has said, various multi-year plans, which are funded by both the Chinese Government and other states, have been in operation or have already been completed.
For example, as he said, the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been introduced over the past five years, and which has received investments from the UN, governments and private initiatives.
Also running a provincial project of climate change, also a project of exchange of fluorescent lamps for energy-saving bulbs and a project of mitigation and adaptation, specified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert advisor for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than they were generally thought.
For example, he recounted greenhouse gas emissions per capita representing 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects it to make further progress by 2020.
Enacted Exclusion Espina: Caesar Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - c.) stated that the former Chairman of this Party is entitled to demand from the National Order Commission of its law.
The National Chairman of the PAN Party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was enacted, and that the former Chairman of this Party is entitled to refer to the National Order Commission and claim its right.
In an interview taken before the objection was raised by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina was in any event a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora".
"Mr. Espino has the right to turn in his case through a complaint to the National Council's Order Commission to make a decision made by the competent authority", he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that she had never been at the negotiating table about the alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that PAN would come out of the internal elections held the following 4 and 5 December, in which his follower would be elected, strengthened.
"This (Aliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was a plan for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose", he noted.
The chairman of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue stood behind his party, and therefore "we do not fear internal competition, on the contrary we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said that the committee could without question elect the best chairman or chairman that the PAN deserves for the next three years, so it will hand over the relay to the "whom the committee will appoint".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of the five proudly hand over the party chairman's office".
He predicted that the rise that the party had recorded in the last elections of July would be reflected in future races, although "there is no time to think about 2012 yet".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task".
in this context, he stressed that these three governments, with roots in the alliances in Oaxaka, Pueble and Sinaloe will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and desires are inserted into them, and I am sure that Gabina will live up to these expectations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón aside PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, note)) due to his speeches within the four years he reigns, César Nava called on PRI members to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believe that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the reigns of Fox and Claderón, then let them start defending them, let them come out of their shell", he testified.
He stated that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during the speech at the National Auditorium, as there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes on Twitter a law to support students without papers
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", tweeted the US president on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama today contributed to his personal Twitter social network account to national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", tweeted Obama.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet reference to a more extensive document that asks the public to contact the Senators immediately, as the vote on this bill is coming up.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to hear your opinion", he points out.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding would be approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of the new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be compiled.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must settle the matter of taxes before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement on this matter and then we can plan the order of other matters", he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request "vote to close the discussion" regarding the Dream Act, so that a motion to legalize students without papers could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although he is more likely to be next week.
The senatorial approval of the Dream Act, or "American Dream" law, would legalize roughly 800,000 young people who reached the United States before finishing 16 years, resided in the country during the last five years, and were admitted to an institution of higher education or army.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, so they need the help of several Republicans, so that the organizations of his supporters carry out intense agitation to ensure that this law is passed.
Democrats, whose majority of Dream Act supports, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this bill.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act project need to acquire several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters negotiate the most are Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing Senator from Florida George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have stated that they will not support him next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the House of Representatives leans towards another version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature inserting a finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put a finger in the wound" is similar to Czech "hit a nail on the head - note klaga.)
Second round of the cycle Pleasure from the language was a promenade where participants performed literary gala performances
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... A finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure from the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another round table they devoted themselves to the topic Sex in the language, explained).
The finger to the wound "brings us to the narrow", said a lovely Argentine writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people who met at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear this debate at the round table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Maya Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she dedicated to Gonzal Celorius, which Schultz then described as a great story in which Luisa performed in the first person as a protagonist, who goes from doctor to doctor in seeking knowledge of what the "morning" is, from whom she does not get answers although the traces of the same story do.
The infectologist walks away convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my blow".
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it really opened and the symbolic scar is".
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she was only able to learn so much about the wound that she was really open and that she did not exist", but became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand together.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also performed with a delightful narrative, which he called Praise an invention in which the finger is not named in the wound, but in one moment appears.
with the elements of magical realism she tells of the famous witch who played clouds, bringing back the people who went far, or correcting the virtue lost by one virgin, this narrative, which then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers, who told it, are cited here by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes exaggeration in the narrative of conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (writers), mocked the fictional testimony that was presented in stories as real, but in other ways never managed to tell the story of America with such imagination that lacked even shame".
However, he emphasized, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and precisely where reality and lie are blended, where it is no longer known which of the story belongs to one group and what to the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
That's what he calls a "cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its talk Finger into the wound allowed.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer pointed her finger at the major blow of social violence going through her country - and shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise that is obviously not intended", she said after stating that the reality of literature is a communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical response".
The evening was concluded by Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and consciousness control, which overflows with dogmasms, it is forgotten that "there is a small no behind every admission, and there is also a small yes behind every denial".
"To be masters of our ideas and realities we must color: and to color means to put a finger in a wound many times and to harass those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without discoloration, and to harass the authorities who prefer this black and white world", he said to support the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the finals, having experienced both good and bad during his career, but has already managed to achieve on three occasions for the decisive series.
In a duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different styles will also clash with their techniques, teams that have a distinct difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the finals, has experienced both good and bad over the course of his career, but has managed to achieve already on three occasions for the decisive series, but until now he has left with undone, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for the silver medal, remained a step behind the winners and Curiously played with the same team the following final.
The Santist strategist made it to his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament when he had in his hands the reins of the Morelia club, with which he succumbed overall 4–2 against Toluka; then again in the 2003 Clausura tournament he advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it to the overall score of 3–1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario tournament, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Seniors" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - note of the translation.) after 210 minutes of the game indecisively 2–2, after a series of penalty shootings he got to the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities to seal the title, but eventually his three players missed out of 11 steps and the team suffered a turn to 4–3.
Rubén had already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and could thus celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that he is the most important institution to him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I owe, and the title would of course also be for me, but the first one is most important", said the coach when asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
in a vivid memory he has a previous final in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned a lesson that until the referee sings the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we learned in this, until the match is over, we can't celebrate".
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: "You never try to get a series of penalty kicks, you try to quit in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be prepared for it, we were prepared in the last tournament, unfortunately but fate has prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, something left in us and hopefully this time will not happen".
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the latter and to taste the glory of titles for the first time.
The United States amends the rules for issuing visas
People will have to contact the Service Centres before interviewing the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa negotiation process will change at the United States Embassy and consulates.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Services Centre for Visa Applicants (abbreviated from ASC English) before interviewing the Consular Department.
The ASC personnel will collect biometric information from the applicant and will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer need to pay the fee for arranging the meeting, the second for processing the application and more for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only a single fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with applications (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular official, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
As biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra $26 service fee.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aviation and Space Bureau (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, science that deals with the study of origin, evolution, dissemination and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that she would introduce "an discovery that would cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life", arousing speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that, besides us, there are other creatures living in inhospitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility of one day becoming intelligent creatures such as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemiste National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere as it is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second life form, different from the one we know".
The Space Agency will announce the actual discovery range for tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explores Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron breed opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism", they claim.
The 60th parliamentary period was not even started when the opposition block was formed in Congress, led by members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revolución Democratica, Czech "Page of Democratic Revolution", PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Work Party", Convergencia (Czech "Shoda" note of the Republish) and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalv, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the House.
Prior to the opening of the 60th parliamentary term of Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo "sined" against the reform of the Constitutional Act as it eliminates them.
With this reform, they repeated, starting "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of sides who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santosova Aquilarova, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - c.c.) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form political marginality from the impulse of PRI parties (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He specified that in the following days they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if these do not have it, they would again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When she got here (opposition coalition), I'm looking at it because we're excluded from any decision, they're not even willing to consider the opinion of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from the Convergencia party stated that they agree with PRD, PT and Patron, and will therefore form a pluralist group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued to make Congress "duopolistic" after being monopolyd.
The aspiration of law reform is not to have infinite bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues to gain more votes, as added by Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, by PT, explained that Congress has currently become "the spoils" of the two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It was previously controlled by only one side, today divided by two."
Patron Montalvo requested that the Member's personality be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order for the five of us, who are likely to be nine, to see us at five right now, not to stay out of the way because of archaic agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have formed and agreed to, we stand out, and we disagree with this reform".
Another 200,000 pesos are being issued for "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlan will pay another check discussed to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial.
Another check for a little over 200,000 pesos was sent to the town hall by Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
The sum paid in this second semester to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial will climb to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency website of the town hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, was exhibited at a sum of 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject was stated "alignment of outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this contractor, who was being monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for high-price sales, another sum.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers", he said in one interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Bill, as the law states in the case of companies vetted by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasurer assures that she has not reused the services of the City Hall supplier.
In the previous period, after 25 July, Noroeste published a revision of the cheques issued by City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camachová Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
She also executed transactions with Jumapam, where she collected cheques for over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor state of the Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of foreign tourists into the dreary at the Sánchez Taboada village, the tourist sector in Mazatlan asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada District Traders Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the poor state of streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see disorder, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to shut down a business for one day, and they have no idea of the revenue they're leaking, otherwise they wouldn't have dealt with these matters for so long and without proper planning".
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The town hall will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to do preventive maintenance, not just repair existing defects", he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, for as residents we deserve a clean place, the town hall should change its city maintenance strategy".
There are other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito.
"Today, it is necessary to offer a good product, a city abounding with the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He spoke of a number of places to be fixed in collaboration with the City Hall, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, which will, however, first need to be put in order to make these places more attractive and to put them on the list we have for the promotion of this destination".
IP Requests Results for Congress
Eduardo Davalos, president of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive calls for the business sector in Mazatlan, because Sinaloa is in spasms and facing major problems.
As of yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 of PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and the last from PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalist patriarchs will not be repeated.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the road for a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right, without any agreements between the parties, because they usually make measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions".
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridging, which would shift the ruling forward in order.
"We want them to do decent work and be committed primarily to companies and sectors, because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to collect all forces in an effort to achieve the country's economic growth, as the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will encourage job creation in some way".
As regards tourism, he asked the new legislators to give him more weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned it was a ministry with a second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing value and investment, which, moreover, directly rivals agriculture".
In addition to releasing funds for start-up tourist projects, Congress should help deliver the state on security and help with an alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Three Kings Are Wanted
Dolls, cars and bicycles are along with other toys on the list of children in the Coronad family Valenzuel.
Their parents will find it difficult to fulfill their expectations on the coming festival of the Three Kings, as their household includes exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan, and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar, and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the municipality of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time, because my husband is unlucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... I'm out on the street this afternoon with "cubs", said Cayetana Valenzuelová Andrade, mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wishes a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would have wanted clothes sized for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I wish this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see son' because it was very expensive", recalls the sadness of Cayetana.
For older children who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, aged 11, is a size 12, 10-year-old Isaiah size 10, while 8-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen - year - old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he could use a five - and - a - half - or - six pair.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Looking for Three Kings", and at the reception of Noroeste bring a gift or money in cash.
14 supposed drug dealers who have been arrested
A dozen tours were conducted in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the destruction of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
Tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford, and Stoke, mainly in places that served to make drugs.
"Approximately 750 beds of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that served to produce was confiscated", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Quebec police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, of which both supposed bosses of this entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
Arrested persons had to appear at the Sherbrook Judicial Palace following their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, its possession with the aim of trading with it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections were followed by a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public that allowed us to approach these arrests", said M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional department of the investigation of the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphremagog.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be overpowered while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I rely to a significant extent on the Charter."
"I stand upright on the side of the party that built granite under your feet," declared Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a weekly session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow for detaining up to one year any person coming from a ship, identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was heading towards a bad goal.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do", stated M. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on the immigration issue, Olivia Chow, rejected critics who want her party to be not strong enough in terms of illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree that we should take action against illegal immigrants' smugglers and that is what we consider a substantial part of another bill, C-35", Mrs Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and places children in prison for at least one year", explained Mrs Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
"Canadians mass communicate to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada at gunpoint and treat it as some kind of sycophant."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
In doing so, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote that any Member opposed should answer from his position in front of his constituents.
New Unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigation committee for the issue in question.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, strives to keep this idea from falling into oblivion: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Investigation from New York as early as January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement of many of us surprised.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on October 29, last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
More did not need a public security critic, the PQ side of Stéphane Bergeron, to rate this announcement as a "king pulled out of a hat" and "amateur solutions botched on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself answered those who fear that political power has too much effect on the potential future of unity.
"It will be satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of witness interrogations in a public trial.
"Moreover, Mr Charest is affirming that he does not want to form this investigation committee, and people think, as you and I do, that he is hiding something", explains.
"The only means to achieve the creation of an investigative commission is Jean Charest's resignation", explains Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Political Science at the Institute for Education of High State Officials.
In order to come out of this dead end, he suggested that Quebec be given special authority to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the inspector general's mandate", he decided.
It also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, who is allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government files.
Quebec would also follow Ottawa to change the Criminal Code to be better adapted for this type of crime.
This request would be based on the commission for Operation Marteau (Cladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marco Fournier that the case law on this type of investigation was not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected a group of bikers, despite the fact that the Criminal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had changes made to the Gangsterhood Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several waterways have been under strict control due to heavy rainfalls that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were preemptively evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions hit heavy rainfalls, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters was not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were hit the most.
It could fall a total of up to 100 millimeters.
If we add these rainfalls to the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can worry about floods in some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service announced a warning on Wednesday evening of the flood risk for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood alerts and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière caused heavy rainfall of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a makeshift bridge was torn down as a result of strong rains.
Two residences had to be preemptively evacuated.
In Outaouais the spillage of some lakes from the banks caused the closure of some routes, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Rescue services are on alert and overseeing the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Center issued a warning on Wednesday of strong floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
The Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as gross speech during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "unaccurate information on social aid and inappropriate negative representation of Haitians gross expression that does not correspond to broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the posting of the names of both those who took their lives, did not violate the regulations for radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council received several complaints regarding comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Common Front of recipients of Quebec's social support.
The group complained that the amounts on the air were inaccurate.
Moderators must submit reliable information, not deceptive.
As for suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide could not be understood as solving everyday life's problems.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of "Dupont noon news" broadcast have come across a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no complaint against him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the Haiti earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort therefore embarked on a media shootout that provoked many reactions.
The presenter CHOI stated that he had sent no gift to help the Haitians, because we cannot be sure that the needy will actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an undue negative picture of the Haitians.
"I've already atoned for my three-day delay in this thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years", stated the presenter.
In all decisions, the Commission rejects the use of crude language in broadcasting.
Anyway, CHOI-FM radio broadcasts cooperated "over and above their responsibilities".
For a station which will have to announce these decisions, inter alia, once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, native to Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange run.
Atlet, which excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickbox and Thai boxing enters on tatami and ringy all over the world and seeks new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, I explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008, to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches all over the place because competitions in North America are rare for those who don't like playing on the ground that appears in combat sports."
Recently, this person, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, has just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23 to 30, in Edimburg, Scotland.
"I won kickbox categories full contact and Thai boxing, stated".
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in San shoo".
"They were invited by rivals who finished with the first four at the last World Championship in each category".
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009.
"I finished eighth in 2005 in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the tournament in the fifth rank, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, added."
"The interesting thing is, I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China, where punches with fists and legs, as well as tossing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches take place traditionally on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, born from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
However Nacer Zemmal is to retain only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the supertournaji "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is China's highest and most prestigious, explains a nice guy".
"It's kind of equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four rivals on the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)".
"Winners semi-finals compete in finals of their category".
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that a single champion, king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracts without competitions
Hydro-Québec agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche, more than 100 contracts are a consortium created from BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project totalling $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of Énergy gérance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this significant $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the consortium "Énergy gérance" acquired a lucrative contract without any public tender announcement.
For the Quebec Party, a complaint against a consortium of businesses puts us in a serious ethical position, risking exclusion of competition and raising prices.
"It's a new way to realize collusion and eliminate competition".
"This means that people no longer make side deals secretly, today they already make them openly", said MP PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says he is heavy on how public interest can be sold this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normanddeau, objected this afternoon, quickly denying that this contract would be a collusion.
"I have my own way", she thundered and claimed that the PQ was "unhonorable" and "failed accuracy".
She said that "it would be the least possible" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
This is usually an alliance, limited in time, which allows two or more businesses to group their mutual expertise so that they can respond to a call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of work.
The construction is already running and has to be dismantled by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being allowed to act; it was trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the formula for consortiums in the field of consultancy in engineering is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we fly over the trade register of quebeck companies at speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, with some appearing to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
With regard to the Énergy gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the labor force and that Hydro-Québec has responded to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to dispel the forehead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a tender and if there are few tender participants, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: I.e. you take the people who are in the contract as participants in the competition, and you say, "Let's make a satisfactory deal with a good price."
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of the people", confirmed Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergy gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for over $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for engineering consultancy concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin pocketed 22 contracts, of which Genivar obtained 16 of them, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a share in "Énergy gérance".
All contracts have been concluded.
Together, they count $449,783,344, including a contract with Énergy gérance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that the PQ is also associated with companies that "finance it", before specifying that it is more of its managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the players of sustainable development, but also in "unbiased" brands and environmental certificates, to follow accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst part is that, while we bathe in the media universe, which urges us and urges a more socially responsible consumption, this media universe laments over the lack of credible information, failure to fulfil obligations that it even qualifies as a brake for its commitment, Baromètre states the responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebec residents who try to sell them still do not trust them very much
Two-thirds of us are actually saying that they don't believe in the promises of companies relating to the environment, simply because green advertising by companies is finding a measuring tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates added to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands, which are referred to as ecologically responsible, states Barometere.
In the same way, the debate by politicians on this issue is adopted as serious by just 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount for stimulating this aspect of consumption revived at present by almost one third of the québec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and questionable nature of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after a higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the population of Quebecus is unbelievably opposed to the product data or the "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
All 61% of them favored shopping with traders from their neighborhood and preferred buying food grown in their region, reports Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québek likes to present himself as a recycling king who seeks the least impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and ecological conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, states Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents stated that they were using public transportation or that they recommended using the car to drive at least two people, in order to protect nature.
Walking and the bike also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan to buy the cinema complex eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the cinema eXcentris by Angus et le Paralle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The Developper company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a donation of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to purchase a cinematographic complex on Saint-Laurenta Boulevard and which demonstrated its mission as a film art lover, did not receive what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, whose amount would be lower, some initial expectations that could build the basis for viable solutions on favourable terms and with resources from the state.
The first action plan and demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised for reductions.
The proposal and plan of activity were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Enterprise in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counterproposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallel et Angus have until 31 December to reply.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation from the state must really be rejected.
Let us recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centers in Quebec opposed the state's direct investment in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, concluding that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the premises of his cinemas during ten years of film art after he himself financed the building of the complex, which may have been the reason for the change by the State's Financial Council.
The lack of halls for independent films is loud in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to acquire a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his lead, runs a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that he will spend $700,000 to push through acquisitions.
As of spring 2009, the only of three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and project the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group think about the reduction proposals that are being made to him.
Raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic American sources listed in familiarity through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but in the same stroke they reveal their sense of superiority last named against Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian electorate is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to voting, believing that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, interpreted yesterday as a public spectacle, provide additional sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
A communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great amazement of the U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
"Canadian inferiority complex, almost constant, makes possible political leaders conditional on talking about internal betting rather than realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade campaign), writes.
"The United States are thus", concluded, "a proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous but potentially too threatening to be talked about".
The ambassador understands this "deaf silence" the less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government retains confidence in the vote in early February, regarding the federal budget to which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion", writes M. Breese.
Nowhere does it mention that the government had to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of Parliament so that it could not be defeated by coalition and that opposition parties would make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to an increasingly negative image that is being cast on the United States by dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which he can observe not very subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but based on the principle of "case-by-case".
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "he handed over some paper relating to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, state secretary."
"Secretary accepted with reviewing file".
Finally, let us note that the people involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
It was spread, and so was Mike Huckabee in the United States.
World lighting recovery plan
Yesterday, in Cancún, the UN proposed a plan to restore home lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries in order to achieve a greenhouse effect reduction (GES), which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional limit that needs to be achieved to stabilise the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implement commitments to reduce on the part of industrialised countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the light bulbs that monopolize even 50 to 70% of the market, we replace the fluocact or, even better, the light bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DELs or "LEDs" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would break down.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% of the car park emissions on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them, Canada, were involved in voluntary reduction plans that should allow GES' global emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve climate stabilization at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to rule out that it will not get out of control.
In heated bulbs 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
New DEL bulbs, such as the ones he introduced this week to Philips production - this company reportedly participated in a UN study - have an expected lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of a possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed reservations about fluocompact light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless producers set up collection centres.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact bulb, but rather a thermal coal power plant that emits much mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in heated bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters are circulating 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also sets out in detail the profits that any country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year to buy electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to a 3.5 thermal power plant whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce preliminary results, stressing the UN President's spokesman".
"He asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from taking any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the latest date - Wednesday midnight - to expire three days after Sunday's scrutinium.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of CEI confirmed on television that the commission "continued to work" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the calls for CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round, between the resigning Laurent Gbagbo and the member of the opposition Alassan Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "fraud" vote in the north, managed by former New Army (FN) insurgents since the failed coup d'etat in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the electorate intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country discouraged supporters of the President of Côte d'Ivoire from going to vote.
Elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council had taken into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's supreme court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who dements any association with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations pointed out on Wednesday to the political faction of Côte d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, October 31, as a winner with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassana Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in Metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional seasonal deviation correction data (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has settled at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In the wider range, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but wish to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of current young people on the labour market has increased even further with a new increase in unemployment rates of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, there were 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24, according to the International Labour Office.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in the year), i.e. 482,000 people from 50 years of age above and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only populations aged 25-49 have benefited from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy about its method of calculation.
Eurostat, a European Union statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and taken into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the chief waste-processing companies and brother of the PS Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, purportedly fraudulently acquired.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of the company's assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, provision of bribes, taking bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, states his attorney.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions this one intends to ask him, and not some delusions."
"It is easy to pursue him for many reprehensible reasons, but another thing is to prove them", stated his attorney, Florence Rault, for the AFP, before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but ensure the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of any such thing, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former CEO of Aubagne's agglomeration services, was charged on Wednesday for misuse of public funds and conspiracy, and left at large, under judicial supervision with a ban to associate with, protagonists of the matter.
"My client has been able to give an explanation for all the facts he is accused of."
"The investigating judge takes this into account and leaves it at large", said his attorney, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Another four persons were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with being under judicial supervision due to two of them, reported Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for taking bribes to influence the Office and for passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "disposal and misuse of the company's property", the other for "competition in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, the business associate Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "disclosure of abuse of the company's property".
Among the people confronted by Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies helped to launder money from widespread gangsterism.
The investigation is conducted within the framework of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public procurement, particularly in the matter of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search focuses mainly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the La Ciotat landfill, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille City Community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss Case: Elysian Palace Exaggerated Mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran due to "spyonism", united views in France, put diplomacy on a combat alert and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this was closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents, received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France, and a wanted U.S. justice for fraudulent material trafficking in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they submit to the sharp light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has a headline: "Iran:French comments on how to deal with hostages".
Adviser from the Elysian Palace on Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking with the Representative of American Diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do just as much to be brought back to their homeland by their own nationals for violence detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "severely pronounce "in the media the words "basic rights of man", "innocent", "immediate deliverance".
It is necessary to bring into trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it more the more they ask you to stop it".
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discrete channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters for evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
It announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day the French embassy provides refuge for her) "will require the payment of a high amount of money to the Iranians" (the EUR 230,000 deposit).
And they announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will sharpen".
Iranians could "in the future arrest about 1800 more French living in Iran", he states.
28 August 2009.
Clotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information spreads: The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whom the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released at liberty in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
Like many observers, the U.S. Embassy is asking for this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, who pursues illegal Iranian networks to acquire material intended for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majida Khakavanda is bad news.
France agreed to negotiate?
Freeing an Iranian for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysian palace, as it states, was not only "surprised by this judge's decision", but was looking for a way to counter it.
"There have been talks between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the court's decision", notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Elysian Palace dials a phone number, hangs a phone headphone and then informs an American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Paris's buildings administered by the Iranian Embassy".
At the time of the imprisonment of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysian Palace develops efforts, negotiates, through a communique and organized "runs" to the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "affects" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes media "blest" by French officials".
On what is the basis of such a measure of "gratefulness" expressed against M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements, full praisers of French officials in private acknowledge that they have only vague notions of what the Syrians actually did".
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communication "directs towards validation of President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", analyzes.
The policy applied in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and designated premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria what praisers can earn when playing a constructive role in the area".
The aim is also to "sow a grain of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in him, "of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least bring confusion and ambiguities among Iranians".
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at Elysian Palace.
In the communique, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our countrywoman".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival" that will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, said responsible government officials.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to persons under the age of 16, reported representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have learning problems at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", said Jo Rin, the head of the Ministry, who is in charge of the bill.
The online games will be newly accessed from 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, specified.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents so request, to supplement the worker responsible.
It will also make free programmes available to people who so request, allowing time to be limited on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries, and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
The 2018-2022 World Championship: Fifa sets up host countries.
Full unrest due to suspicion of corruption is established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a selection sovereignly politically motivated, where the struggle for influence and lobbying risk overcoming technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the 2018 Royal Fifa Competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to manage to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to plant in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
List of figures to participate in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leaders of government officials Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives themselves the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets throughout the world.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest it is difficult to establish a hierarchy by candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) dossiers contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not hold too much weight for 22 members of the executive commission at an hour determined for the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the unveiling, leading to suspension of two CE members/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of its country, the cradle of football, which so far hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
On Monday, the BBC put a crown on it when it aired a document that "stuck on a pin" three influential CE members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayataou.
How to make Fif unhappy and bring into trouble English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will succeed in repeating the move that was performed by his predecessors in the capacity of Tony Blair, who managed to win for London the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intensive activity suffice to give England a new shine to its CE name (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, as the pair of Spain-Portugal do not miss trumps of already prepared stadiums, its patronage (the 1982 World Championship in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite gaps in its documentation (stadios, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided that the championship would not relocate to Curich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal innuendo hardly twisted on accusations by the English press against CE members (European Commission).
"We'll throw mud at them, try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite with its considerable experience of 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the seat of Fifa's major sponsors, seems to have a great lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacys seem premature for both countries who had a 'test' together in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which bitterly wishes for Fif, made Asian chances for the year 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, who pulled a big ace out of his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue her expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for poor TV fees (due to a time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for Fif.
Second mandate: clarity (security)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand made the appearance that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The Elysian Palace's mandate calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secret associated with the presidency.
Thus, doubts must be made as if they persist.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, without wanting to believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends made demands that the third mandate should not be excluded.
On November 15, with the serious expression Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "he would decide sometime in the fall of 2011".
As he recalls in front of the members of the UMP on Wednesday evening at the Elysian Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" has sown little feverish condition.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he recalls such meetings in a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years to go with me", he switched in July 2009.
Rebelia in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next leg."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make him a candidate any less.
If they make comments, it is because of the double truth.
Acceleration of the trip to PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolèn Royal's colt that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to incriminate himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to arrange for combat assemblies rather premature than intended.
Bad recon on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the UMP thing," responded immediately and circumspect people from the next neighborhood of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes possible defeat, he will not run", reports Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with obviousness.
Euro: Central European Bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council in the year was to be an opportunity to specify the conditions for recovery from the crisis or, at least, a notification of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European debt no doubt will be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation today already strained on European securities markets.
In such a case, the political price would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in order to address the European States' debt crisis.
She did not mean to say if she thought that the bank could do more, for example by increasing their program of purchasing sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)".
The evening before that, in Brussels, when questioned by the European Parliament Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and he was content to say that the program of buying state titles in the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting that Thursday.
The only surety: Central European Bank will keep its basic constant interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of treasury bonds made by the Central European Bank have doubled to almost EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unreasonableness of the brokers on the market, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, central banks have purchased €67 billion of the system since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the brokers in the anticipation market about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists expect no significant change in course.
If loans operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central European Bank's arsenal, this latter bank shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generous terms and for a period from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean accepting the risk of triggering short-term new tensions", reports Michael Schubert, economist Commerzbank.
"Progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", presumes Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions on the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchase of its bonds to revive the faint market", adds Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the flare of paid performance by states belonging to the most fragile", testified yesterday to a significant bond manager.
Because if interest rates were to take off, the states would be even more worried about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government humps its back
After the start of the week for Italy, a worrying situation loosened a bit, yesterday with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Economic Minister of the Regions, they said they had heard Giulia Tremonti qualify the situation as "unsolvable" and that he was expecting an "unforeseeable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any event, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points, and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) went up to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the derogation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, declared himself "too busy" with the "roaring development of markets" and the possible disease native to Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that he's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and lack of significant fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
Brussels' last predictions were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public finance deficit will represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From there, a reputation for a new summary of the supplements to the state budget proposal, which could be introduced after the holidays, of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken", says Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy accepts support from international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time", states Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, nor short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% gross domestic product of 2011, the NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the efforts required from other countries", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE's chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face the motion to voice mistrust to the Chamber of Deputies, and then the elections that are expected at the end of March could begin to be organized.
This would start a period, little suitable for taking a decision in a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde emphasized this again last night as part of a press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans demonstrated it on Sundays throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solid determined, engaged to defend their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, regarding interest on European state bonds, brought water to the mill for governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Office for Notation Standard & Poor's announced that it could degrade the record of Portugal's debt, a goal that focuses most on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and obvious policy, mainly based on banking systems", says economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so that "political time runs slower than market time".
Consciously, this interrupted link and the dangers it conceals are intensifying European countries' debates, aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected issue, and on a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
With regard to Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroupe) and Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The Central European Bank is held today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, denied a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday, in order to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this path is not intended to increase funds, it is thus preparing the soil to achieve this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, the U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilized funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
First of all, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are attached to strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid have different ways than Greece and Ireland have used.
At all costs, both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on structural reforms necessary to regain lasting trust.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bonds markets.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that EUR 750 billion would not be enough to be mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock of securities again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, an actor of the very first trading plan for European sovereign claims, conclude that an addition of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
There is a means: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized by €60 billion on that date.
A Council that has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange alert.
Snow rations still cause difficulties in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties now have an orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined 20 counties that already have a declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, considerable snow surges cause problems in the north of la Gironde and the forest Charentes and it snows weakly on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and from 1 to 3 cm, from 5 in the Paris region.
The counties of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The influx of snow is large enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the Côtes d'Armor coast, some counties have banned the passage of heavy freight traffic - trucks over 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and police recommend leaving with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardy on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no special measures are foreseen to limit freight traffic.
The District Authority "calls on all car drivers to be as careful on the roads as possible and to adapt driving to the nature of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights to Roissy Paris Airport on Thursday and 10% to Orly due to expected snow surges.
DGAC recommends that passengers, using air transport services, contact their company.
In the UK there are closed Gatwick Airport in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: First Financial Proposals
It has rained billions since the debate on the modernisation of transport to Ile-de-France is in full swing.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
For this construction to be launched, the state announced a subsidy of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source on its contracts.
Today we are finally getting to the first amendments.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which examines the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and increasing office tax on Ile-de-France.
The first, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The income from this interest is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists because of "to be upgraded, to increase the yield obtained from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
A mirage.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're four billion away.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are attached to EUR 4 billion from the capital subsidy, which will be mobilised by the state and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project", we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
This system does not seem shocking to us at SGP.
"From the moment we created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then go up to 4 billion, it explains here."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as needed".
SGP considers that the 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised still belong to absent beneficiaries, risks creating a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Vengeful hackers and complicit spies
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be only a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and it predicts a future controlled by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the Secret Service (any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" of Americans about the way Berlusconi's sex life has been announcing what everyone could read for months in any newspaper (all but these two Berlusconi own), and the infamous cartoon profile of Kadafi has long been a theme for cabaret artists for sketches.
The rule that secret documents may consist only of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Temple, or Brick) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like to look for new information (or even know where to look for reports about non-existent ones), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before.
That's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be an editor in Libération), who considers only what he himself admits to be true.
Highly classified information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the state resort, was the same information Newsweek published the week before.
Why, then, was there so much fuss about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can make calls or fly an airplane to a dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that only out of laziness is it seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly shames the obligation of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most heavily classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard hit, not a neglectable, for the prestige of this state resort.
Scandal affects both the victims and his "executors".
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to assume all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every move of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been shown since, thanks to the ability to control every move through the phone, every transaction done, a hotel visited, a used highway, and so on, became a citizen of the complete sacrifice of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even "graves" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control report becomes one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as the avenger of a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can he maintain a power that no longer has the chance to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is an unencumbered secret (and an unencumbered secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, unencumbered secret because it is taken out of public life; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was inextricable secrets, means taking away all power from it.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this plague given to the powers so great?
Obviously, in the future, states will not be able to send on-line sensitive information - this would be equal to its publication on a poster posted on the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that you can keep the message secret over the phone.
There's nothing easier than finding out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and teamed up with one of her colleagues.
How will private and sensitive news be kept secret in the future ?
I am well aware that for the moment my prognosis is science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I must imagine government officials transporting themselves discreetly to perform formalities on uncontrollable routes and carrying only those messages that they know by heart or rather conceal precious information in the heel of the shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in drawers sealed by a key: in total, the attempt to spy in the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, that is backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) allowed cinema lovers to capture the film step by step, to move it forward and backward and reveal all the secrets of assembly while now CDs (digitals) only allow them to jump by chapter, meaning after macro-proportions.
Through the speed trains, we arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours while travelling by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
So it is not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques return to horse-drawn vehicles.
One last comment.
Other times, the press tried to understand what had been plotted in the secret embassy.
They are now embassies asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test compliance with promises for quickly unblocked funding (said fast start funding) or premature financing, implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks have been revealed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (that is 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU drew a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its fast start funding commitment: a report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, grand side event, distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation priceless and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would want all developed countries and civil society to do them the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it on the right track to keep its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is put into effect without harming the Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for three years to the title of fast start funding.
Other countries have selected similar references with annual payment dates or with public development aid levels.
By contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the overall amount of support from France towards developing countries may remain constant (or even decrease) to keep its commitment to financing "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the division into donations and loans.
There is not yet a rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that €1 borrowed is equal to €1 donated.
Clearly, it is hard to prove: efforts are not comparable.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not see it as the basis of our commitments, but as the cost of the loan to a creditor country (i.e. the interest rate equivalent).
But France can only provide such a justification: it 'complys' with its €420 million commitment, making it 91.5% loan (€389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that makes use of the loan on such a scale.
Germany claimed 46% from there, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) adhere to their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts €1 to satisfy its promise, France only gives 10 centimes and considers this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful conjurer's piece!
For the summary, when financing a "fast start", France operates with double fraud: on the one hand with the development of the share over time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it only spends EUR 36.1 million, it can convince itself that it issues EUR 420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (as it seems that it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, simultaneously within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when it is enough to lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The pre-financing chapter is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate debate series.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce the change in its way of keeping the accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and decency and justice vis-à-vis other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France should avoid discussing long-term funding contributions (another fundamental chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the issue of 'additionality' or the way in which loans are recorded.
France should change its position to become as progressive in these deposits as it is with others.
So everyone is putting hope into the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Koscius-Morizet, who arrives in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of 'additionality' and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that children eat.
A ten-year-old child eats 81 different chemicals one day, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex- Movement for Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The Association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processing issue", purchased food commonly consumed in four meals between July and September and one light meal as a light snack for one child roughly ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as sugar confectionery, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are among clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internal excretion glands (PE), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we can well see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminated substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking", says the Association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain by itself about ten résidies with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including in France banned fungicide.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch for which studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steak, canned tuna, and even bagels and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In water from the tap analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave oven did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "contaminant cocktail" is likely underestimated", results from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greening Society (EE-LV) proposed "to face an emergency situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the situation of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
