Petr Čech: Change at the last minute?
Anything is possible.
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance won't come until winter.
Petr Čech, currently the substitute goalkeeper Chelsea, does not fit the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting at the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talking to Czech journalists and is preparing for a Czech representation for a game rehearsal with Americans and subsequently also for a sharp start qualification about Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In the chelsea goal in the new Premier League season, Thibaut Courtois gets the preferred, Bohemia for the first time in ten years at the London club became an understudy.
Some time ago, there was speculation that Real Madrid might be interested in Bohemia.
He lost the Spanish Supercup in the duels with Atlétik in the early season and failed to even enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He took out two wins and two draws to the French League season, shooting St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively, the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance in the league so far, and he broke up with Lille at 1-1 on the weekend.
News came out on the tabloid English website today that Bohemia might want in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, Chek's last-minute retirement from Chelsea is not very likely.
Skybet put a four-to-one on him.
Peter, is it possible that you'll change your jersey in the next few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never anything 100% in football.
Maybe during the day, there'll be an offer that won't go down.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
There would have to be a consensus on all sides First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position whether the club's offer would be addressed or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new assignment?
I didn't think about it.
But there's a lot of players in a situation like this today, and they're all somewhere in representation meetings, and I'm sure a lot of transfers are going to close today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
And you're not pushing for leave?
A situation where I did not catch a new season in the first three games is a new one for me after 15 years of career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack and go anywhere.
I want to continue to participate in the goalkeeper Chelsea competition, and it's up to the coach who he chooses to make the decisions over the next few weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision?
I'm taking all the factors into account.
Of course, the sport aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, which of course belongs to the family's needs.
Is it possible you'd be hunting for another club in England?
That's a question I never thought would concern me.
But anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect union organization as a civil right.
"According to the way the unions operate, middle-class jobs work," says Ellison, Democratic Senator for Minnesota, co-chairing the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud to present, together with the role model of the occasional rights of John Lewis, a law strengthening the status of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal possibilities to prevent discrimination from being organised in trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and to stop anti-branch forces
Adapting the Labour Relations Act to allow all workers who face discrimination, if they want to participate in unions, to sue in a civil court - and to sue compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other legislators are proposing in the law is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country, with one breath, promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, including language, and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to collect, negotiate collectively, and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisors urged the Germans to form a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced with strong democracy.
Realizing that employees would need to organize and promote in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that openly states: “The right to form societies that will ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed for each individual and for every profession or profession.
Arrangements that restrict or seek damage to this right will be abolished. The measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, it included in it the promoters and Roosevelt guarantees that “everyone has the right to create and enter into unions in the protection of his interests."
Americans for generations have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When countries advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in a position of equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being contested in America, it is certainly necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that unions have not reduced the power of the nation, but have expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living for millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unknown level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights so as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis restore the ideals that lifted America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisiana law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
The regulation enacted by the signature of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's resolution means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions, and in the meantime they must obtain this authorisation.
"The proposing party will be able to perform its activities legally and in the meantime obtains permission," states Federal Judge John deGravelles' resolution.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution concerning the law.
The abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, and said that it would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision ensures women in Louisiana will be safe from a sneaky law to deprive them of health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerns doctors from two clinics who were not among the plaintiffs and also asking for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional by provision.
Key parts of the Texas bill that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked by federal judge on Friday.
Women's abortion rights fighters, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permission places medical requirements on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion opposed that measures aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed due to measures.
The Reproductive Rights Center reported that only one abortion physician has permission in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, said the group.
The Louisiana authorities said in response that they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while awaiting processing of the application for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video with tribute to their deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In women in Australian countryside, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than in their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of over 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% of five years after diagnosis lived.
Research head Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute stated that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines can slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers monitored women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
In women in rural and remote areas of the state, about twenty percent were more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynecooncologists who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of distance medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today will be published by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mother Elisha Neave of Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline of homeowners under 35 could lead to the loss of ten million pounds a year when today’s young consumer generation reaches “the main gardening age group.”
According to the report, people who rent their homes spend an average of 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own homes.
As other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated £5 billion per year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of pre-gardens used as parking areas and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the proportion of houses owned has fallen from 61% in six years to 43%, one household accounts for the lowest spending on gardening products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society stated that housing in sublet or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the head gardener’s advisor for RHS, said: “In tenants, growing plants in pots is very popular - when they move, they can take plants with them. ”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales for this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin rescued the atomic weapons at the reunion of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all, and basically showed everyone that he did not care about their views, he gave us a lecture today on democracy.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia is showing many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both strained nationalism and the complex of inferiority can transform into imperialistic appetites.
Time flows in the east, apparently not in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war over Europe was long gone, in the East it believes that they have been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazi’s grasp of power, and then followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike that of today’s situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the liquidation of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that's certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians, probably miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other half trembled before them.
I guess Western politicians brought this on themselves, maybe they didn't pat Vladimir on the shoulder enough, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He cleaned himself up at home, pretending he didn't even want to go anywhere and sharpening knives at home.
Now he's decided to take back the lost position.
Starts slowly, he's got time.
The leader is probably a life sentence, so where would he be in a hurry?
He tramples the Caucasus, now he tramples the Ukrainians, then the Baltic dwarfs are next.
They've been pinching a Russian bear's fur long enough.
China will notice that by now, which is getting too high and is definitely making a long-distance quest.
And those Germans are really pissing that Vladimir off, too, how well they're doing, and we put that on their ass at 45.
Let's do one new Novorosija in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base, and there's a lot of ours, and as they're being oppressed there, they're already trying to take down some of them.
After all, our veterans will still remember how they were doing in Czechoslovakia.
Well, that Prime Minister of Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, he can peel like an onion and eat the whole EU of them.
That would be so much for them to come up on the great Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And as detonators, we'll use our comrades who live on their territory.
There's a lot of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed there, they're just being oppressed there, and we're not gonna let them, we're gonna protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, for what else is he born to do?
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition to which Ivan can be proud to dance a Cossack.
Turkey called a U.S. diplomat over a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said American charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept reported that, according to documents provided by a former analyst of the U.S. National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has bagated the importance of the report and stated that all major states are watching each other.
The older report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction to the Turkish government.
The series Game of Thrones introduced other tricks of the fourth row
The creators of the Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth row were created.
The most visible are computer modifications of the series environment and mass scenes, when a large army of famous Daenerys becomes a group of soldiers.
Chief of Police in Magalufu accused of corruption
Complainers on Friday presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the Calvia Autonomous Region.
The Chief of Police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested following allegations made by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magalufu.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after being charged with corruption by several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballen, a street in which most bars and night businesses in Magalufu are located.
According to the Internet daily Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion to the Mallorca Prosecutor's Office to combat corruption by police officers and city hall officials in the Calvia Autonomous Region.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police due to a connection to the corruption charge, and together with Navarro they will be interviewed by a judge.
The Spanish national daily ABC cited disgruntled night business owners, according to which favouring public officials has serious implications for their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," said one of the entrepreneurs in court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist appeared on YouTube, giving oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to supervise drunkards and rioters in the ranks of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where there was an event with the provision of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and along with the tour organizers of Carnage's bars to pay a fine of 55,000 euros (73,000 dollars).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many drunken accidents, including the fashion wave known as “balconing”, in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide Airport
Spring brought an ice surprise to the south of South Australia, came with heavy rain and fierce winds that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm rainfall is due in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm is due during the night on Sunday.
The last rain presented itself together with several short showers associated with storm and gusts of wind, which began before 8:00 p.m. and in about ten minutes brought nearly 4 mm rainfall.
After a few early doses of spring came after the winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to just 15.8 °C.
Storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land shortly after 19:30, but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction, and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane must have dropped from the second landing and finally landed at about 20:40.
The aircraft's delay subsequently caused additional flights to be delayed, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to the forecast, the temperature in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli Children Return to School After the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, missiles and mortars attacked their homes.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in southern Israel, but signs of struggle are still evident.
In Ashdod, a town in the south of the country, the kindergarten staff hit by a rocket removed debris from the wall and slowly expected children to return.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, resident of the Saad kibbutz and English teacher at the local school.
A lot of children in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart revealed that "it's a little strange" to go back to school at once.
"We've had some hard times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to residents.
Until last week's ceasefire ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and went to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, in which a missile from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, hesitates to return.
The Minister of Education stated that about twelve families still did not return.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study diligently, adding: “We will provide you with education and security. ”
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an unlimited amount of time.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key problems as a requirement for Hamas to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers fallen in war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of the killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired mainly 4,591 missiles and mortar missiles in the south of the country during the fighting on Israeli cities.
In turn, the Israeli army took more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in a hundred United Nations schools that turned into makeshift shelters.
Due to tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and due to ongoing struggles, school officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old school boy in the largest city of Gaza.
The willow at the reunion: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu is troubled by the temperature
The Czech football team met today before noon in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of a 23 - member cadre, Spartan assailant David Lafata has problems with his temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David probably has a little more problems.
But we want him to be here and be all right as soon as possible," said coach Pavel Vrba to journalists.
"If it's two or three days, or if it's fit tomorrow, we'll see about his health, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some pain, but it's not like they can't train or take part in a match on Wednesday with the US," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba summoned as the last player Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, but other midfielders were also involved.
I decided on the basis that Luke was a promising player who was 25 years old.
It was very difficult to decide, but I stand by it," Vrba pointed out to Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend, for example, the Liberec Josef Šural, who gave a hat trick, flashed a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata's doing.
If he cannot be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot dominate any of the players who took an interest in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a representation of training in Strahov, Tuesday then classic pre-match training in front of a duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by an autographing session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday at 20:15 and the national team in it will seek a premier victory under the Willow.
In the previous three prep matches, he played two draws and once lost.
The qualifying contest with the Netherlands is then on schedule 9 September from 20:45.
Pešice goes to Italy on the Netherlands
The willow is glad to have more time for training than previous reunions.
It's an advantage when you have eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we haven't had that much time for before.
Now we will only be able to concentrate on getting ready for the Netherlands as best as possible," said Vrba.
Before the match in Prague, the Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday and the duel will be personally followed by former temporary representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us information that's from the match.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have the game and we're gonna have the game and we're gonna take it apart.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent World Championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the prices of flats in the winter period have increased most in the last seven years.
According to the housing index in the Australian capital of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, said the agency on Monday.
The increase resulted in an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9%, more than twice in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne run the market.
RP Data figures show that flats prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin with an increase in prices on average between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was placed, which was damaged by the state-ordered reduction in expenditure and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when spring began now, the number of properties for sale would increase in the following months, which would be a “true test” for the market.
"In view of the continued high level of auction sales, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands in 1958.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry tries a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the tune is optimistic.
Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through thorough therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: “Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were adults - they went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass with beer or the beauty of a strike in cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner reading the papers.
Recently, Henry visited Dudley's foundry, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he saw what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light in there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where flames go off and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad would always get in the tub and just lie there, then you could hear him slowly singing for himself, because he'd wash the foundry out of himself.
As I was walking by, I realized he was doing this for years to support my family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started thinking, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Will you stop with the "I love you" thing?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
French, whom he was married to for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and started showing symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said to me, “You have to make a radical change. ”
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I had to take a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiresome.
Nobody wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of taking away Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut chin.
After receiving credit from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theatre.
A Comedy of Mistakes and the Plots of August Wilson followed.
It is a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
The DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “I was the only black impersonator/communist on television for a long time. ”
He was learning on the move.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make up working jokes, be a star and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
As his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry in it eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was nervous about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on great scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "years and years of acclaimed major product of British television", but was also "the grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known among other things as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him commercials, documents, television series, and roles in films, but after broadcasting his series LennyHenry.tv to the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, it seems a little bit like you're stuck in one place or a little bit out of the way."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it at school, and I thought it was something for white middle class.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 lines to the documentary from Othello's closing speech, and he was already in on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me courage.
“That’s what it’s about. It’s a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was tough, and I read the game months and months ago.
And it was a success.
They looked like they were going to get in trouble, which they didn't.
Soon he began to play in Comedy full of mistakes.
All of a sudden, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for impounding the audience.
"The voice in my head said to me, 'Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now.'"
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Well, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle this for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry at the Plots at the Duchess Theatre
Learning Plot lyrics was a challenge.
Panic's pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course he's saying it in a SECTOR'S VOICE.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Henry's brain remains a comedian all the time - he interrupts our conversation with humorous performances when he enters and steps out of the role of impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I guess.
If you're always looking for something, you can hit a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it like I used to.
I asked if he'd ever organise a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps give outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to look at non-existent employees
Kenya began a biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove the government's non-existent employees from the payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who are not registered in the next two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after they have left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars ($700,000) per month on non-existent employees' salaries and further abuses of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited on bank accounts even after the employee's death or after the civil servant has left, reported a BBC reporter from Nairobi capital, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must come to the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, as stated in the government statement.
He further says that anyone who does not show up without an apology will be eliminated from the payroll.
"By determining actual public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waigur, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government."
The police department hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, fourteen senior officials were among the detainees.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation into corruption, which focused on government officials including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone eavesdropping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the actions of Islamic clergyman Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents as well as Prime Minister Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1.
There's no peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All Ukraine, the combined Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a schoolteacher in Slavjansk, attended by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for a tough time.
He carries with him clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclaves of conservative parties.
She has experience on the front lines herself.
The career began at the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she was executive director of the Financial Times, resigning from office when her junior colleague took the top position at Pearson's parent company.
They say her severance pay was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
It was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former BP director when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the government office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the director's work as a poison cup.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside to the top layer of the hierarchy of its own BBC leadership, but also out to the public voice at times of restlessness when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But who would risk coming to a firm as complicated as the Chinese dynasty, decomposing it and thus depriving himself of his job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the competition and the new technology questioning old certainty, immediate negotiations on licence fees for the BBC are at great risk.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public buys a stake in something that is certainly the largest media business in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each costing only 40p a day.
Moreover, the BBC’s popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters compared to 31% ten years ago.
The models of using BBC services have changed: Today, the headlines appear on my mobile phone and on the shows I missed, I can watch the iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to remain a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing principal - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the offensive tweet did not approve
Tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry's official twitter account, published on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a democratic state attorney who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and another one was posted in Perry's account, which had distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that wasn't authorized left my account.
"I don't agree with the tweet and I pulled it down," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for its administration.
A previous tweet published an unflattering, humorous picture of State Representative Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry denied disbursement for her office, bringing Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, this month brought before a grand jury in Austin.
The tweeted: “I don’t always drive with three times the level of alcohol in my blood than the permitted limit... but if I do, I will sue Governor Perry for calling me to account for it.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry wasn't conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was designated by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked a judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut off $7.5 million from the State Public Interest Fund, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active, and sometimes he gets famous.
After finishing fifth on his party committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be ending, tweeting with his own photo running near the lake, and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is going back to normal.
One of London's most prominent development companies warned that the housing market had "returned" to normal levels of activity in south-eastern England.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for Berkeley demanding clients, said Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to a normal level of transactions." He adds that it provides a "stable environment for functioning."
The London housing market was doing well during the fall, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the data of the cadastral office, prices in the city rose by 18,5% over the past year alone, far exceeding the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
Average selling prices of private, affordable, and student housing by Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, foreign buyers of London's property have not been so attractive in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and the talk of possible "housing tax" that politicians came up with before the May next parliamentary elections.
Last week, London's real estate agency Foxtons warned that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, would also slow the growth rate of the market for both real estate and price sales during the second half of the year.
The new Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages per month of July, indicating that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has, on the basis that house prices have already begun to decline, reduced its forecast of growth in London real estate prices to 3% in 2015.
In the meantime, according to the real estate agency WA Ellis, the volume of transactions has declined by a quarter each year in London’s most expensive neighborhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital for Berkeley was a blessing, as it increased cash for forward sales to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, good - looking housing in a good location remained the same, and this kept forward sales. ”
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of April to the end of April, almost one third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before Pidgley's annual meeting, he said that it was anticipated that Berkeley's annual revenues would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley shares stopped at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th edition of the Academy Awards.
Oscar holder Jennifer Lawrence's photos leaked online because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of other hundreds of starting actresses.
The talker of the Star of "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "obvious privacy violations."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who has stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker photos that were originally posted on 4chan image sharing server were reported to have gained thanks to a gap in Apple iCloud's internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took in private homes years ago are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, known from the cable television series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were genuine. On Twitter, she said, "These alleged nude photos of me are SUBVRY, people."
It's better to put an end to it. *intentional pun*.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that the spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs were genuine.
An extraordinary demonstration from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel on love and the letter "J"
They disbanded, which is the best way to describe it, gradually decayed like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, too complex, too sharp, too isolated, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He conceded.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was a beginning love affair that more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild mane hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came south with an older companion, whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, who inherited property in a damp but magnificent valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the baths, slugs were lyin' on windows, as if they thought it belonged to them, the garden was overgrown and the weeds resembled huge cabbages.
The house looked like a children's story house, scary and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary nomination list for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A closer selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat in long grass sofa chairs holding hands, enjoying an unexpected warm spring afternoon, unwittingly tuning a public station that supplied the county with comforting music and comforting news, when the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to with his blinds closed.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs were no longer played on radios.
They weren't forbidden - really they weren't banned - they just weren't played.
They helped them get into the dehoutude, as well as the word dehoutudo itself.
People's taste has proved what they could never do with regulations and standing outside the law, and just as people choose memoirs in terms of books, in which the poor man becomes rich, cooks and love novels, ballads are chosen in music.
Kavern was torn down by the day and began playing the imaginary piano and singing with a rude, comic voice serenade to Ailla's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a popular song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, adding two fingers to his lips automatically.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started out like a game when he was a kid.
Father told him he played the game with his father.
When you put two fingers in your mouth when you started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't very funny back then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard one.
Not even jazz, even though it wasn't directly outlawed, played.
Improvisation went out of style.
There was only room in life for one "if."
When the tunes started, people wanted to know exactly where they would end up.
Same with humor.
His unpredictableness has gotten on people's nerves.
And jazz was the humor expressed by the song.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior until ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillen didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember a time when the favorite singers were not black.
No law or coercion, either.
A permissive society is one in which each part of it is grateful - with the gratitude of those who were accidentally spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean descent, with temperament and constitution, were suited to entertain and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People native to the Indian subcontinent, as if nature was gifted for electronics, assumed responsibility for not being a family without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed, washing dishes.
Those from the Gulf States and Levant whose grandparents quickly did not leave the country, while what was going on was going on, if IT HAPPENED - they feared that they would accuse them of adding to the fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would spend the next time - they opened up a restaurant where they sold labneh and smoked water pipes, they didn't draw attention to each other, and inaction slowly consumed them.
Every man according to his talent.
As she listened only to ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the dirty words that Kavern had just sung to her could produce music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really dirty," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of security.
Not a word could escape from behind the sound-tight leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He was going to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said in the end.
She shook her head incredulously and overshadowed Kevern's view.
In the whole wide world, nothing could be seen but a jumble of her raven hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly feet.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too soon.
"I'm just attracted to your fat ankles," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble because, like his father, he lacked the spell necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Kavern was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from the deckchair, dropped the radio and spilled the underdrinking wine.
Bezino wine, so it wasn't drinking.
She seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in the storm in her excitement.
"I'm sickly attracted to you for being a jerk," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her both because of her unkind words and because of the fear she had in her eyes the moment she faced him.
Did she think she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that in the basics it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean criss-crossed them.
The same deranged men, then, WHAT HAPPENED, even more touchy and grumpy than their ancestors, smugglers, and spoilers, wandered angryly from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who would dare refuse or mock them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to cuddle her - to cuddle her became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to faint ballads about love that the radio spouted - first to cuddle her, then hit her with one.
According to Kevern's view, excessive cultivation because cuddling was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him nonverbally to leave.
He got off the couch like an old man.
She herself felt resentful, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched as she was leaving - as if she was watching him from the upstairs window - the man who was caught up with what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart gripped because of him and all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her up.
The man turned away from her, shoulders hung, shamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel like she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember a single moment until today, that she'd ever seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her legs.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate violent acts in the areas of the country where it was mitigated or stopped directly, most expected if enough money and energy were spent on its removal.
"A lot has been done and a lot still has to be done," she wrote, "to calm down the inherent aggression of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the embroidered, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the tips of church towers rising over hedges, a touch of human kindness has rarely appeared."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories, and claim to firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only does old brutality hold as stubbornly in rural areas as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and aggressive intolerance appears at home, in the workplace, roads, and even in sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to have too much flowery style," said her superior.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme retaliated with her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"I don't ask," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I had something against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We're not prejudiced in this workplace.
We serve unbiased societies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is completely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you did.
Obviously, you yourself are biased towards the church - things you call "cruesome" and "brutal" could also interpret as expressions of natural power and energy.
Still dealing with what happened when it happened, as if it happened, if it had happened yesterday, preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light board was a pink flickering recommendation, which Ofnow broadcasts to the world for the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, make a deal, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the sung word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she was sure that her superior had finished, "and I no longer claim that the wound had not healed as we imagine it had healed.
My first concern is that if we are not warned about this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened when it happened.
But this time, we won't be venting anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz linked the ends of his fingers.
That was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe mistakes as taking the steps that may have taken and maybe not making your grandparents.
You go too far in talking about venting their “rage” and“ distrust” on “the others.”
I shouldn't remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we don't talk about "us" and "they."
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we are honest with each other," Esme took courage, "no one is blameless.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Fair or not, whatever happened, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt that can be blamed on anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But what good is the past but to learn from it -
The past exists to forget it.
If there's anything I can add -
Luther Rabinowitz broke the ends of his fingers.
"I will take your report into account," he said and released her.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was struck by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk in a way described by passers-by as “brutal and furious. ”
Coincidences happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesoth claims no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Forest Kingdom denied having organized a coup for the purpose of overthrowing the government, claiming to have acted against police suspects of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army surrounded his official seat and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
After saying he was threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family left for the neighboring Republic of South Africa.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, a spokesman for the Army, said that it was not really a coup, but an army response to the threat of “political fanatics” that police tried to arm.
"This morning, the command of the defense forces of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are several groups in the police ranks that plan to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to wreak havoc in the country," he said to the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power through force, the actions of the Lesoth defense forces appear to bear signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesoth said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane stated that, in his view, he was the target of the attack due to his efforts to combat corruption in the country.
As of June, when Thabane suspended Parliament's session due to internal disputes, there has been tensions in Lesotho.
He stated that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his actions to the government.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of 13 months
Production growth has slowed to a 13-month minimum, according to a closely observed survey in the euro area in August.
The final index of euro area shopping managers (PMI) from June 51.8 dropped to 50.7 in August.
The number above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have decreased and the factories have damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures come from the Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant to 0.3%.
There have been speculation that ECB director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to that of the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty have on producers is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist Markit.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month minimum of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has again switched from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," said Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to the fire to analysts awaiting the implementation of other monetary or tax stimulus.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August shopping executives’ production overview is that it shows that the sector is still growing. ”
He added: Producers in the euro area currently have a very complex life, because increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to increasingly challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably affected trade - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He stated that the ECB would eventually have to do some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of Hell survivors from Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at the school in Beslan, South Russia
More than 330 people were killed during the three days of suffering that shocked the world, more than half of whom were children
We returned to Beslan to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school's atrocities.
Exactly ten years after the terrifying cast of the school in Beslan, in which 334 people died including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance over the tragedy united east and west, which in this disastrous calamity led to action and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, southern Russia, to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at school.
We have found wonderful young people who have defied misfortune, even if the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live in them.
What's their greatest wish?
The war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - will be over.
A girl trying to get back into a ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as only in her underwear she tries to climb back into a bombed school gym after a bomb exploded in her.
Confused Aida desperately sought her mother Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
I had blood on my legs.
I got up and climbed back to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
I have pieces of shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly did not destroy it," she said determinedly.
“It just happened to me, and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Gapoev, were killed there.
We used to play together when we were kids and imagine going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about family later.
She says she didn't forget her capture, but her memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and from other countries.
Looking at my picture on the Internet, climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped through the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia, children start school at age seven) and survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, a seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, ran, and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran off with a shower bullet.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me his mother was dead. ”
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in a hospital with a wounded leg and, on the contrary, thought her son had died.
After meeting again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World newspaper), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared winner Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories are fading.
I remember right after I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play computer games that shoot, and I don't have a problem with it.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember kids I used to play with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember a trip to London well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted at the toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine where he suffers as much because of the war as he and his friends did.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for everyone who has to go through this horror," says Damir, who participated in volunteering at the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work with the police one day, and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there were no children around here screaming and running, and the silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers the trip with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's appetite for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think there have been, and a lot of children will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up, and he's a nice, quiet kid, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to think about it, but he's very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember him sometimes lying on the couch with his face away from us and sometimes lying for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember he threw out all his guns or other toy guns.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and I saw this hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember shouting ‘Damire, run, run!’, but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go further than others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose picture was taken after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Consolation: Survivors from Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack on the right Grigory today
When he ran for his life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was embedded in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to drive his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists raided the yard, so my little boy stayed there alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's getting harder to think about and talk about it.
Not a day goes by without remembering the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Grigory's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory was so excited about school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I learned that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino, there is even a statue of the weeping Grigory.
Grigory doesn't like to look at that picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that this picture makes people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Grigory says today: “It’s important that this doesn’t happen again.
“I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
Such tragedies are still under investigation, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is in for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
To forget just a little bit, it takes decades.
It had an effect on my health, I can still feel it.
I had a nightmare for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
When I then returned to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why when September 1 comes, I go to the gym.
I want to honor my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and began to study medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregorij Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was captured trapped in a gymnasium sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it were yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put behind me.
I'm older now, and they say that children can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006, I went to a psychologist and felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - this was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I passed out.
I'll never go again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in that well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken at the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like thinking about it or talking about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful of my knee that I hurt, but I'm walking normally.
But I still couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg for health, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My other hobby is animals, so I got on the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something that kids should know about, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, stated: “The pain will always be here.
He's inside, and he's getting worse with his anniversary coming up.
I'll take part in the memorial ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God he gave it back to me, there's traces everywhere in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he's carrying on with the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's over the fear of 50%, but he can't get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and it only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and loved.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose the killed.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him at the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now coming to our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could pick up all these rebels and throw them away as far away as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child taken to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyon Tskaevu carries to security Russian special commando (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all.
The world caught its breath in 2004, when a Russian policeman carried little Alyon in his arms from the Beslan captivity.
The terrorists released her, but in captivity at the school gym, they retained her 30 - year - old mother, ten - year - old sister Kristina, and brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a little girl named Kristina after a dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend stated that “he is a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories he commemorates for the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in underwater shooting or shooting, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family celebration with several cameras, they all cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Further set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or filming mode that optimises exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you do that, find out how deep you can dive in with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, another up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by purchasing and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof design.
Take a few shots every time - a lot of them don't work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with the composition of photos, but outdoors don't.
Even if you have LCD, under the water it will be poorly visible and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more shots.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure variances, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
As the light sinks deeper, it decreases considerably.
If possible, stay in the pool, lake or sea near the water.
This will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's excellent advice if you're shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the damper light.
It is particularly important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a firm and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality power was able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the sick from the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, treated patients in the overwhelming majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He faced the flu symptoms and found that he was impatient, and his wife Juliet included regrets.
He noted: “I want everything to happen sooner than later. ”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
He had been skiing in the French Alps for two weeks before.
X-ray results came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects pleura or the lining of the lungs.
Most types of cancer are hard to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fibrous material previously referred to as “wonderful, ” but it is now known to be fatally dangerous.
It wasn't hard for most of us to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belong to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry entered into force.
Even at the time the asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as isolation treasurers, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in the industry in another era today is hard to appear to be cause for concern.
Such complacency is not appropriate.
As it turns out, today the mesothelioma epidemic is peaking in Britain.
The number of deaths on mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from this disease per year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the UK
The reason why we feel its effects just now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not just concern veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases it is still present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we shop.
Thus, Mesothelioma does not respect the social strata, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged bastions from London's department stores to public schools do not constitute shelter.
Parliament is full of asbestos, too.
Even hospitals where we should be treated are the storage of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even set up isolation.
He was trying to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and doorkeepers - used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were on the practice at Guy's Hospital and who then manifested a mesothelioma in the past five years," he remarked in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
Sickness is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get sick from the same disease? ”
According to Britain’s leading mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
In a brief look at the files from the archives of the courts to which the disability often turns and requires settlement, it shows how widespread the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she had negligently exposed asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised in two stores on the clothing section - one of the places was the company's flagship, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children who are in their 20s.
"Before it happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed he'd have anything to do with me.
There aren't many people who know anything about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given due to its fibrotic structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
The most frequently found in buildings today is a chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO still regard it as a “great health risk” that can cause death.
But brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (stepydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]."
Employee Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pet's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient studies claim that “a substantial portion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A significant part of this exposure is due to "common use and weathering" of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not suspect that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that service lifts and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms are contaminated with asbestos, whose fatal fibers could be breached by something as harmless as "a strong stream of air."
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Parliament's Services insisted that Westminster Palace be given a "primary medical certificate", it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to examine Parliament thoroughly, to modernise electricity and to remove asbestos, and that, after the 2015 elections, Members will be seated rather than on the Green benches in Westminster in the premises of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Centre.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations. ”
It is impossible to say whether this disharmony will cost lives.
Everyone can now just wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos was shown to be present," he says, "but in my case, I can't prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a chill.
He was 45, he was in the evening, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly, I was shaking.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't driving home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from pleurisy, linings around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
In the end, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent out of his lungs for analysis.
Still, they didn't make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he practiced and took a breath.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the OR and subsequently was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and was in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray scans with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera probe was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of the lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year's: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began dating sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"Asbestos has been shown to have been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to manifest the disease.
Thus, Mesoteliom is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous tubes thermally isolated by asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, members of staff who crossed the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement cafeterias (such as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with toxic substances.
As it now turns out, several decades after the hospital war, they were a place where they could save patients' lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is being removed to this day.
Pupils built Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city hall due to its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos mat.
A website dealing with asbestos in schools was created.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s when she was tearing down a garden house.
So be careful how you tear down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found out I can't concentrate on what I'm doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was the transition from doctor to patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
“ I asked my doctor, “How much time do I have left? ”
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I won’t live to see another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
Mesoteliom is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - the very breathing - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos form tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks and fibers breathe, they can settle in the pleural, lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate pleure and may cause cell mutation.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
The asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “the breath itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
Its nature has been invasive from the very beginning.
Mesothelioma is not the most common treatment option used in other cancers.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is being debated hotly.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “does not respond very much to chemotherapy, ” which “has some effect ” but does not cure.
"Sometimes there is someone who survives lung cancer," Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After finding the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advisor for equally affected people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: “Hello, you have reached the cancer center. ”
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with illness four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last for four months, and would probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “has shown things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and they would have to approve his payment.
In order to get to the best available treatment, the question of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments eventually fail, many patients face further financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," Morgan says.
In the 1960 ’ s, however, it was found that even its very small amount could pose a health risk.
And this is where we meet the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full-value settlement" because Lawson could not prove definitively that the mesothelioma was the result of an asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating the case, however, the spokesperson Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbest in the incriminated basement section was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Seducing exposure to deadly asbestos to one firm or place of work - usually decades after that - has proved a huge problem for patients with a mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces changed owners or went bankrupt.
Insurance records are missing.
And those who now defend themselves against the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been passed this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek settlement, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
The law created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve, which is covered by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disability will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally charge them as a settlement - approximately £120,000.
300 successfully completed applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks £350 million is "good work."
"It's an agreement drawn up by insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they hadn't intervened in time and people with mesothelioma would be able to track down former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that due to seven deaths each year, quick action was necessary.
"People suffer too much and need help right away," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the Mesothelioma law.
Graham Abbott was under the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that unlike Tom Treasura thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - triple treatment, in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast of survival rates for five years up to 40% of patients.
Abbott got stronger.
"Of course that's not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it with patients all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The check-ups showed no signs of illness.
I went to another check in March [2014].
I had a few stains in my chest.
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It's not life-threatening.
He's into it.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his body.
But it's both physically and emotionally exhausting.
You need to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you find out the bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not lightened by hope or only by a hint of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually also brought Stephen Jay Gould) unhappiness certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “the mesothelioma does not threaten life. ”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the authority to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
Despite the growing debates on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
It is likely that this move will trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began to organize and prepare just a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to take out any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We were not surprised, but angry," said the legislature Emily Lau, chair of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Li Fei National People's Congress said that allowing public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership election would cause "chaos".
As of 1997, when Britain returned the administration of Hong Kong to China, Beijing promises that starting in 2017, residents will be able to vote for executive power.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decisions as a democratic breakthrough, as Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that China’s leaders are holding firmly in the hands of the nomination process of a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be permitted.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of the largest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are supported by the Central occupation movement with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them a general voting right.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government seat.
At the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their Internet statement, organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as a final step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice left.
We must regret to announce that all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted today, and the occupation of the Centre is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, strengthening the protection of the government's seat and deploying police officers and barricades on Sunday.
The instigation of unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Centre occupation movement and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - a Hong Kong lifeboat.
"The protest he talks about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who criticizes the movement in the long run.
We don't want the fear of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
China's state media has also in recent days come up with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong portray as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, to which 780,000 participants came - over one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the area's history.
A pre-election agitation?
The league in Jihlava wears the name according to the political movement
A small football is played in the county town of Vysočiny by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is newly named Together for the Jihlava League.
The title was given according to one movement going into the October municipal elections.
In addition, the tenth candidate is the head of small football in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," Mrák said.
The situation around the first league small footballers had already been dealt with by lawyers of Jihlava City Hall and recommended changing the system of subsidy distribution.
The little football got about a million crowns according to the city's website last year.
This year, it's an amount of hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the procedure of a small footballed is not contrary to the law or regulations of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to regulate the rules for awarding grants and subsidies," said the spokesperson for the City Hall Radek Tulis.
Draw subsidies from the city and at the same time express as a small footballed support in the election of one political party, it probably won't work.
A similar request from politicians has not yet come to the high-class "big" football.
That the ČSSD would have been formed by the regional championship, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be in favour.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from companies to turn to us," said the chairman of the Regional Football Union Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of the small football of another party and the movement will not let the name of the league
According to small football players, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the playground Na Stoupách is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ondřej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Český mlýn.
However, there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a senseless area for skaters, which is about fifty in Jihlava," Mrák pointed out.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymaly (ODS) responded that the little footballer uses artificial grass fields in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning to upgrade or build sports facilities near schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been huge progress in recent years for a little football," he added.
Other political parties in league names will not appear according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field enters our partnership, we don't put the other one there anymore," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider this at least an unfortunate step," said member of the City Hall Sports Commission Karel Voldán.
"But whether the electorate evaluates whether Mr. Mrák is using the Little Football Jihlava association and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jet planes
We are happy that we can answer the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including private jets or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service has a security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
With our VIF (very important freshman) variants this year, we look forward to ensuring that students arrive at the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
The company’s spokesperson said that since the services had just started, they do not have any reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks. ”
The company also stated that although students pay an annual tuition fee of £9,000, they expect the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
However, the national student union criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Higher Education Union, noted: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students entering university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as coming to college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behaviour after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri killed an unarmed young man.
Presenters waiting for the funeral chant with their hands up: “Hands up, don’t shoot! ”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri to shoot unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in online discussions between white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists favor gender over race.
With increasing tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noted that white women’s reactions focus on race at 100%.
Compared to black women's reactions soon after the 9 August shooting, personal articles with headlines such as "the thought of a white woman over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privileges at that level," she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves to what happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we face, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially resolute that they had to point out this.
According to English professor at Ohio Korith Mitchell State University, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-American women face every day and which are not perceived in the cultural sphere as "female issues".
"I can post funny stories on Facebook about life with my partner and get 150 likes from people from all over the world," said Mitchell.
When I write something about the color being trapped in my own country, it's a silence deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who dealt with the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no question of race and gender dichotomy.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: each day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today share the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor lecturing the female question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
lynched between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of a white woman.
According to Hattery, the split between white women and black women came when the campaigners for electoral law like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - can have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet cards on the right to vote for women and on the right to focus for black people later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to start organizing against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the questions raised in Ferguson - the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “catch up” on the questions that black women faced by generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists on these premises [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" said Mitchell.
A second wave of feminists who made a career fighting for reproductive law and access to contraception now find out what it means.
Notable feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, who demanded that white Americans protest more strongly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions on race that differ significantly in public opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates inter-sequential feminism, which includes issues of race and sex, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
A scholar at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book “Who Stolen Feminism? ”, she told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “many more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the comments made by Steinem’s Ferguson parties face criticism that she had provoked earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a little My Brother's Keeper program that was supposed to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it triggered angry reactions in many feminists including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied teenagers in the southwestern country this year, the question of reform has re-emerged by immigration laws - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercad, co-chaired by We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration law reform, said that in order to raise the question as necessary to women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have voiced in women's organizations," she said.
The residence of the pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed a picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig rested on it in the living room.
The one-room separate house, which is for sale for £120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the sofa pig.
The real estate office Connells stated that the pig in the photograph is the owner's pet.
"The photo was found there by mistake and was therefore already removed," said the office spokesman.
In real estate information, Connells described the former prayer room as a "only-born separate one-bedroom house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
Lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, one lucky man taking $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery haul home.
Trafficking in Harvey had luck distribution for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 it was a prize of one million dollars.
But the lucky winner still has to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the entire town in the southwest of Perth is talking about winning.
It's the main topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a win like this was a touch.
Eight winners split one win in Western Australia last month, culminating in a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, the player at Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said winnings would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, total winning $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn's trains won't go tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose time off the rush hour.
The chosen time of the strike takes the GDL into account many people returning from the weekend by rail only during the first working day.
At the same time, we think of people arriving for work during the day," the union said on Monday morning in a press release to announce a strike.
"Our first strike should hit mainly freight transport, less passengers," added the GDL.
DB has not yet released an official response to the strike announcement.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions demand an increase in the wages of the engineers by five percent and a reduction in working time by two hours per week.
At present, the average wage of the engineers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year depending on the years worked.
Drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept salary increases when working time is reduced.
In doing so, they stress that the wage valuation of the drivers must evolve as with other railway personnel, for which DB does not count on shortening the working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he finished at the Barum rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn't think anything like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be fixed on a provisional basis and continue at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were to head straight there, yes.
But we had two more stages, and we couldn't.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can't afford that.
You've passed five speed tests at full speed.
What were your impressions of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were quick, and I didn't go over the vine.
Everything was caused by the fact that we've been banging the car for over six months to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You put it in a way that you could actually think of winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we could really win.
Work wasn't wasted.
On the other hand, the result that we could think of did not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the tops who stepped down early from the first-class battle.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring, and Lappi also fell out of it.
Were you surprised that so many favorites stepped down?
Yes.
It was a pity for the audience especially because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, whom you are preparing a car, has long moved to the top.
But he paid for him to fly off the track and pick up almost two minutes of manko.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the podiums.
He's been going through the first two times.
But even Mira confirmed that the car was well-prepared.
He was driving really fast.
You announced the end of your career exactly a year ago, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular rally racer?
I'm sure not at the moment.
Last year, I said Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't keep it.
I've decided to go again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there's another chance in a year, I think I'll do it.
But that's all I'm thinking about.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Did that please you?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking me if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumce?
The team continues.
Next week we're going to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't damage the car too much here.
Besides, he wants to borrow Jan Sýkora's fabia for this race.
Mira and I have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to prepare for that next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally belonged to the World Championships, you reached your maximum in the series in fifth place.
Aren't you tempted to try the tracks again?
He doesn't.
An oral agreement with an employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you didn't get a doctor's certificate of incapacity, which serves as evidence for the organization that you can't perform your duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify your employer of your absence.
Subsequently, although there was an agreement that the days would be registered as a holiday, the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent to take up leave in writing, this practice has proven itself in practice.
If there is only an oral agreement, you have no confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the drawing of leave, as in your case, denied and absent at work may be considered as a long-term unexcused absence, therefore the reason for the immediate termination of the employment contract under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In case of a court settlement with your employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you was not cancelled according to Section 53, you only have the dates listed in the credit sheet as an unexcused absence.
The unexcused absence from the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the impossibility of receiving material security in unemployment), yet the possibility of finding a new job is difficult.
We recommend you to see the doctor again and have him confirm in writing that there has actually been an accident, which has made you unable to work (it is not an "inability", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity and the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to take leave.
You will avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident returning to the track
Returning to the track finished for Tony Stewart just a short walk behind half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race track.
Stewart struck the fence for the second time after his right front tire burst in the 172nd round, and the race ended for him.
Stewart drove the wrecked car into the garage, didn't comment on the reporters and left.
His team chief Chad Johnston said car team No. 14 is disappointed, but will now focus on the Richmond race, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the first time in the Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
"We had hoped for a good ending in today's race," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at the New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to catch up with the place in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, which drove Stewart into the way during the race.
Authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion had warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he worked his way up to 10th and then even 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, drove out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars to the fences.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to the 21st place.
Prague selected a new taxi habitat manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tender procedures for new taxi station administrators.
For 103 parking spaces, it earns approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, for the same places for taxi drivers, she collected CZK 150,000 a year.
Alderman Luke Manhart (TOP 09) informed about this.
Previously, the city used to draw lots in the selection of administrators.
The winner then obtained a lease for a lump sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently decided.
"A year after the termination of original lease contracts and the opening of tenders, the new lease system has proven to be far more advantageous and fair for Prague overall," the councillor says.
The most expensive spot is on Perstyna
The highest price was offered by candidates for a post in Na Perštýně Street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million annually.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million were paid by new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxi stations were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they denounced the original lease contracts.
The selection procedures were held in four waves and a new administrator found 29 habitats.
For the second time this year we had to clean the well.
We let it out every time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the basement always provided plenty of beautiful fragrant water.
And that wasn't exactly professionally done, Grandpa scooped her out with self-help.
A long time ago.
She was just about three hoops and, overall, unique, like everything else on the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed like the water didn't smell right.
We were wondering if anything had fallen.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, there was not quite a load, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing could be seen in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we've released it again and refined it.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky package on the ground with some bones on it.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a slobbery mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where the vents are, Grandpa's invention, there were remains of fish!
And it's going hard!
Our basement is also unique.
Some would say Grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just smothered sand, only the ceiling is smothered.
It's mostly boats.
And the wheels.
And beach chairs.
The gate with wide gaps was mostly open as someone walked in there all the time.
At the ceiling of several already mentioned vents.
Without a net, so birds fly there and build nests on beams.
There's no point in mentioning mice.
Grandpa wanted it to go wrong, and he wanted it to go wrong.
Now, of course, it didn't help.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We've thrown out stuff that's been around: boards, heraclitum boards, that sort of thing.
Our long-distance cabin greeted the passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering who might have pulled the disgusting leftovers in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She'd hardly come to our house to have a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
Didn't he put the disgusting things in the vent?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to keep an eye on the cellar and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, just for washing and washing until the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water out of a forest well is nothing I want to do for a long time.
We once heard a terrible, anxious bark from our bitch.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The rose leaped over her and whistled like a fool.
Mom scolded her because she thought Réza had dug a garbage hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose was partially twisted into a ball and partially straightened.
There was a hissing on the balcony.
Rheza's having a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
The snake, over a meter long and as thick as a bullfish, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Réza defended her.
It wasn't clear whether she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the power of our family, she probably thought we should eat it when we were so hungry, and she snuck into the basement gracefully.
We went to see her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind a well.
By the way, we noticed another stinking package on her record.
Smells like a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit tricky.
And we locked the basement during the day.
That...
We went out, and there we all lay down at one vent.
We didn't wait long.
The well was a mess.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow periods on its neck.
Then a whole snake went up on the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to conquer inside.
A fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
After being released, a disgruntled employee bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He was able to spend the money he received before the police were apprehended.
Within a short time, the man purchased in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"Notebooks were taken to Olomouc after the takeover, where they were sold by bazaars," said Rostislav Brückner, Chief Commissioner of the Šumper Police.
The motive of fraud was revenge on the employer for dismissal and also profit money.
"In the interrogation, he told us that he had used the money for loan repayments," Brückner said.
Police also found out that the impostor was a pathological player who had repeatedly been treated in psychiatry.
Money could thus also end up in winning devices or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," said the Commissioner.
An impostor who has already been punished for theft is now threatening to live in prison for one to five years.
So far, the police have not informed whether there is a threat of punishment to the bazaars that bought the laptops below price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over brand new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, a little bit more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the target to the floodwater, instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race along with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
My team and I decided to greet our readers personally at the stand where we took pictures and made videos together.
To bring my view from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of personal conductor.
My friend Katya and I were obediently placed at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the launch.
We greeted our friends who were passing us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of warm-up boys, turn on the athletes, countdown, and start!
Shouts of exultation, but instead of a quick start followed the brittle to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurements and start at an hour ten.
We are interlocking with the yellow snake runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
Meanwhile, they all look fresh, the slowly descending sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost a cheesy breath.
The pulsating meat stretching down the embankment looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
Traditionally, on the embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it begins to show who has the strength.
A light hill on Palacky Square forces many runners to slow down or cross into walking.
Just before the race to Theatre I see a police escort flying right behind him Vítek Pavlišta at an incredible pace to the finish line.
I hear the admiring puffy sighs of other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, encouraging him, about to give me a high-five, but just before that, my leg goes under and our hands just misses.
The Theatre Street event gives you a chance to take a short rest and breathe.
There are places in front of us where the views will blow my mind.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my feet are carrying me almost alone.
There's a moment of truth behind the first refreshment.
During the crossing of the Katya road, he skimmers against the curb and performs the jump swimmingly.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues through Kozí street, it is one of the narrowest places of the track, at this stage of the race there is no longer such a rush, but it is still necessary to keep an eye on the surroundings.
I don't know yet that the term narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate, tourists and friends of other runners frenetically encourage us.
I try to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata, because ten claps with fans are like half an energy bar.
It's really working, we're accelerating again, and even though we've fallen pretty well, now the fighter ride has begun.
We're ahead of dozens of runners, when I pass someone especially tired, I try to cheer him up with a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
After the last refreshment, no one's getting ahead of us, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but you really need to push.
The sun is slowly setting and the end day is symbolically slowly ending the race.
Last run to the bridge, turn and just a straight line to the finish line.
The pace we're running is surprising to me, where is this coming from in that girl?
"Come on, we're under 13, we're working!" I'm calling.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
An hour of thirteen and six seconds.
Well, whatever you can do.
Coach set an hour-twenty.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Close to the goal, Kata breaks her legs, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from well done performance.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of target space.
Euphoria doesn't make us think of the push in the walkways to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that Goat Lane wasn't the narrowest place.
That's the goal of a navigator that's under the influence of nearly 10,000 runners crammed to the point of bursting.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for them.
Even after a while, I lose my mind and wonder if the beautiful views and compared to the previous years, the more interesting route was worth what was going on in the finish line.
I know from experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If 10,000 people add to this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year's route change showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in the Yellow Spa was transferred between runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random viewers escalated it on every metre of the track.
Unfortunately, during the town run by the historic center, obstacles that cannot be removed must be reckoned with, but the target of a mass race in a place bordered on one side by a wall and on the other by a river, I do not consider it the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I'm looking at it as a very good one.
I was a little concerned about the health of those involved, but in the end everything worked out fine.
Write to us in the discussion if you like the route and what you say about the situation in the destination.
Prison overseers in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison service employees throughout Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest rally outside the Department of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their request to reintroduce the original working conditions that have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The overseers symbolically protested the new working hours for the month and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although prison overseers' unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, they informed Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
"The negotiations are still ongoing," said BNR head of the General Directorate of the Rosen Zhelyazkov Prison Service.
Prison Service staff protests are also expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Workers' Trade Unions at the Ministry of Interior.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them
Physicists usually don't write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University managed to hit black in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the caterpillar problems dealt with today by a number of theoretical physicists - an attempt to unify two well-functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
Undoubtedly, one of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is that the search for a unified physics theory is not a boring story.
Physicists solved the basic problem between two key theories (although at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solve so imaginatively that it is worth retelling to both laymen and laymen.
Moreover, Greene dealt with complex material so freshly and engagingly that he could not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
Moreover, he corrected his "mistake" for the most part in the next two books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential to what an informed layman with ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that it will be a little more live in this area over the next few years (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas") and so it is a good time to enter Greene's non-violently open door of the modern physics world.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound foolish, fantastically, strangely, or mystically.
Yet it is specific and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes from space as a whole for a moment to something more silky, specifically a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you stretch the 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and follow the entire scenery from a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From this distance, you can easily record the length in the horizontal direction of the stretched hose, but if you do not have sharp vision, you hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its large distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at that moment, you answer it with only one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a mile away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we see suddenly the second dimension - in the shape of a circle of a rotating hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is evident that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a already well known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimensional in/against the direction of movement of clock hands", i.e. around the circular cut of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you have to enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle of the winding hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note experts notice that this chapter focuses purely on the faulty string theory.
The non-violent aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, dimensions in the direction of the perimeter, marked by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the casing of the hose is short, "screwed" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
The above example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they're divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or small, coiled, and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we didn't exactly overwhelm ourselves to reveal the "convoluted" dimension of the casing thickness of the hose.
All you had to do was take your binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only reveal the coiled dimension with great effort.
In 1919 the Kaluza sent Einstein his article, in which he published with a staggering idea that spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of our familiar dimensions.
Kaluza justified his radical claims by providing an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be vetted into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The immediate question is how this observation of Kaluz goes along with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which he clearly expressed and specified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, large and slightly visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize at every moment.
But analogous to the circular perimeter of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, firmly coiled into space so tiny that they have remained hidden from our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stick to the hose for a while.
Imagine drawing a relatively dense line of circles on the hose circuit.
The distances still look like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now thanks to the drawing, we will reveal the coiled dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, so together, four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let us note the illustration of Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we increase the view of the geometry of the space, as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each following level, represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are rolled into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not seen them directly yet.
The square network depicts the commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circle shows a new, tiny, and coiled dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - just because of clarity, we only plotted them into intersections in a square network.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common standards as meters, depicted by the side of a small square in a square network.
On each picture below, we will focus on a small area of the image before; we will enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, if we move further along our path to microscopic properties of space geometry - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we see suddenly a new, curved shape, similar to a loop of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that the additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of the large dimensions similarly as the hose has a circular circuit at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we only plotted the circular dimension in some, regularly placed points.
Figure 4 of Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space summarises.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have only drawn two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
What's even more important is that we're talking about spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular coiled dimension is extremely miniature, recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - much harder than observing apparent, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will, in fact, be exposed beyond the powers of our most modern enlargement tools.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just a round bump within normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustrations mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three normal large dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of the top-down, left-to-right and front-to-back independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position we would need four data, except for the three usual still positions in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for an e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz's and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional convoluted dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a meter.
The smaller coiled dimensions can hardly be observed.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas from just born quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could have a size of approximately one Planck length, that is, a size far beyond the discernment of today's devices.
Since then physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions by Kaluzo-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: Episode 5
The whole essence of the "Twelve" lies in a twelve-stroke harmonic form that you can freely repeat.
Whoever fumbles in music theory finds its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating a puppet master and a puppet conductor whose Facebook profile can be monitored here, he has been living as a graphic designer since graduation 20 years ago.
She is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which is said to be impossible to walk away from.
The guitarist takes after his father, just like Brother Matěj, leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one string.
"The technical model is only for you, you can invent anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of the 12," Honza advises.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza do what you can with 12 harmony on two strings and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you put on the third string, you can flirt with the tune of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for the tuning change, Honza warns in the video.
Next time, Honza returns to pentatonica and you try to fix her up with just 12.
Then practice it honestly.
As best you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, it recognizes Hradecký Dvořák
We take the point and we're happy for it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," said the striker, who scored from the penalty kick this time.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but he was being accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't particularly notice it, though on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You settled the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal out of the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the beginning, we were passive, we came from the corner, and then the penalty.
You got up after her, and the first half you were a better team with more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the goal we played well until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the landlord said something about their play during the break, probably not happy with it.
You only scored on the pitch for the first time, while you may not have even received a goal at home.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was wrong of us, Plzeň, that is another category.
Four games you were waiting for a goal, weren't you worried that it might be similar after the last game?
I don't think so, but of course we're glad we don't have to listen to talk about waiting for the goal since last game.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet a big celebration.
Island - lava flows from a mile away crater.
Lava rising to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a mile away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact concerns scientists the most now...
The situation remains constant for now.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) is still flying out of the crack of approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel might open even in places under the ice.
If so, with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá a Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur in the vicinity of the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rising from the cracks.
This is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much larger and there are also many more gases," says Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no wind in the area in the morning hours.
The trail of the sandstorm was washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations, the orange stage (second highest) applies to Bárðarbunga and yellow (third) to Askja.
Heaven over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She took a walk on the wings
It's an air day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, Peggy Walentin, an aerobatic acrobat who climbed from the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings, presented herself.
There is only dependent on muscle strength.
The flight day in Cheb took place for the fifth time this year and the organizers managed to prepare several interesting aerial pieces again.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking on wings" performed by German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his glowing cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originate in the US.
After World War I, many former war pilots were thus trying to assert themselves.
But because of a large number of fatal injuries, he was banned.
Today, however, it slowly returns to the air days program.
Peggy climbs from the cockpit to the upper wing after the launch.
That's where he performs various exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, she moves into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Luděk Matějíček of the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E aircraft is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the following performance of the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the surface with the Grippenny Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so called on numbers).
Air fans in the Czech Republic could see such a line-up for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with a 1945 aircraft.
It was still made during the war, but probably never attended it.
He was included in the Army Reserves.
Since 1963, he has served in the civil sphere.
Even as a raceplane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiště.
At the same place is also another pearl of Cheb air day, a two-engine Beechcraft C45H Explorer.
At the airport, the massive machine didn't miss.
Its polished aluminum coating shone into the distance.
He also won the Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colours of the French Air Force.
A small transport plane jumped for a reneged Turbolet and from the German Hofu brought a part of the German delegation on an air day.
German neighbors performed in Cheb with reconstructed aircraft Both 18T or three-member formation of biplanes Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: A Dramatic Return in Front of the Camera!
At least for tonight, Lucie Borhy traded her parents' concerns for work.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde presenter obviously doesn't know any of this.
She was doing well as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since blondes ended on six weeks, in which women experience the most stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not be showing up regularly in TV Nova's main news session.
The regular return awaits her according to the information Bleskl.cz for a month.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than TV viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black shot.
Exhibition for a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out. He's planning a bye-bye, Jager.
It would be dignified if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union will stand up to this," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which a stunning Nagan team met again.
Even players who participated in the gold hattrick.
Players would like that, wouldn't they?
Absolutely.
It would simply be good to say good-bye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they can be found during the tournament for one or two days, when it's all clear and where such a match could be mixed.
We'll tell Gum (Jiří Šlégra) or Béď Šcherban (the organiser of the Jihlava match) who would take charge of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
So if I come in...
You don't want to play in representation.
Or did the Jihlava meeting alter your decision in any way?
The representations and exhibition matches are two different things and the representations are decisive performances.
One thing is, people would love to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially at the World Championships.
That's where the players who are up to it should go, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagan reunion?
Just the meeting with the players was great.
You've lived up stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the tribute to Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Will you still remember your first representation match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we joined in one three.
It was the first representative start for all of us.
Well, there's no way we could dominate it.
Dominik Hasek caught in Jihlava after a long time.
What did you think of his performance?
I'm never surprised by Hashan on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagra for the reasons he decided to end up in representation).
Even Rotten did a great job.
He was training with me one night, and there was a leak.
And now he's been a wonderful catcher.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, the footballers start the qualification
There were prominent guests coming to the NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see the goalkeeper Petr Čech of Chelsea, the representative coach of Pavel Vrbu...
And over there, the character in the black cap, that's Thomas Rosický!
Arsenal's retainer and the captain of the representation arrived at the reunion around 11:30 between the last.
We have a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" he said, when already in the representation kit he stepped up in front of the press.
Czech representation programme
Monday, September 1: start of reunion, first training
Tuesday, September 2: Training open for fans (18:30 p.m., Letná) Autographiade (20:00 p.m.)
Wednesday, September 3 Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday, September 9 Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of meeting
Rosicky and spol. can support fans before Wednesday's match against the US (20:15).
The representation opened Tuesday's training for them, starting at 6:30 p.m. at Letná.
And he will be followed by an autographing session that Rosický and Bohemia will not miss.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be calmer.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who has just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now let's focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage to have a player together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been the case so far," praised Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech football representation will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The representation has three matches under the willow, all preparatory.
With Norway and Finland, she tied 2:2 and lost 1:2 to Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
It's just now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for progress at the 2016 European Championships.
It would, of course, help the Czech team if it could even handle the generals against the US.
The first six months were for us to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," the Willow agreed.
The only player of the 23-member nomination who has health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he hadn't been able to recover by Wednesday's match against the US, coach Vrba would have called in one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how, after misdiagnosed for many years, she thought she would die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was a Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK charity said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
In the United Kingdom, around 23,000 people are believed to suffer from CMT, which may manifest motorcy symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy gait, and twisted toes.
Infirmity or pain may also occur in the affected, this condition is incurable and progressive, meaning that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be tied to a wheelchair, and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was thirteen and was after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought by the time I was 18, I'd be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was on my own and I was planning a funeral."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her walking ability had not worsened as much as she expected, and asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up and hugged her and said: “Honey, I don’t think you have the disease, or you’d already be in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening."
After passing several genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The CMT UK Charity Organization launched a month of CMT information to draw attention to this disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington region: With the turn of the economy rising taxes
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxation of firms in a country with accelerated recovery of the economy increased slightly last year, and firms in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia combined made $22.6 billion to state and local cash registers for the 2013 fiscal year, which is 3.8% higher than $22.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - state and local - rose 4.3% to $671 billion last year compared to 3.9% last year, and it was the third consecutive growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, shows proportionally the smallest tax revenue from the business.
Researchers argue that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which has increased by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years with a growth of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York, and Texas, the situation seems to be the same in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Origin paid over $10 billion on both state and local property taxes last year, representing a 4.2% annual increase compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not so much drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax represents less than a fifth of company taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax accounts for almost half of the state and local taxation.
"There are a lot of real estate companies in Maryland, especially the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organizations that don't pay taxes," Douglas Lindholm, Center Executive Director on State Taxation explained.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to data, income from business also seems to be increasing.
Companies in this region have posted a $2.3 billion income tax that has increased from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, most of all in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, local tax burdens on entrepreneurs do not grow in these three locations equally quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national average level, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the increase in taxation was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has 6 % of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation) of companies' income taxation.
The rate of taxation of companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and overall a more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the State continues to meet the income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to up to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - the cost-increasing structure, according to which most companies are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, rose by 20% to $2.4 billion last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and national increase in business tax are likely to continue next year, with total sales income for both state and local governments increasing to 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may lag behind others because the reduction in state spending is taking its toll on the labour market.
What You Missed: The Chief of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's New Russia, and Lafat's Scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorusk
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the southeast of Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is, according to him, contrary to democratic values.
According to him, ending the conflict depends on Kiev, so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has claimed the right to disagree with part of
The European Commission, together with the diplomats, is to propose a form of further acquitting of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, decided on the night of the EU summit.
The reporters were told by the permanent chairman of the meetings of the Member States of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for shifting the form of sanctions are to be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye will be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU President, who manages the summits of the Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuy will be replaced.
At the head of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Secretary of State Federica Mogherini.
The Italian, who will thus become Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament in her capacity.
Assisted death is reality in the Czech Republic, just not being talked about
Helping an incurable and long-term sufferer with a life-out?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is legally impossible.
Yet, the expression of the doctors who approached the LN indicates that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The Hardest Chapter of Neurology, Says the Doctor About Sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of approximately 300 people, 21 patients undergo experimental treatment with stem cells in Prague's Motole.
We definitely don't know if it's going to be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
There's a CIA manuscript in it, they needed a war, Huml writes about shooting down MH17 flight.
ČSSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the harsh sanctions that have been declared with regard to the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead have intentionally caused the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislature, it also makes you know the CIA's handwriting.
Unfulfillable promises.
Elections are coming up, and the parties are again offering the impossible.
No more homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and cable car above Prague.
It is repeated before each election: the parties promise the impossible.
Now, too, with the forthcoming municipal elections, politicians are overcoming who will be more pleased with voters.
Lidovky.cz selected unfulfillable promises from both the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkerque.
A severe siege began
It was on August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander Alois Fox has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
Finally, the British Party complied and ranked this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of German troops.

How to Survive a Vacation Return?
Take your time and get some sleep
The last days of vacation are ahead of us.
Getting used to coming back from a sunny beach or cottage to a normal working pace can be a tough one for many.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are good tips on how to cope with the changed situation: not rushing and giving yourself a good night's sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "We're holding our thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she was not losing hope of recovering an 85-year-old comedian.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in today's statement.
Fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services, according to which she experienced a cardiac arrest on the Yorkwill endoscopy on the Upper East Side, as reported by the source.
The doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious.”
Reactions to each other did not wait long, including incredible support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted subtitle
That the media twists reality with their subtitles is not (unfortunately) any news.
I know the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, more apt is the word that pisses me off.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text will you read that Israel's "attack" was a reaction to fired missiles from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
That's when the headline "Both sides broke the truce" comes up.
Does the journalistic community realize that by this process it is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not just there)?
Not even 60 years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who survived the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish swine" and similar travesty, I was stuck.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler didn't?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews they were destined to be destroyed by the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to destroy the Czech nation and delete the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also realize one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live on the territory of the state of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go among their own, like Gaza, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security, and top health care (I myself saw how the Arabs often go to the top private hospital Hadassa, which is funded from the sponsorship gifts of Jews from all over the world, and are naturally treated there).
Hamas is also attacking his Arab brothers with their missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled area, is to rid Hamas of it and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Inform about Hamas' practices, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Please inform that Hamas aims to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform that in nine years of Gazan self-government, this area could have been flourishing through humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which, of course, Gaza administrators do not pay and even get upset that at this time, power supplies are occasionally interrupted.
Had Hamas not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to penetrate Israel’s territory, but, for example, in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals, and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived considerably better.
Amazon buys for $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed the claim Information from Monday morning: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys for $1.04 billion ($970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement triggered a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, selling Twitch Google for a billion seemed certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, who only founded Justin.tv three years ago, was on the verge of becoming a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online game broadcasts to it - in the words Business Insider "YouTube for live-action gaming".
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube are already popular videos of "Let's Play", a kind where the wise men (mostly older) give the games the processing of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes to a lot of shock when describingTwitch, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch didn't get anyone very excited was a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is a statement by CEO Twitch Emmet Sheara: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our society, have the same values and long-term vision and want to help us fulfill it faster.”
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who claim they prefer to do sports rather than watch, it is hard to understand what is so amazing about playing instead of actually playing just to observe.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder at 3:00 in the morning playing Resident Evil, and it's another thing to watch a stranger get 20 head shots in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from a player's perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games, in which Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time complete the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone isn't a master of acting or humor, his channel on Twitch is probably not going to be very interesting.
But what do the skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth on top of internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to use this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch blends into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that every firm would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As the director of Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, "they believe in the future of games," and the media does not seem reluctant, even as - swallowing - viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
Attached to the original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things contrary to their religion, they often put us before the question: Who will you trust?
The Alleged Word of God or the Word of Man?
It's as if human examination is completely meaningless compared to the authority they imagine has their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to the word of God, they refer to the myths of God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator with some purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be he who has added another series of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
He seems to be trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, they can fabulate.
And it was people who wrote all those lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictation of angels, but those lyrics were written by no one but mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of that size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture holy.
It would be known anywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors could not measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to trust her blindly because she would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to unite the common faith.
If it was written by God, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into increasingly separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each in some way claiming God's guidance, regardless of the ongoing dissension and separation in every direction.
Jewish Torahs, Christian Gospels, Islamic Qur'an, Bahá'u'llah's Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathushtrov's Avesta, Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true God" and the respective believers of each say that the others are in error.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is in some degree in error.
None of the above books has any advantage over others.
None of them have evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I am a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historical accurate.
Of course it's not.
You must still have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defensives), because they contain irregularities, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with each of them being able to contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written with human hands and thus are the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced bound politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and discrepancies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more of a mutual comment.
We must point out once again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five "Mosuse" books and Moses do not attribute authorship to any of them because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered out at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
There is no way the Bible is as old as its believers think.
Dead Sea scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a diagnostic faith, followed by docéts and ebions, and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups as luciferians were disbanded and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these arrangements refers to King Ugarita, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord on the Mount" changed to Belzebub "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently amended for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of committee decisions at a Assembly in Nikaji.
The four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected simply by raising their hands, as if the fact of any thing could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of that time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
Thus, the core of the canon evolved from the narrowness of the primordial church.
So the council simply accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that circulated between uneducated masses at that time.
But they also consciously took more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were reported to them by books that were approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved in this way if God were the true author of this random mixture of reputations, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by humans and certainly not by much enlightenment, rather the contrary!
That's why so much of its contents are historically and scientifically completely mistaken, no matter what it is from beginning to end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believe in spells, blood offerings, ritual spells, bewitched objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to put blood on someone, it would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants, and bats are birds, and whales are fish, and pi is an integer.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they'd give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing of what it contains at all.
As a moral guide completely fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is contrary to the Bible, then reality must be ignored!
Why?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't even have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshiping creation instead of creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and at the same time the Bible could be wrong, because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations like these books are God himself because they think they're HIS word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposedly "invariable word" of any god has been exorcised, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited and often deliberately altered and distorted by mere erring people.

An attacker in a Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of whom died
A man named Chen, according to the agency, New China violently broke into the elementary school building this morning and attacked around 10:30 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen subsequently killed himself by jumping from height, said New China, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
Therefore, the public calls for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one descendant in accordance with government policy.
Zeman showed first-graders in Lány how he had to sit at school
The smallest schoolchildren took the ninth graders to their class, where he and the teacher waited for the president to arrive.
Then he showed the kids how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, which, fortunately, is no longer waiting for you, you are no longer free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then passed the puzzle to the first-graders as a gift.

For the last two years, under Alan Záruba, he has participated in the implementation of a complete visual transformation of news events Television Newspapers, Frays, Pásk! and other publicist television shows Nova.
David Fiala controls very well the synergy of communication between editorial, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the path we want to follow in the News News Visual," says creative director Novy Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, the public got nude photos of celebrities
Screenshot with extract of leaked files
So far, an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes both nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, pointing out the American server Mashable.com.
Allegedly, he obtained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users uploaded them via automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the problem.
Part of the celebrities reject the images as falsified, but have already admitted several of the affected image authenticity.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her title role as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played in, for example, Die Hard 4.0.
The hacker's goal is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
The footage was reported to have shown interest in American magazines, according to reports on 4chan server, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it's probably really a weakness in iCloud security.
A tool appeared on GitHub server two days ago, allowing passwords to be obtained from user accounts through gross force, automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool worked demonstrably, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the publication of this tool.
iCloud users should therefore change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password, not its complexity, is important.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
A leak of nude photos by celebrities considers it a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in households or smaller firms, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic photo backup from the phone so that it only takes place on Wi-Fi and after connection to the charger.
So you will have the opportunity to move the sensitive images to safety in time, and you will have the space to delete the failed images, so they will not need to occupy space in the online repository.
We offer instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet to readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
Smart way to save money on college scripts
As the award for college scripts for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the incoming second-year student came in with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system of lending books from senior classmates offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“I won a $180 calculation book for the semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College, Georgia, says.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options to cope with these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes internet shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the semester book often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc operating over 250 bookstores on campus sites says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in response shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Stores in university bookstores.
Here's 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended award for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler's book, is nearly $290, but it can be purchased on the Internet at Chegg.com, a retail specialist in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind other people's notes or wear and tear, the lessons used are the right option.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid 42 cents for the used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".
The new one was sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not important for working in seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold at a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com are also a popular alternative for purchasing used books.
Lending
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need them even after the course.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 for the whole semester.
Meet the terms of the store in which you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get a regular book instead of an e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for some time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, students of literary courses can thus find the best offers because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends that you follow ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order your book online, make sure it's really in stock, advises Gault.
He made sure of it himself.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found rifles from the end of the war in the well.
The well stands just outside St. George's Church.
We unearthed the vegetation around, and we started pulling out an old load - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay day, we hit the barrel," Radomil Novák described.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it was a torzo of an attack German rifle used by SS troops.
The findings are said to be unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," added Novák.
All the wooden construction items have broken down over time, which is why it's useless.
Her body, of course, is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown in by people who needed to get rid of the gun used by SS troops, probably out of fear of being moved.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing guns in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the enthusiasts of the Rainbow Jeseniky Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there once were a lot of them all around here, so we slowed down excavation work, carefully felt the mud so that there would be no disaster, but there was nothing else down there," added Novák.
The discovery will end in the depository of the museum at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltices.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
Exclusive interview Aktuálně.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take this... they call me from Donetsk," he apologized about eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz Ukrainian general Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also director of the local Center for the Liberation of Prisoners.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
At any such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it - go there," concluded one of the flash discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests at Majdan.
Yesterday, when we arranged an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to 24 hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to 30.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed already captured Serbs, Dagests, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not Bohemia yet.
But I do know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captive countryman and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise Czechs to join the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists capture them, they will shoot them without mercy after questioning, just like any other foreigner.
Separatists regard these men as mercenaries' hires, and they claim they deserve nothing but death.
For example, if Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and, among them, even Bohemia - they put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
This guy's just gonna survive.
Even in war, the Ukrainian Party acts as a state.
A.cz: And how many prisoners of Ukraine have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it's over a hundred men long ago.
Long ago, we stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we only freed them... they didn't save them from the war if they decided to keep fighting.
Rescuers are doctors at war, surgeons, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day there's more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about the exchange.
Sometimes a mere human request is enough to release the captives.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority with the pro-Russian separatists and even trust... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls".
I'm not offended.
And maybe that describes the nature of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers' Corps, I've gained some authority before.
I never get smart, cheat, and always keep my word.
No matter what, I'm being honest and telling the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant to the Ukrainian government, or to the Donetsk or Luhana government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even in exchange for prisoners, I've been captured... this job can mean an end to me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know about?
... (long pause) ... both Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners in interrogation.
Unfortunately.
And the executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information about the Ukrainian army's execution of prisoners.
No indication that the Ukrainian army is committing such a thing.
We have an idea of the amount of executions, but I can't give numbers and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They seek independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists are fed up with oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents - to the death.
As we say, they've eaten them to the throat.
The same dreams and desires were expressed on Majdan, by the way.
And now I have a little speculation: Russia supports the separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other to be small.
But there's an irreconcilable contradiction in my sentence.
A.cz: For example, how do you find one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatist Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I'm unarmed and show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I'm always the two sides of the 200 or 300 meters on the fly or in the optical targeting device.
I can always see the faces of the people who are pointed at me... and they can pull the trigger of their guns at any time.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe Ukraine should not exist.
And if it is, it's just like a little gubernia in a big Russian empire.
In any case, they keep talking about it and consider Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the Ukrainian television discussion show, you have called your Prime Minister Arseni Jaceňuk as a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
I get at least five times scared in the 300-foot walk.
Why, then, should I conceal myself with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak Prime Minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think it has a stake in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians are calling Jacenjuk "the king."
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians that would be feared or have respect and authority in others.
His behavior directly replicates rabbit behavior.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he has no right in war to cry in parliament, beg him, play his intrigues with him, threaten to lay down a post... he has to run the country, manage it, and protect it in times of war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest for weepy emotions.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just constantly complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save Sales
The expendable 3 Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the $90 million US budget, and Sin City: A woman I would kill back only $12 million from the $70 million US budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14,6 million during the first weekend, and also films for children like How to Train Dragon 2 were disappointing to cinemas.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in Telegraph, as far as children's films are concerned, their own quality is to blame.
Collin referred to 2014 as the "worst" year of children's films, and called Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films deployed to a slightly older target group, the problem does not necessarily appear to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 cinemas during the period between War Day and July 20 in 2013 and that year.
Results that take into account the opinion of viewers and film critics suggest that this year's film crop is similar in quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewer access and higher popularity of internet servers such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney’s processing of the Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing. ”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already been done.
Unlike the current Hollywood box office blockbuster crisis, Netflix's profit was $1.2 billion thanks to Internet services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted "the collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there may be something about his catastrophic fortunetelling.
With the introduction of possible major box office blockbusters in summer 2015, including the Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimon and Jurassic world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently referred to the decline in sales as simply "cyclic". For Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the summer of the biggest box office blockbusters in history and no one will worry about selling."
The DPRK again threatens Seoul, launches another short-range missile
North Korea launched another short-range missile into the sea, announcing Seoul.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the United States and South Korea joint military maneuvers, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for the invasion.
Changang Province lies in the northwest of the KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Defence, according to DPA, reported that the missiles were fired from a location in the North-East of the DPRK and reached a distance of approximately 200 kilometres.
North Korea thus apparently launched a rocket from the province of Changang for the first time, stating South Korean media with an appeal to military circles.
An underground launch ramp for Scud rockets is said to be located in the province.
It is another of a series of similar trials performed by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea conducted an unusually large number of rocket and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests by opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport took place.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to participate in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as an anti-summite.
Stephen Fairclough pursued the situation during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teen tourists were picked up by plane and transported to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man took a hike to Govetts Leap, Blackheath after Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, anxious relatives called the police around 8:00 p.m.
A search party was sent, including local police and a rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11:00 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit himself in the head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up Monday morning.
In a stabilized condition, they were transported by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the prize was on the foot of yours
The 23-year-old army could have decided, but it failed in two of the best chances.
After the goal, the shot mainly called close-up three minutes before the end, but the site in the net ended on goalkeeper Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," Yours poured ashes on his head.
"I probably should have put it under the lid, it got a little high," he oversold.
The Defensive Sigma did not allow much to Opava, except for Mikul's 11th minute raid, which however covered goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanaks began to push, but in the block defending the home they did not let them in and the shots from a distance were captured by Květnoň.
We were comparing for 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
At the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But he didn't change your expounded chance, so it ended 0-0" sorry coach Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava took the point also due to absences in the lineup, where apart from the couple of injured, Petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík were missing, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike their earlier policies, it did not allow them to enter.
The alternates deserve discharge.
Sigma worked more football, but except for one standard, we did not let her do anything," said Slezán coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression, and combat.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma with a tie got to four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the club boss Josef Lébr, who, after defeating Znojmo, made his million dollar deposit to the box office subject to diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébr's warning, so there can't be a word about the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvod noticed, adding to the address of the sleeping gunman, "I believe it will come and when he scores the goal, it will start to fall.
But after the first hit, I'll replace him to save his goals for the next matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino's excited Venice twice.
The film festival otherwise experiences a crisis
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárrit suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next few days suggested that interest in the 71st edition of the Venice Festival had fallen somewhat short.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because critics recognized Birdman has followed, but for spectators less appealing pictures as a documentary on genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s In view of silence and other social issues films from American 99 homes to Iranian Stories, empty seats remained in cinemas.
The heroes of comic books
Even the red carpet outside the festival palace has not yet besieged such crowds as in the past, and it is said that it has ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute seat at the hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected such esteemed institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but only in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who in 99 homes had successfully performed dramatic roles, for all generations without distinction, the main event became a visit by legendary actor Al Pacino.
He was here in two movies.
In the vision story featured outside the competition, which was filmed by Oscar's Barry Levison according to Philip Roth's novel, he has a 75-year-old Pacino role close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of both career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a strange owner of a hardware store from a rural town in the movie Manglehorn, which was filmed by David Gordon Green, it was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor's Performance should not miss it - but does the artist Pacin's format still need prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, for although he was born in New York City, Al Pacino proudly reports to the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italians
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became after Birdman's first shot rewarded with a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the Mafia is viewed by a view of family relations between clans fighting for each other's power and money, and the director managed to reconcile all prerequisites for a good film: a good screenplay, camera, music and actors.
He also captured the chamber psychothroller The Hungry Hearts, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo and Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost destroys her own child with her wandering anxieties.
On the contrary, French competition films did not receive warm reception, nor did the Redeems for Fame, nor did 3 hearts, both of which adhere to the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, i.e. Birdman and Black Soul, are not so little for the first half of the festival.
And although festival films have mostly depressing themes, a new film by Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy featured in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American fun games of the 1940s, she managed to raise the mood for more than one day.
Policemen caught four meth manufacturers in Prague, they carried drugs from Poland
"Detectives have detained three men aged 42, 42 and 37 in recent days and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold meth drugs in Prague 9 from last November until this August," said police spokesperson Jana Rössler.
First on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit on Cihlářská Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a dose vendor.
The following day, detectives detained another member of the group, based on the prior consent of the state's attorney, a 37-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers caught them in Wednesday morning on 20 August at the Mališická incinerator complex," she described.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drugs
The main organizer had a wide field of influence.
In the workshop of the summer resort, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced meth, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and provided transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He then weighed the manufactured drug, distributed it into plastic bags, and subsequently sold meth.
He was aided by a 25 - year - old, yet unpunished woman, by transporting drugs from Poland or selling drugs to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced," Rössler added.
Criminalists also conducted several home searches on the basis of a judge's orders, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, hoses and other items, which, according to experts, can be considered complete equipment for methamphetamine production.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, police officers found that the main organizer had been sentenced seven times since 1995 for property crimes, the woman was not convicted," the police spokesperson added.
The last detainee was conditionally convicted of sexual abuse in 2006, and a 37-year-old auto mechanic who has been prosecuted at large has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even for him, it was mostly for property crimes.
The Investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other treatment of narcotics and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In three persons, the investigator eventually filed a motion to impose custody, where the judge eventually placed them," said the spokesperson.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as that of the other accused.
Officers continue to work with this man.
Ferrari offers wood and carbon chess.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products for a lot of "interesting" prices.
For example, handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm board will serve as a good example in Italy.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is 43,405 CZK.
The customer acquires a set of wooden black and red painted figurines stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibers.
No one will be surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rising horse at their disposal.
If chess doesn't seem to you as a sufficiently valuable gift, there is also a need for a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course by hand) in scale 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Interrupting grammar schools and high schools doesn't make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that gymnasists have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
It's mostly routine stuff, like transferring pots from the summer storage back to classes and getting chalk.
They're gonna have a little more trouble at the mustard gym.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year gymnasium in Hořice opens and restores its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by entering into the register of schools administered by the Ministry of Education.
"French socialists should shut up and fix France," Francois Holland's key ally says
Valls calls on a heavily fragmented left to "show its support" to a combatant socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet with the approval of most French people.
The President deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, collecting applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite heated conjectures by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister who proposed at the beginning of the week to release the rules.
On Saturday Hollande asked the socialists to remain "cohesive" with the government.
However, Christiane Taubir, Minister of Justice, drew a line across his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for making the French lose faith in the future.
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal dispute between socialists when she stated that she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is too. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last even until the end of the summer.
"And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter," said Le Penová to her supporters.
She repeated her party's call to disband Parliament and stated that she was convinced that it could win the party's early elections and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Holland's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes are taking place in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague's election
Amendments to the relevant decrees should only be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
Other gambling rooms will not disappear from the streets of Prague before municipal elections, and the city will not restrict street art.
Not even dog walking will be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in October elections.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be made by the current city leadership, which ends in a few weeks' mandate," said Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks several city councils, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish the gambling on their territory.
But the gambling rooms won't disappear, the gambling decree won't change yet.
It's the task of the city's new leadership after the election.
Now, technically, we would not even have made it due to, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment of the decree, would take place on 11 September.
A report on a ban on gambling is prepared on the day of the municipal elections of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
Prague 1, who has already sent the city hall a proposal of places that she would like to extend the current list of prohibited places, complains about this.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
An ordinance regulating dog walking the city is preparing for several months, not yet completed.
The location of the sites and the issue of busking is solved by the municipal decree.
Only the representative of the capital may issue them or modify them.
City Halls have only an advisory voice, they cannot issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed victory for Scottish independence supporters at hand.
The Scottish Independence Campaign was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost placed the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich on billboards all over Scotland.
But you can't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor by threatening them.
Morale of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots tend far more to drive money changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, so in a television discussion he repeatedly questioned his opponent, the Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the "superior will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence, and start supporting the single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with the grimace fell into this trap.
Of course Darling won't support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the discussion of Scotland’s currency was more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and defense of state health, which citizens have for free.
Darling supported London's bankers on the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest the privatisation of health care.
By what Salmon said, "he got into bed with the conservatives".
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to voters, but to the association of "boss", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee landlord.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron was able to at least say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's causing him almost physical pain.
What he tells is clear: Scots don't pop up and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic beginning of school according to Miloš Urban
Illustration to the Tale Longest Year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end of the holidays was the best, the last week, which was no longer going anywhere, and we just lay around and babbling with granny summers, silence before the storm, peace before stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading Fast Arrows, the 50th time, the racquetling on a bicycle around the Imperial mountain to the back of the Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun stroked its back and shoulders, tapping the rays of farewell.
In the evening mild nervousness, still holiday mode, sleep at half past eleven, in a week it will be worse, the moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, in the morning rise at half past six.
He's coming Monday.
It usually doesn't rain, on the contrary, summer sneers maliciously in front of the school.
Climbing in the ghostly light to the flat and feeling like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there's that school, ZDŠ A.
Postoký with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys pullier, girls breastier.
There's punks over there to avoid them, it's still interesting how infallibly they stick together and how soon they're here.
And these grown-up girls who came in jinxed, are now laughing hysterically at something, something's probably changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything's the same with me.
And new first-graders, some nervous and others excited, why are they even coming here?
Because they have to, educational military duty.
Then inside, the cool moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, poisoned janitor with mop, unfortunately, still the same one who is supposed to lend the pupil a key from the tin box, where you can leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room remains in memory, now not happening, is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will get worse.
It's just the idea of a stomach spasm that's starting to give me a headache.
The head that can think even worse of math, the evil play for the chosen, which I am not and will never be.
Once again, those threes and fours, God forbid fives, hide from rehearsal, fit in the bench, and best deflate, even not being there, exist only as a classroom name, and dream stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, antennas into space, where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone and doesn't undermine anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only day one, now like years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She's facing exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in the cabin of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without foreign help, she was born a little girl, who after cutting the umbilical cord wrapped in a prepared blanket, hid under her jacket and carried it to the road feeder, where she put it in bushes located several tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school
I guess it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the bathroom on the bus, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors that I wore to school," the defendant described, stating that she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"On the following day, she returned to the place, put the body of the child in her backpack and took it away, removed the body from her backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the staircase at her grandmother's house in Havlíčkov Brod," she says in the lawsuit, stating that it is not entirely obvious when the newborn died.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after delivery, asphyxiation while covering the blankets or when inserted under the jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unbound umbilical cord.
The similar scenario was repeated next spring.
A woman from February to April 12, when a child's corpse was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havlíčkobrodska, gave birth secretly again.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family house.
Without verifying whether she was born alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the child in several plastic wrappers including a plastic bag and left it in the bathroom.
Subsequently, in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, but he allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
For this reason, he is not now on trial, he was only punished for a misdemeanor against the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him not being punished as an accessory.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it felt human at the time," said the indignation of the defendant, who was supposedly subject to and feared him in a man's relationship.
During her statement, the young woman spoke fairly balancedly.
Tears brought tears into her eyes only the moment she spoke of her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching full - time maturity.
She said she didn't want to kill.
"They come to visit me every 14 days, do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't get my gear because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you," she answered the judge's question.
However, she refused to act with reason and intent to kill the newborn.
According to her claim, the second child was also born dead.
Even when she was pregnant, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
However, I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also limited smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed that she was having health problems, that she was watered.
And so is my friend.
The main trial will continue at the Castle Court on Tuesday with the statements of forensic experts.
A verdict could already be delivered on Wednesday.
The woman is threatened by a criminal sentence of up to 18 years in prison, possibly even by exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise approaches the three-billion-dollar buyout of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest cruise ship operator in the world, has advanced in negotiations to purchase Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately three billion dollars.
The store by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company that competes with the greater competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and rich clients.
The agreement can already be published this week, revealed the source on Sunday, but pointed out that negotiations still may not end successfully.
Owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in the Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be appointed because the negotiations were not public.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the comment request, Apollo's spokesperson refused to comment on the situation.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on voyages in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's income in 2013 was $2,57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa, and South America.
In 2013, the company announced revenue of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise segment is expected to profit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public bid at U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the conclusion of a $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when a merger took place with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino companies controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise introduced shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to registration with regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting held a holding of 28 %, Apollo 20%, and TPG Capital LP's private investment company 8%.
According to the registration documentation of the first public offer, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise combined include 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-Democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities the day after the vote
A group of people loyal to Beijing, waving the Chinese flag, stood nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Commission of the National People's Congress approved only two of the three candidates to participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first gain the support of the appointment commission, which is likely to consist of members of loyal Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for the opposition Democrats to get on ballots and force pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and cripple the financial center of Hong Kong by protests of the "Occupation Centre" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tensions, China’s leaders fear that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June to outline China's official authority in Hong Kong, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference at which Prime Minister Li will speak is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office of Affairs of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists have stated that they will assemble in front of the office of the government of Hong Kong this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
According to a description of events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately open negotiations on "state sovereignty" of the torn areas.
His spokesman Dmitri Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the areas of Eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered so that the Russian-speaking area would be given authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian insurgents as equals corresponds to an obvious strategy that has followed since the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novoruska factual independence so that instead of the West it can connect with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were dominated by separatists after Moscow declared the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently called the occupied territory “Novorus” or “New Russia”, a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words that "prison illusion" is everyone who believes peace negotiations are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns before the parliamentary elections on October 26, while government troops attack civilian populations in areas controlled by separatists.
"For the sake of people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of the state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of a broader autonomy, which has been discussed with the leadership of Kiev for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian speaking areas about the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas.
It is not a matter to discuss between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin spokesman, which was to correct Putin's "incorrect interpretation" of Putin's remarks, highlighted Russia's leadership approach to addressing the separatist uprising in the East, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two-million-dollar population are native to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty anectating Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians and polls that took place before the conflict showed widespread support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin effective control of the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the seat of the main Russian naval fleet, maritime commercial background, and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his June 7 inaugural speech, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs considerably from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's last call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals followed by further rebel advance last week after Russian troops and tanks from the previously peaceful area along the Azovsky Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
Separatists reinforced the Russians took control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This has accelerated the huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinates of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of leading representatives of the European Union in Brussels and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive action - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaya after last week two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk area to support besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaysk during the Russian invasion were traded on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the inland of Ukraine, reported on Sunday Lysenko.
Australia's celebrities and Gabi Grecko are involved in the scandal with the photos revealed
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence made it online in the biggest celebrity-hacked photo scandal.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanny, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the leak from iCloud, personal images of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Melbourne actress Grecko were reportedly released.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Grecko to marry him last month, said to Confidential magazine: “It is disgusting. ”
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's a shame personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York City, told news reporters online that hacking is “unsudden” and those who have become its target “feel humiliated.”
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 photos of Palmer with former Scott Speedman's boyfriend, including two shots, on which the topless is laid out by the pool.
Palmer, for example, performed in Love and Honor, where Liam Hemsworth was her counterpart.
Palmer, the star of the television series Chuck Strahovski and the actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said, "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his twitter: “Publicing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
Legally speaking, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Sigmy footballers made up for Lébra, even without winning
Olomouc - Thunders and lightnings, which co-owner of Olomouc's Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinate last week, seem to be the past.
Even though Opava finally brought only a point for a goalless draw.
By putting on and fighting, they made up with the club boss a little bit.
The payout money could come to the club soon.
"I'll keep one more match, as I talked about it last week, but I'm much more optimistic," said Lebre, saying that despite Sigma's failure to win, players convinced him of improved performance.
The combat and deployment with which we played mainly at the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive him for not winning.
If we had played this way since the beginning of the season, I'm convinced we haven't lost yet," thinks Lebr.
Sigma in Opava survived the initial pressure of the domestics, then leveled the game and was already better in the second half.
After winning Kalvod's wards reached out, but their options did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
To complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one transfigured chance," said Lebr, who does not think that the change in the approach of footballers caused only his threat.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the coach's side or the fans' side," said Lebr.
Sigma's got to count on pressure
The players did not want to comment on the events of last week after the match in Opava.
I'm trying to put these things away.
I tried not to admit it," Michal Reichl, a young goalkeeper, turned his head.
Václav Vášček, who did not change Sigmy's biggest opportunity in Saturday's match, left the question about Lébrov's statement from last week.
After all, however, a little bit of pressure has been discussed.
We'll always be under pressure.
Everyone wants to come at us.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride everybody's ass, we'll do it," he said.
The warnings were taken to heart
Even Coach Leoš Kalvoda did not pretend that preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that Mr. Lébro's warning was taken to heart.
Even before, it wasn't about wanting to fight and blowing it off," meant Olomouc's coach.
It was similar to the first fifteen minutes today.
It took time to cope with the toughness and realize what the other league is all about.
It's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
All we have to do is hope that in the next games, that Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I would love to believe that," he added.
