Republican Party Strategy Against Obama’s Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
However, Brennan’s center calls such deception a myth, saying that electoral fraud is less frequent in the US than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
After all, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of U.S. electoral fraud in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states are responsible in the US for organising federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been declaring new laws since 2009, which make the election process difficult or enrollment on the electoral list difficult.
This phenomenon experienced a boom following the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were added.
As a result, 180 bills of law restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted for 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present photo ID and evidence of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit periods for early elections, invalidate the right to sign up on the electorate list on the day of the election, and withdraw the right to vote to citizens with criminal record entry.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state demanded a photo ID on voters.
The first state to implement this request was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indiana law was confirmed in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Republican authorities rushed to extend this process to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have supported proposals for such laws in 34 states in order to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of the age allowed to vote, do not own any photo ID issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have such an ID of about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the purchase of the required identity card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected mainly by young, minority and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% income under $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 therefore do not have the desired photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their attachment to democratic candidates are not entitled in several states to use their photo ID issued by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote for rather Republican candidates to use the cards displayed by these clubs in the election.
Until 2004, no state required a citizenship document for the election.
Arizona introduced the first such request.
As of 2011, around twelve states have passed laws that provide for a voter's obligation to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures seem to aim to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican legislators in 2011 supported laws in eight states that abolish voter registration on election day.
Moreover, they limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign in.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, campaigns to register voters helped to register about 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease in the enrollment of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican legislators then passed laws in the other five states aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans comprised 33% of the voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, the whites, who represented 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the passing of laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
In part, they managed to reduce the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the submission of a photo ID card.
However, the newly introduced rules will make it quite undeniably difficult to exercise voting rights in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the bias of approved laws and consider them to be an obvious effort to influence the 2012 election results in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate corps necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: pass the exam or not?
The PSA test sometimes yielded faulty results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, resulting in unnecessary medical procedures.
All this increased the hesitantness of men who were already so reluctant to go for an examination at all.
Get tested or not?
We've asked two experts for an opinion.
Studies conducted in the USA have shown a high level of contamination between the individual test groups, therefore it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate between patients undergoing the examination and those who did not go to it.
This study also showed after a 12-year interval that those who do not pass the test have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
I therefore recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also a more endangered group.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is exposed.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the level of risk of its type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus on active disease surveillance in such cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not cured because their type of cancer is not aggressive and is not life-threatening.
We suggest that they carry out active supervision and offer treatment in case of disease progression.
We increasingly and more accurately define criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which do not.
Still, I recommend that you pass the exam.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and to determine whether or not an examination is appropriate.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement created an instrument that allows to evaluate for and against the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, it seems the best means to reduce disease risks to adopt healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided if everyone ate healthy and moved sufficiently.
"If everyone quit smoking, this figure would have risen to at least 50%," points out André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer causes inheritance.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even if the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely damaging to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," headlines André Beaulieu.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after the smoker quits smoking, the risk of death to cancer decreases by half.
Weight
Body weight and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease according to SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophageal, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity for life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
That organisation also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
Too high in consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, different scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are inconsistent according to SCC.
Although one of them says there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study refers to an increase in prostate cancer.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu further insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and precedents from the family with his doctor.
"Submitted to the examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100 percent certainty among physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all data is still missing so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, suppose this is the Higgs boson, as the risks of error appear to be small, and let us look at what this is really about.
In this world, there is a completely unquestionable law under which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quant state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
They also divide the physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find proper citizens, or fermions, who obey Pauli’s principle.
And at the other end, there are bosons, evil anarchists, who have no respect for anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing) which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley's laboratories: mesons that we leave here unnoticed, and "force particles" that spread large natural forces and with which Higgs' boss is probably related in some way.
It should be said, however, that these bosons are not as exotic animals as they might be thought.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with unusual banality: photon, or "particle of light", which is the "bearer" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "interrupts" an electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to a pebble thrown into the pond.
This "interruption" will create an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "power carriers".
More stable field
It's also with the Higgs boson, only with the difference that "interrupt" requires another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it is necessary to achieve very high energy values to its excitation, similar to the frozen surface of the pond, which only vibrates a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - the large hadron accelerator with friendly volumes is a circle with a circuit of 27 km! - so that such energy can be developed.
Analogy with an electromagnetic field is useful again to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the fridge.
And yet, with the Higgs field, all particles do not react: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as the photon, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what are all these researches for, what are they going to "bring us"?
In terms of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), allowing physicists to examine any non-compliance between observations and SM forecasts.
Moreover, few physicists literally wish they could be found because the slightest difference could open the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It has to be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, it does not bring any clarification of gravity (dwelling!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the space mass (again ouha!).
However, CERN has not discovered such contradictions until now.
Responses
The responses of these researches in the daily life of Mr and Mrs Novák can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be none.
Look: in the early 1960s alone, laser pioneers in Bell's laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulsed) in 1962, I already said it - laser was initially considered such a "toy to the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, application can also result from all instruments surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle initially did not plan it at all, now serves as an "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that one never really knows...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... ‹ Le Devoir
Through his Commission for the Dignified Dying, Quebek recently became involved in a delicate end-of-life issue.
The debate should continue shortly, while the bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to take a closer look at the issue.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of my life and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The illness performed its work: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just to eat himself.
Resigned, he looks at a deliciously looking breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to unsubs who stop by, bring him medication, offer him a bath.
Courage for a simple death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In all life one learns that men urinate standing up," Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility, tells the story.
Going back to the child stage is unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"Depends on the abilities of the man", says the psychologist, if he accepts the return.
In the opinion of a number of people dealing with palliative care, fundamental moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients entering a home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them do not provide them with so-called "healing" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die of "suffocation in full consciousness".
The illness allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says, and then she allows us to put her breathing apparatus on.
Yet he is still looking forward to his last visit to his son from Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
That's what palliative care looks like when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, a single bed of palliative care falls to 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all gonna die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he can be provided with a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life here.
Last night, they carried Mr. X's beer, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of the late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, days go by, but they don't resemble each other.
In addition to a 32 - year - old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family thoroughly based on pillows while toasting him in his honor, a tragically 36 - year - old man surrounded by his parents, wife, and two young children dies after trying out all the possibilities to survive.
"For six months there are always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer under the age of 45," says Dr Christiane Martel, concerned.
53% of the patients who come to home Victor-Gadbois come here from their homes, 47% then from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering once the sick reach the final stage of their lives, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this crucial inaccessibility of healthcare in Quebec that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide bill.
Since October, the manifesto has been in circulation signed by peaks in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure access for all persons to high-quality palliative care before euthanasia can be carried out.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency room in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
They are afraid that patients should not be asked to be killed because they do not receive appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last few moments, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted stopping fighting, telling us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their treating physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of palliative cunts eased their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care in the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal area, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, physicians often use palliative sedatives that will put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by impact or whether the sedative is administered permanently.
We cannot pretend to ignore this part of suffering.
A patient we can't get rid of the pain will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
Sick people who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to provide me with euthanasia", it means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
A grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research enabled this report to be implemented.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are blended.
This "labor" came very expensive to the Quebec taxpayers especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has crumbled since we took major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal, ironically.
Thanks to him, a scandal broke out in 2011 on the basis of a rigorous investigation aimed at embezzlement of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which were approved by the then liberalquebek Prime Minister Jean Charest only after long delays.
"Duchesneau report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption by state officials.
"Already since the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "the Department of Transport has only saved a billion dollars on orders," when some people have kept their instincts in check to gain a stake in them!
Charbonneau's commission "has already led to the resignation of two mayors," he adds with the hope that she will be able to "discover the subtlety of some people".
Permanent unit to fight corruption founded in 2011
A permanent unit to combat corruption founded in 2011 also engages in the fight with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the officers of the "Marteau Company", who since 2009 have made sure that the Montreal "money pipeline card" significantly mitigates the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a number of searches and accused of fraud and corruption of a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a village from the suburbs.
The next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been received by traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
Lino Zambia triggered a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
He himself dedicated 3% of the value of the orders he received in Montréal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambia was generous to all parties after 2000 and dedicated over 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euro) to provincial parties, but in particular to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice Prime Minister Nathalie Normanddeau.
Contracts with money pipelines whose prices were higher
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very vigorously.
Gilles Surfrenant, a former transport engineer, described him very closely before the commission: within ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, hockey matches, and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money pipelines, where he overestimated the prize.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had been paid rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through untrue multi-work.
The mayor's party organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of turning a blind eye to the parallel budget that brought dirty money to his cash register.
Based on these revelations Tremblay resigned early in November, thus throwing Montréal into an extensive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Priries district in the east of the island, she has been arguing against the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says that he "takes the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system soaked by an ants to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
According to her, the process is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montréal and to ensure that these questionable practices cannot go back.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have alienated hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "deputies informed of this trick", unless they are involved in these scams!
It estimates that 70% of the funding for election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony adds, "I hear it's just a weak deterrence of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to the parties to $100, but he believes that this will not solve the situation: "Until the electoral spending is strictly limited, the dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public procurement and party financing: "We can't go down any lower; if we boldly focus on the essence of things, we can build again on firmer foundations and with greater control and compliance."
If this story has blackened the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who mocks him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or by a completely new dimension of the PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day, I get further next to them.
The tech team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier in games.
Everything goes so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in preparation in INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I always moved on to individual degrees.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
Reinforcements from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makele, who used to play the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have the right word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he has no equal in the 1st League and is among the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you view the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took our front position.
But we're staying behind.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: very easily we progressed to the eight-finals.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a heavy opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group before Porto first so we can play in a rematch of the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget's already up for it...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
That's not the case today.
On the financial side, the PSG has the resources to make this project happen.
And would it be a big failure not to win the 1st League as last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We've been missing a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had the guts to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think we're gonna make it this year.
Although large teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, are also seeking the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us given what's been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat the Troys 4:0 at home and there's still something in the paper that we're being blamed for, it's not very pleasant.
You ask what more people want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 on every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
We proved in the Champions League that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who has not fought in the eight-finals for the second season, yet they have invested large sums!
Given the investments, you could expect to have 15 points ahead of the others!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French League.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which failed very well last season, moved on to the next phase with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the First League is.
I hope we can smile in May and say that despite all the hardships, we have succeeded in winning.
PSG seems to rely on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's performance in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's a "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovich is very powerful and that he gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's a league star.
Everywhere he passed, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both man and player.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has accomplished is truly extraordinary.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with French representation?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I've been through it, and I've come out stronger.
Today I also manage to play good matches in the representation.
And that's what I've been hoping for since my entry into representation.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We're in a good place to qualify for MS.
Coach picks hard, he's close to the players and he can get excited for winning.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a struggle in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable however to dollars, euro...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today moving to the limit of about $10 (the course overview is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's not impressive.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its virtual finance report, which was published in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "competitive dollar and euro" and "a period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being like "credits" used to advance in a video game, which one can win by playing or buy (and sometimes swap back).
Facebook Social Network also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all network nodes are depositories of current accounts books, controllers, money issuers and buyers as well as sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the validity of the transaction.
Furthermore, thanks to the file content, it is possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of current accounts that is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is a phase of file cutting; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers will "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they will "cut apart".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructibly displayed connected to a string of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If the user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each one has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by 21 million, but they can be divided up to 100 millionths, so there is room for margin...
The difficulty of the assigned task is also increased with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has experienced its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used loophole does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a company for payments with real money that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Notable players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like a WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and demonstrated that almost 80% of bitcoins do not run.
In November, "large discounts" were launched.
"$30,000 has been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul dealing with the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless cell phone payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set for traders where new terminals or software are not necessary.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and identified" by the phone, specifies Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is general movement to question hierarchical systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin succeeds, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB foresees a reassessment of the various risks considered to be increased today if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what else?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside, which we punished, suffered the greatest harm because we considered them terrorists.
And so did we, after all, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often are peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of the French troops from the foundation of Nijrab, which I followed from the mountain peaks planted with almonds thanks to French loans, took place orderly.
Truck convoys and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked for aerial escort helicopters.
As of late 2014, Talibans will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered to be of its kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, which was completely dominated by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation did not improve until our time.
Former mujahedins, Afghan government and current Taliban agree in an effort to preserve women in a subordinate position.
Major dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state land, which they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people want a government that won't be made by thieves.
A number of young people want to leave just as those who have been able to use American generosity will leave: the leak of capital is considerable.
The young are tired of war and the ideologies associated with it.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world and took advantage of it.
About 65% of the population is under 25; 5 million people currently live in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
There are public schools full of cities, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to be given work, they do not want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes cell phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that take her lead be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization in the pattern of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister that existed since the constitution was adopted in 1964 was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam works, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
The priority is a private initiative.
Government infrastructure control would be necessary in a country destroyed by three decades of wars.
Rumors have been spread that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And it just made the feeling that the western states were only here to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without means of transporting raw materials through the mountains, however, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine and left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area to retain the role of the most important employer throughout the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys lycea, departments of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for an archaeological delegation.
As of 2009, the "get your heart and soul" initiative, attempting to reconcile aid and military activities, was operated by the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but achieved numerous achievements in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural restoration in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a few French NGOs.
These work, involving a number of local workers, helped dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of the cultivated area.
What memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, often located at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural assistance from local communities in Cape Rica.
In order to free themselves from the uprisings led by foreign groups, these farmers wish, as they say, to achieve a slight civil aid in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly touched.
Difficult Work at the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Morsi embarked on another poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the proclamation of the constitution, which temporarily confers on it unlimited powers, it decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else's opinion, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been added many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal conjectures.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's diversity.
From the opposition's point of view, the President remains in his 'autocratical delirium', continuing to 'violate his word' and 'stepping the law'.
However, its supporters assure that it is a means of turning the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transitional process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of clarifying the article to the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the entire country is being swept away by protests.
As confirmed in an interview for American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced the Egyptians would vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people ahead of the ultimatum: 'You either approve my text or I keep unlimited powers', which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new constitution.
And in this particular atmosphere yesterday, 85 Members of the said Constitutional Assembly approved the text with a large majority of Islamists.
Most liberals were absent in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was announced, they slammed the door saying they didn't have a chance to assert their views.
Human rights advocates, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their move.
In order to achieve a quorum, 11 alternates were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to consider that one of the few disputes revolved around that day... prayer hours when some committee members held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly adjusted.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately identical to the 1971 version of the constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term 'principles' with the term 'rules', allowing for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"The Hypocrisy", the liberals object, who see it only as a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role on the University of al-Azhar, in particular on issues of compliance checks with Sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "persons authorized to express are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can be seen as the beginnings of theocracy".
The fears of liberals are further fueled by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"For now, no particular religious consequence has been manifested.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but university workers, many of whom have graduated in French schools," temperate concern Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a job on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
They agree, however, that "there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because in it the terms used belong to the religious dictionary.
There is particularly a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, note red.].
And there may be a question in the future to what extent civil judges are competent to comment on it".
Yesterday's approved text is, in addition to religious sites, highly criticized because of the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been significant restrictions on them compared to the former regime.
Another disputed place: powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of military representatives, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, in military courts, proceedings with civilians will not be banned, as the Human Rights Association demanded.
These associations speak of their doubts in connection with the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The act of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, stressing Heba Morayef of the Human Rights Watch organization.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the President of Egypt was scheduled to appear in a television speech last night, manifestos are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel there are waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, belly of the world and sea from saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the integrity of nature.
AaF identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
To bow to holy places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God's mercy will descend on all those who enter this "bath."
And Galilee - instead of Jesus' wonders: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming down the storm, and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus revealed himself to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here pass through the Path of Pain, or Jesus ’ Cross Way (in Latin for Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fort of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment took place, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's Grave on Mount Golgota - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian belly of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most sacred place for Jews - the wall of lamentations, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different religions leave their wish notes, which will then come true.
Make a Journey Through the Vertical
The ruin of Masada's fortress remained from a secret shelter from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The ruin is located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who engage in mountaineering can reach it by their own forces.
The others will take a cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the foot of the hill.
The total length of mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived at the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth visiting.
In his exposition, his canvases are widely represented by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha museum-bath, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of spa users and spa attendants from that time.
In Caesarea is worth visiting the unique private museum Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - The Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and you find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are glittering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea can also be bathed in winter months, as the water temperature in it does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe throughout the year.
By the way, the Dead Sea is the most strange sea in the world, located at the lowest mainland point of the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily maintains on both the surface and the people who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to heal your nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous maritime route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they shared a long and happy life.
Indeed, tourists love strays with narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press yourself against the walls in the alley of your "sign", happiness will favor you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors including Pilate Pontius.
The carefully renovated theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population speaks.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now $1 is approximately 3.8 shekels).
There are mainly buses by city transport, but in Jerusalem there is a express tram, and in Haifa there is only one metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
It's basically an underground ropeway.
Traveling all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can move for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, he ceases to work in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning's work week.
In many cafés, restaurants, and hotels you will only get kosher meals: except pork, seafood, fish without scales and meals containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various kinds of sauces, ground chickpea balls - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel.
But there are very many fatted cats who "wander in their own taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The forward cats love the populous places and with a taste they go into every goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day by car brand.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And rent a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by numbers
More than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
To get to know the country and relax came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited from January to October 2012 at 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Big and powerful" announces it to Moscow: emigrants save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, frauds have already appeared in the country selling 'counterfeit' certificates
13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and other Russian cities each year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law came into effect, according to which each working migrant would be required to pass an examination of Russian language knowledge.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the sectors of services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that, over time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the trials will consist not only of language skills, but also from Russian history and from the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also have to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
This law is not even subject to people who have successfully achieved certification and obtained an academic diploma by the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, convictions and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin's Institute of Russian Language, University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass exams in all cities; already more than 160 such centres are open in Russia.
Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services) also supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask many times in the press the question: and what will it really bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration service - are responding - it will allow the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labour."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains FMS Chairman of the Board of Directors of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only the organised recruitment system will allow 90% of foreign workers' problems to be solved.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, without education who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people, who under the pretext of helping him secure a "proof" to terrible, tight dormitories in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will spend months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland they promise them one thing, but on arrival they will cheat them, impound their passports, fail to pay their promised wages," says MS Tolib Šaripov, head of the Tajik Labour Migration Administration.
Don't swear!
The less that many citizens of Central Asian republics intending to work in Russia recognise that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as rather misfortune: very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to obtain at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be decently dressed, dressed, and equipped for school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the law on language testing, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants with legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even take the exams or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally in Russia as before.
"Welcome, or Unauthorised Access"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police employees know that we have basically fake documents, no registration, and that leads to blackmail cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Chuškadamov, shared his experience with journalists.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of validity of the language law, it was found that the false were not only the documents of migrants on registration.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the language exam.
The forged documents are printed on a plain color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to facilitate the problem of passing tests, paid 7,000 rubles for this document.
That is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
Thus, the main task of the immediate future is to secure the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply purchase documents, in which both government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time the necessary time to take a course in the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not know Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
The MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia submits a proposal to tighten the law in relation to civil arms owners.
It is the government's response to recent events: the trigger was the shootings at weddings without casualties, and the massacre prepared by Moscow attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a license for carrying weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption Irina Jarovaja, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem through "screw tightening".
An open letter appeared in the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "unsensical tightening-up" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, declared by Vasilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the BBC's Russian editorial.
According to statistics by the Ministry of Interior, 142 offences from the use of firearms registered by the Ministry of Interior authorities were committed in six months 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening civil arms legislation will not force the perpetrator to switch to the "black" market.
According to their words, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "Black" Arms Market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept arms orders
The first of them - "army or military journey", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The guns were also stolen by Russian officers and the caucasians themselves," Baranec says.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals in security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement authorities in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" get sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It is proven that some fires were set up intentionally - to cover up the manka," the former soldier says.
According to Barance, they also bring their contribution to arms manufacturers.
"There are currently private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market, and they eliminate the weapons they deliver on the black market, including Moscow," says this expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are made in small-scale production, and a mafia formed that organized their smooth production," ex-military explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists discussed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, reported by researchers, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons found themselves on the black market "by the guilt of officials whose work is associated with weapons," says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons from armed conflicts come from, 14% of the cases of gun theft in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms stores who asked us not to mention his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archeologists" no longer purchased - are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers drive for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the ensign, they buy a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, and he sells it to you through the fence.
"He will carry her into town and sell her there for 900 euros apiece with two trays," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever a plan begins to burn in the clarification of crimes, they will conduct a check purchase with illegal arms dealers," the advisor adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The sellers with the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I was visiting websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Test" platform where there would be a man who would lead me to the "way" where we would act together.
I learned the prize in the first place.
Military rapporteur Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, tells a salesman- an advisor.- I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him fully.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that my daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I can get there through the person I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he processed the state to publish the subject.
The schematics did not change according to his words.
They gave him an album with photographs that said "everything you thought of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baranec, is not offered a rabbit in a sack - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller into the woods and build a target.
"They'll give me the chance to shoot, and if I make sure the gun shoots well, we're starting to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Container on the sofa
The search engine will bring you to the web site and to the "In Contact" groups where it is offered to purchase a gun "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a set amount of money," they say in the advertising headline on the website "Buy a combat gun or automatic".
Users leave their announcements on this website and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the original is preserved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
Recently, the Federal Security Service has thrown away an enormous network of planted websites, and persons wishing to buy a military weapon may be raking a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish on bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military dignitary Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make an ATM payment.
"In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions where the gun is hidden," says the NGO's press secretary, "Right to Gun" Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website you can stay unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Macarov for $100
When you purchase an illegal firearm, you usually pay from $100 to $900, according to expert estimates.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "Right to Gun" you'll get a Makarov gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for a month and a half months.
The weapon is dispatched from warehouses to long-term storage through warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of such offences in Russia decreased by 7% compared to January - October 2011, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of gun theft and extortion, ammunition, explosives, and explosive devices cleared up by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers strike
Working at the box office of "McDonald" will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and popular fast food chains such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken" have risen in America.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to perish soon.
The entire share is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries received by regular workers in Walmart and in fast food systems, protest organizers aim to achieve their creation in their trade union organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, seized millions of inhabitants and in some cases was accompanied by fighting.
On this day, some Walmart workers, in which 2.2 million people work worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational companies of business chains whose goods are intended for people from lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage employees in Walmart stores buy only at their work.
The availability and range of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply because he pays little of his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded a raise in salaries and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the company increased sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker receives $ 9.5 per hour, but this does not correspond to the cost level, says the employees.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the increase in wages fully to consumers' shoulders, every visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend approximately $12.39 more than today.
Walmart's advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should not cause virtually any damage to the company.
The "Black Friday" at the company's stores lasted from 8:00 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Overall, her cash registers performed nearly 100 million transactions on "black Friday".
Representative Dan Fogelman stated in an interview for the left-wing Huffington Post website that jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all about "an additional media sensation" organized by the union.
"Unoccupied box office!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's stores (those in that progressive city are not very popular, and therefore are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and New York State regulations is $7.25 an hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wage, but only slightly, and on average their lineage workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
By employing "McDonald", nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and live with their parents will go through.
Few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
I am currently constantly meeting in an interview with the "McDonald" workers who complain that they must live on this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, Wall Street Journal hangs a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast food businesses start receiving at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
American laws prohibit the administration from preventing the establishment of union organizations and punishing union movement activists by bullying and dismissing them.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, it is also difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food businesses for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the abnormally high staff fluctuation.
Disagreement
On this day, noisy protests were also held in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the event was at the noon rally near "McDonalda" near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians performed, especially the Jumaane Williams City Council member, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The protesters also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must speak together to support fast food workers in order to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the greatest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although far from all of them were fast food workers who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event becomes a spark that ignites the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain manages to deceive mediocrely"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology is a popular theme of widespread reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google performed a work model of this news, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent application.
An interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi shows that glasses are already a thing of the past for scientists of this company.
It attracts them the perspective of handling virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us, in terms of context, what is your research group dealing with?
We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensor - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is available for sale today without Kinect sensors because it is a very interesting option for all to drive using gestures.
- What else do we have in the future?
- Apart from the fact that Kinect has transferred interaction to a physical level, very many interactions are still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been separately.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
You need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, for this purpose it is necessary to know not only the users but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimated?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - a question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control the facilities in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not squishy, just such slops, short ones.
The gesture would not be taken with a camera of the device, but with a bracelet to monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far it's large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
How do you ask me, for example, to give you this can of soda?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's going to be very difficult to tell.
- So you're trying to get users to adapt to what a machine can or can't at the moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These may, for example, be laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you are to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
At the present point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z axes.
So the velocity is also very important, the number of frames per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with current, serially produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects a person's interaction with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, but I just don't need that much touch, but I need some extra frames per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras isn't necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with the curvature of the camera location and see how this will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I recall correctly, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) did not publicly present his glasses.
Don't you think that when it comes to everyday use of enhanced reality technology with special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a "portable" form of an extension of reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphones at any time, projection screen and around.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, that is their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time weakness - widespread reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that handling virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say widespread reality - that's the seventh consecutive breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think complementing tactile perceptions could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the other hand as a particular kind of base for displaying.
In an excellent way, he records the compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactileness to these "images in the air" - such as interference of several directional ultrasound rays at the defined point where the finger is located, causing a touch sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on your fingers.
There is also a wristband that affects nerve endings in the fingers - also promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick your brains?
To think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something at the moment?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to get a person who is physically located in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a target, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in complete beginnings.
Vkusov language instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradian avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, are avant-garde culture and art.
At the top of the list were already notable figures of the art scene of Saint Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, at the fashion pubs and at the openings.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're displayed, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of purely social and philosophical petrohrad storytellers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is a conspicuous man of the Saint Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of citizens, he increases everyone's mood.
He recently took the bottle into his hand and became a St. Petersburg Flashinetarian because he had matured into this complex role with his whole Bohemian life, philosophy, and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town all red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that differs a little bit from gray is arousing aggression and arousing bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to debate.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
That's when a wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I couldn't understand new, free types of artists.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonevs, who brought us to the "Pushkin 10", and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theater, to dress, to music, to all genres except the word.
- And all of this was in your art clinic...- It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best powers of creativity should gather.
In 1995, I took a seat at Pushkin 10, and there existed a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of the Bohemian bohemian.
There were born many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Šnura was brought with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang under the plywood of light songs, dressed in tight leotards, in the middle of them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachténberg, so began his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and permanent guests left.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture still meant something.
In 2000 a survey was arranged was in print, the special prize was "People in our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was named, finishing my peak.
In new times according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are today different things, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and penetratingness are captured live.
I'm going to have a program show called the Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, it's painful and terrible to be like this today.
But in clowns, everything gets wiped off, tragedy is taken.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of a totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today, people meet by clothing, focusing on external mechanics, not internal man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We saw you the other day in the role of city flanter. - Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who would be if I didn't?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
At present, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
People used to meet in groups, the bohema loved one simple other people.
Today everything broke down on a micro-company, today it's very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to wonder who you're gonna like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand viewers will come to Stasu Mikhailov!
- He's gonna get hit by fans, where the sexual social sphere engages.
And 300 people come to cultural land, and 10,000 people don't come, and the result is less management, less money, everything's wasting away.
I've got fans, the main thing is, nobody fools them and breaks what's going on.
When I was young, I painted pictures of one collector hanging on the wall along with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse terms.
They say:Culture of the spiritual, culture of the consumer.
There's no consumer culture, that's from somewhere else.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejecting money for drawing paintings.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's the shortage in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a term: an actor through culture.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
During the time of the proper Tsars it was not in everything, the Tsars may not have understood the culture very well, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St Petersburg who might be experts, but they are tucked in a corner somewhere, because they need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and bring them on the right track.
Today, tasteful language thrives.
The same Erarta, but differs by honestly saying that we accept not all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- Saint Petersburg - it's not the capital of culture, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And on our eel, art thrives poorly.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers than readers in our country today, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to shows, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion thing, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St.Petersburg grant
To be born in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with Earthmen on board are on their way, searching for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: how do you keep your family in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted even hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Sternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, however, on the surface of Venus they reach a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius.
It's only possible to live there at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The questions of reproduction in space began to be addressed by scientists with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were made on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was carried out in orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to verify how the embryo develops in a weightless state.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird at the exit.
But then trouble begins.
"There is a problem that this bird must find support, must stand on its own feet and begin to move," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they do not find the support, the birds fall chaoticly and make the crumpets.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds had a complete extinction of their instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"We hatched birds twice, but then we turned it down because it's just impossible to work with them there," comments on the failure of the chicken experiment in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite, "Bion" will only be beings of one sex.
An experiment has been conducted with rats that have already been sent into space pregnant.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, a progeny was born to space rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
When animals lose their usual environment, they simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens rules by abstract thinking and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tereshkovs.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Tchaika has flown away, and no one on Earth could tell if they could make it to space.
Whether she can deliver a baby after a flight like this.
"But no one has yet answered that question," says Vachtang Vasnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into space, the first female-cosmonaut Valentina Těreškovová gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Saviická was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts born and raised healthy offspring after long years.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," states the cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Poljakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection, and artificial gravity creation.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here in zero-attraction conditions, astronauts acquire the habits needed to work in open space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although water is a comfortable environment for adults, in a strange way, it is a natural element for young children.
Little ichtianders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the child being in the mother’s amniotic water for an average of 9 months and making it easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical because only 2 weeks pass from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath.
"That's very little to make the baby forget anything," says the swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if there is a more natural condition for a newborn child, then for women, there is more natural inevitable gravity, an attractive force.
In a weightless state, the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles, decreases the body's ability to expel the fetus very quickly.
We can leave that aside if the muscle activity stimulators work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth takes place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What else?" asks Valery Polyakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by earthly attraction, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He'll just be deprived of what he needs for his development unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that admits the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," the head of the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Bioethics Commission predicts.
So giving birth to children in space today is just a theoretical question.
However, one day there will come a time when they will become reality and when the earthlings will set out in their ships on a faraway planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the SAO: Control of the bottling system failed by politicians
The Czech Republic has good auditors and quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but it is limping in its application.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what I think is missing from us," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, he lists Peter Nečas' approach to the so-called "sharp system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneur with his controls - is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be set up in some way, and if it forbids something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of an office that has the duty to control and enforce duties," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the public procurement legislation in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates how to deal with public contracts, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all of this together, and although the control is not yet completed, we have found very interesting differences - in general speaking, the legislation is perhaps "more stringent and perfect" in our country, however, the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is confirmed, therefore, that it is not enough to make more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to pursue the application of the law itself.
In fact, what can this project do for you, what can it do for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop making efforts to refine laws, reduce and improve limits when this does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the appropriate thing for reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal acts.
But by lowering the limit on contracts, we do not necessarily have to achieve that.
Maybe the system will be overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will be able to draw more easily from it than if the limit had remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with transferring legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office here similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As for the authorities, just as the SAO works there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similar to us, also has a collegiate, just forms in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed similarly.
Also, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a Federal structure, it also has these accounting courts at the level of the individual Länder - this makes the system a little different from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state resources.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities in our country, are controlled there from the level of the Federal Accounting Courts.
As far as the legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a pattern, but it cannot be said that it is better at everything.
Is it necessary, then, that they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it has to be said that even the countries we consider to be role models face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any good for them to work with our office, would it?
With regard to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are its effects already showing up?
Since the validity of this amendment is relatively short, we do not yet show up in control events.
Since we're doing ex post checks, there's a certain delay to be taken into account.
We are only observing this in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new tool "risk detection of inefficiency", through which we have driven almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - that is where the changes will, of course, manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
Do you therefore consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
A problem that may arise here that the rules "stiff" and cannot be followed.
Already under the previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is the law worth tightening in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't go.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneur by inspecting the so-called 'sharp system' - and what does that mean?
Is the shoe system forbidden or allowed?
After all, the law must be set, and if it forbids something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of an office that has the duty to control and enforce duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and we'll allow it," but he can't say we'll act like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are rather strict rules on what is to be formally done - which is correct to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the bidder with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what I think is missing from us.
The roads are frozen, but usually mobile.
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, roadways are mobile, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region, roads were rolling this morning, but sometimes frozen and also snowy.
Temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is to warm slightly during the day.
Snowfall in the region has ceased and in the lowlands lies only a weak layer.
On the ridges of the Erzgebirge, however, there is about 30 centimetres of snow.
The places were also lower visibility due to fog, resulting from data dispatch of regional roadmen.
The R6 speed road and first-class roads are now mobile in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridge areas where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also mobile.
On them, however, there are still remains of frozen and snow in some sections.
Especially in higher positions, caution should be paid to driving.
Pardubicky and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a threat of frost, in higher positions and on the mountains there may be a travelling layer of snow on roads, informing on its website the Road and Highway Directorate.
Roadmen warn the driver of the frost, it can be formed mainly in higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Police, Svitav or Vysoké Mýt, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The high snow layer is in the highest places on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia it is mostly clear to half clear today without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Plzensky Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are mobile this morning, but some times with caution and the ride needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, temperatures range between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication may be frozen.
The seats must be reckoned with by the driver with fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is based on information from the dispatch of the county roadmen.
The D5 motorway is almost accessible without limit, but caution is advised by communication administrators between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a surface dry and frozen.
But there may be frosted sections in southern Pilsen and Tachovska.
Communication of the second and third classes are damp and also in this case the frosted sections are alerted.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequented trips in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Today, drivers heading for the highest positions of the Olomouc Region must count on snow mash on the road.
After the chemical sprinkle, it remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl Cross.
The roadmen were driven into the field at night by snow; they snowed about three centimetres in Šumpersk according to the road managers.
In the other parts of the county, the roads are mostly mobile without restrictions.
"In Šumpersku lies the remnants of snow in the highest positions.
With snow mash on the Red Mountain saddle, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník," CTK said today.
In the evening, their colleagues went out to Jesenicka, the roads up to the highest positions are now, according to them, after chemical treatment bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are accessible without restrictions, however, in Sternbersk drivers should be careful in forest sections where the road remains damp.
Ústí Region, Liberec Region
A few difficult rolling places are reported by roadmen in the north of Bohemia this morning.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice to Ústeck is closed, it follows from the police database.
Temperatures are also held in lower positions below zero, so the ice and snow will probably last on the roads.In lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operating complications are not reported yet.
The incidence of icebergs is reported by roadmen especially from the surroundings of Szczecin.
According to meteorologists, the weather conditions were ideal for her at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night clear and frost.
Unfavorable conditions are also reported from the main moves on the I/13 road on the boundary of the Ústí and Liberec Region.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice forced bent branches of trees that bent to the ground under the snow.
Simon Ornest: At the concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarms we people like to catch on to.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a statewide fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
Three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava on the day before 20 December from 21:00.
They will end around the time of the Mayan calendar on Kiribati Island in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we worked everything out together with our artist, Honza Augusta.
In addition to gathering enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we, along with the public, also want to think about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World Cancelled".
She is already very popular on YouTube, will she also sing at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in the end, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It is sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The hymns will suddenly connect in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, sings in it also Xindl X...
How did you get to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, as we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out most of them are interested and entertained in working with us.
What's the end-of-the-world benefit?
The equipment of the wheelchair education centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in Jedličkov Institute.
The students of Jedlicek Institute regularly run out of teachers and are engaged in activities that entertain and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go as lecturers themselves, so we try to enable them to do so.
As part of the completion of the Jedlicek Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you pick them out?
We tried to build a program that would reach out to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic events" for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York City, and I personally, while we are in the US, would like to combine it with the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you handle these paths logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric cart, her carts have to travel in the luggage compartment, then, of course, we carry with us a large amount of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, that I was surprised many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, that was no problem.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differs in barrier-freeness, public access to handicapped people and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have just seen in Russia that everything in the east is still in complete beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric cart to move alone in the city center.
They don't even pay for the obvious, like you prefer wheelchairs in an elevator.
Fortunately, civil associations are already being established there, which is trying to alert people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improvements and improvements to the situation are always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In both London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with heavy disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in which the Tap Tap and I are a little ahead!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will things start to change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I joined Jedlicek Institute as a tutor, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play, among other things, a saxophone, so along with my colleague, I set up an interest music club.
And over time, as our presenter Láďa Angelovich says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we began to connect with famous singers and also to actively work on the promotion of the band.
We figured a job that couldn't be seen was basically like it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is crowded with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in its own way, all new is received carefully and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique are very few, but I dare say Tap Tap are one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it's natural...
But the pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the resources to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for society.
Did that success also help that you are a strict boss, as many people have identified you?
When we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic imagination and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to take two weeks of rehearsals, go to the preparation and spend a lot of time travelling to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to do something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, there's no stopping it.
He who has the will and taste, always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21:00
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Gasojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities connect at the end of the evening with the telemost during the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier education centre STUDEO at Jedličkov Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free admission tickets at pre-sale Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week at the meeting of the ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on November 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
However, Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had taken flight to space before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I will recall the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which featured ideas from his pioneering work Entry to Space.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listener cold and after years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Sternfeld in 1934 won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha Prize for the Entry into Space in France.
Recalled Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonautics and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the averted side of the Moon was named by his name.
As early as 1925, a railway dresser was built in Poland, which was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and there are no details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used for the running of the drezina or for its braking.
Information about this drezín is only known from the period press.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to tackle missile missiles.
Research was provided by Komorka Techniki Ubrozenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is evident from surviving materials that research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, by the arrival of German troops, research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work of Rakiet - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza autor Leliwa-Krzywoblocký came out.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects of military use of missile technology were devoted to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all work was coordinated.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity his activities ended the start of the war.
Other works dedicated to cosmonautics appear after the Polish press war thanks to the work of the Polish astronaut society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a mention of the company in the November edition of the 1954 edition of Problemy magazine, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society that will deal with cosmonautics.
At the time, projects of artificial satellites were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has sought to join the International Astronaut Federation (founded 1951) and already in the autumn, PTA became a full member.
And in the following year, the first PTA chairman Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice chairman of the International astronaut Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of a very successful weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to undertake scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of a two-stage RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should have been able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
Following the first RM-type rockets, the Meteor-1 rocket developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differed in size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, a space of 0.4 litres, a 0.34 litre Meteor-1B, and a 0.62 litre Meteor-1C were available.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight trials began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is still important to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a live debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic formations, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to considerable differences in labour prices, price tensions occur.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer seeks to compete with the import of cheap goods by "undercut" the price of the competitor in order to bring down more market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either transferring production abroad or buying cheaply or dying there.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for unemployment produced by it, the state’s social spending is necessarily increasing.
The whole situation is enhanced by the total reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby to compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create in individual economies a situation where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments place private capital at the risk of their own population regardless of the social downturn.
This is reflected primarily in changes to the applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to adopt a price dictation of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and by limiting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
There have been public food outlets in the SRN for many years for the poor, who cannot feed on their own work.
The number of these people has gone into millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for duly employed people to receive such wages that the state must pay them to the existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people are forced, under the pressure of a disastrous social downturn, to either emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on hunger wages at the periphery of society in the hope that private investment capital may eventually come into the country.
But here it is necessary to ask where will it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African are still working for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media suggest that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly insists on the position that the State must not interfere with the economy through management interventions.
Then it must be asked whether private capital affects, now actually manages politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here's the definite answer, isn't it?
The evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is criminal, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is that the state ministries, for lack of funding, are awarding draft laws to private legal firms, which are heavily associated with industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not from the people as declared by Western-type constitutions, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation as described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in Caesar and Pompey:" The state has long been in complete decay and the authorities have been occupying themselves with violence.
For bribes, illegal favors, and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant without any inhibitions, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice" ..."Characterary people did not seek office at all, so once as a result of this disruption he was becoming eight months without consuls". "The only cure in an evil situation was self-government and that it was necessary to elect an energetic man." Appianos thought of Pompey, but became Caesar, who changed to perpetuate democracy into self-government.
Conclusion As in antiquity, the current society is based on a reckless preference for its own benefit regardless of the whole social interest.
By its very nature, private capital is no longer able to understand and apply social benefits.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any attempt to reform the deeper nature.
We must therefore seek the causality of the onset of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present situation, the demise of these systems in favour of liberal-type democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of the next round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites completely ignore in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from competition at both international and internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reform, which will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes from violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions emerged.
One stands behind Israel, arguing its right to self-defense, and Palestinians fall into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, they argue the racism of the Israeli state, genocide perpetrated on Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fits into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically recurring waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including self-government territories, were born into the current political situation, and the beginning of violence was not experienced.
It is my intention to offer readers a view behind the curtain, a view of who the 95-year tensions have served (calculated since Balfour's declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle East country.
Some of my considerations are supported by the available historical facts some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of a power struggle.
In every epoch, we can track down some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities who have been completely autonomously directing their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who has directed their actions to a predisposed goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one who could consider herself the head of an octopus (if anyone is still standing over them I do not know, but I do not rule it out) - Rothschilds.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
They bought the first press agency (Reuters) as early as the 1890s to stop combining their name with highly criminal acts in whose background they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the increase in wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all of the central banks of the world and against countries where central bank shares do not have or prepare wars (before Afghanistan's attack it was 7 countries, after Iraq's attack it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subjugated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Central Bank status of Rothschild's Bank of America, began issuing his own (understanding government) money during the Civil War, and was murdered in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, was assassinated 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for unleashing the major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by the mason of Albert Pike's highest, 33rd degree consecration.
The first war had the task of removing large monarchist state units in Europe, the second was intended to remove the colonial estate in particular of Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere to 0.5 – 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a precipice for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method used by a group of richest families headed by Rothschieldy is to induce crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the founding of the Fed, so as not to repeat the crisis as the one they triggered in 1907).
So after they succeeded in murdering the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to start World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by triggering the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (no longer needed a war to destroy the Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the Central European Power, Austria, Uherska, was fragmented.
To facilitate the start of World War II, bankers left politicians to create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating a prerequisite for radicalization of impoverished masses and then they just had to slip the Germans a strong enough, guilty and simple solution offering the Leader and further by creating a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also playing, the function of the fifth column, when the war fire was started.
In the late 19th century, Rothschild initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out if Hitler broke out of the chain on which he was initially held, or everything he did was planned is hard to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created a prerequisite for accepting the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like Germany's war reparations, the outbreak of war 3 was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish nation, like the other one, will be a victim in the first line of fighting, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let us take just how sharply the people divide on supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are only pushing their own candidates to choose in elections.
Israel's current Prime Minister Netanyahu hawk is a typical example of a fascism, to international bankers loyal, a politician who does everything he can to start a war with Iran, which, due to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to grow into a global conflict and to control Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, by which 20% of all world oil travels (the navigation corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appears the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a completely controlled being.
"And they force all the small and the great, the rich, the poor, and the free, and the slaves, to have on their right hand or on their forehead a brand, that they may not buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of her name.
This must be understood: Who has the reason to add up the numbers of the beast?
That number marks a man, and it's a number of six hundred and sixty-six."
Film Argo: When the Worst Is, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, he occupied a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohamed Réz Páhlaví, who fled to the US after the revolution, which had been patronizing his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would thus fundamentally jeopardise confidence in allies in other countries.
However, the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of an attempt to liberate hostages by force.
Prisoners diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The debate in Iran greatly contributed to the loss of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that brought America a tiny victory.
Just before the embassy was cast, six employees fled it.
After complex peripetias, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In cooperation with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran, while helping with an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who was inspecting locations in the country for filming science fiction large films.
Genre Combination
The plan devised by the "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez also required Hollywood cooperation.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time called "caper movie", a story of a successful piece, a backstabbing - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
The film thus alternates moods - on the one hand documentaryly conceived sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightweight passages from Hollywood, arranged with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had a remarkable way of rebooting his career.
He became a respected director from a mocked actor, and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film not played in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the director's older films promoted above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the opening sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which simultaneously conveys the emotion of confusion and incontrovertibility that occurs when history moves out of nowhere.
Affleck and his coworkers achieve a similar effect in stage fiction (false staff at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
Quite successfully working with it, sometimes he thinks something of reality - there everything doesn't go so elegantly there anymore (a scene in which an impending crisis at Tehran airport turns off a phone call in America and the runway chase seems far too far-fetched).
However, the weakness of the Arga is the dissipation resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Although Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, their characters deserve more space and are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film kind of loses its dramatic move, it's a film that can be watched with mild interest, appreciating the realization and retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
It's hard to pull off.
As a reminder of one living history so far, as well as evidence of how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and knowledgeable secret services are, but it will suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which announces an annual poll for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led to this last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the lead of major European companies," said Patrik Nacher, a legal poll organizer.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent European Court decision to unify the premium rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured at life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky to insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include, for example, mandatory incorporation of bio-components into fuels, which, as a result of the damage to nature, is also a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of hen cages, which has made eggs significantly expensive this year.
Criticism had also previously faced a factual ban on the use of the term spread butter or the elimination of classic bulbs from sale.
High quality bananas should have 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under pressure from one or the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic is now promoting the demands of its banks as well as the threat of veto).
The lobby's interests were also based on the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not to show "anomalous curvature".
In doing so, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising the existing non-uniform national standards that have complicated trade.
Despite opposition from some states, the EU has already softened the fruit and vegetable standards by pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation may also be a candidate for winning the poll, according to which the sold inflatable balloons must be required to warn that children under the age of 8 must not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed to American research that balloons among toys are the leading cause of children's death to suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 when blowing into fairies.
Curious ideas are born at home
There is also a fairly absurd rule regarding European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must speak instead of it about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, the Bank Fees.com nominated for the poll in addition to some of the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU set maximum levels of food stocks that could have been located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, established volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The poll organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies at the request of obtaining a subsidy.
These ideas, however, did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, was to stand full warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic’s continued access to ports.
Finally, the European Commission came out to meet the Czech Republic by organising a tender to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development managed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically intended to go to the filing of a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are an exception
While the regulation is easily targeted by criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and to more effectively operate and develop the whole Union are, according to a number of experts, more worthy of recognition.
The more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, drawing EU subsidies on projects that have no indication of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by the Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The emotion among Czechs is that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, and it will not always succeed in this match.
Czechs, after a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians, retained the designation of Olomouc shapes, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century with us, had to be renamed a tuzemák by our producers.
Only cane distillate products, not sugar beet, cane cane cane cane cane cane cane name.
In the official list of registered EU products, the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma hams have already found themselves, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, burnt and Třeboň carp and žatek hops.
Pardubic gingerbread and mustard tubes can also be proud of the EU trademark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked without a problem in our country, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the last 20 years of the country steal, as thieves run, people's taxes and retirement age increase.
I shouldn't have been an ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Aren't you turning your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying this whole time that I'm going to go to the fight for the Castle as a result in the Senate election.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool for how I can realize my visions.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate possible.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we curse in pubs and television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Media that dehones a person and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie will add to that.
For example, I was claimed to bribe journalists or to have been a counselor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You went into the fight for the Castle with the theory of material and criminal liability of politicians and back-to-back property returns over twenty million.
You have to change the law to do that.
But as president, you do not have such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
As a citizen, when I lobbied to make the guide business a free business, I managed to get it through.
The problem is politicalism - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, he deliberately rejects it, and that delays citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party labeling and dogmat I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing person or a left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people place me more to the left.
It's not important to me if it's a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone's left or right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose the bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But you don't prove it by what you said?
When you make a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Some may call it populism, but all the suggestions I am talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by major experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have the passwords left.
And you can't keep up with that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists, and the public and trying to get them on our side to push it through.
If I were elected president, there is no problem in organizing a television live broadcast where I ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they'd have to tell us why they didn't want it.
If there is a strong personality who will name vices, pressure can be placed on the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, that was due to the public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find an ally.
I have only just started in politics, and I will try to get majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things myself if I can't, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, which is why I've been going around a number of known people to see if they'd run for the Senate as well.
I went to see Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenc, who has been covering up light fuel oil fraud.
I ran for the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm on the fence.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and those who went mostly chose representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have chosen the Senate so that it will be difficult to push for change.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or captains.
Are you considering starting your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to check every potential party's clean past, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only $20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have land for about 25 million, a ten million apartment, another eight million apartment, a collection of works of art for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant with women and also fought against bad things and bad things.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million worth of property, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign.
I'm supposed to be in debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program may not be that interested.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign out of my own.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover what I'm going to get from the senator's salary.
But I couldn't make a living from it, for example, I couldn't pay my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you could dampen these activities?
But it has nothing to do with the salary.
As promised, I have partially subdued my activities.
For example, my representative will become a travel agent in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I need something to live on, too.
As a businessman, how much were you used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I'd quit my business.
You can find the whole interview in the Saturday issue of Law.
The architects of MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not just happening in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"I find the building cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally, something interesting is again to see," says Lisette Verhaig, who is passing by on the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
However, I ask why we still need a library today.
They all have Internet, iPads and electronic books.
No one goes to any of these old-style libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not even worth visiting, holds a special record.
This municipality, with 80,000 inhabitants, shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not overwhelming.
And so the city councillors knew that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rutterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of madly bold column charts and contractor of witty, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm and at a competition meeting in 2003 appeared with five books under his arm and smirk on his face.
And while the commission looked around astoundingly and shrugged its shoulders, the cheeky Maas threw his presents at himself by size and ended his activistly justified speech with the words "Dear Township!"
So this is my proposal for the Mount of Books in Spiikenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a €30 million mountain was added.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
Moreover, the project is nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Small-town grey, which so far could not offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an extremely ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of its existence.
Long Road to the Book
First impression: a reader's eldorado under the cheese hatch.
The middle of the mountain massif is a lift, but the real spatial and readerly passions can only be discovered during walking topography.
From all sides, the glassed interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burned-up convertible and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally stands shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space that is mostly incoherent and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down, and we pushed the reader's space from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is well used: on Wednesday there are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and home technology switchboard.
A special delight is the black shelf for books that are one wall paneling, one parapet and another by railing stairs.
Appearance, structure, and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and construction engineers shake their heads over unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, on the question of Standard magazine.
So one day in a Friar farm, we came across an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimetre fleece of synthetic matter has been used as a base under the roots.
It's cheap and time efficient.
Thin textiles last one, two seasons and then mature to be dumped into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantities - was pressed onto plates of four centimetres thick.
By causing heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns dark, homogeneous and weight-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
You can reach the top by 105 stairs.
At the end of almost 500 meters long wandering, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly the right humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite many glass surfaces, is a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It heats up and cools the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden ligaments, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shade and capture much of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
He can handle the rest of the fully automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, an initial sceptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as "a long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every resident of the city was invited to an opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
Thus, the optical gaps in the currently not fully equipped library, which currently includes 70,000 pieces, were to be filled first.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, everyone now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This succeeded the MVRDV in the royal discipline, which in the professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting in the decision on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Stephen Szabo's Europe, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled at the beginning of the week that it would vote against the motion for Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libya uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a no-fly zone.
NATO eventually pushed it through.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy in the direction of the US-led policy, so to speak, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just settling in, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as they have in France or the UK.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean in German terms?
It shows the readiness to take national interests as well as positions that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, namely export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
Firstly, Germany has a large outlet in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to scare the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to put too much of a point into it, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany’s relations with the US damaged when Germany abstained from voting in the case of both important decisions, such as in the Palestinian vote?
I think there is a great understanding of the German attitude in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not think that this was as dramatic a turning point as on the issue of Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even earn some respect.
This indicates that it must be regarded as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
In contrast, the US made it clear for veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think that the Obama government may have a considerable secretly understanding of the European position.
But, as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, be held publicly.
I don't think the differences in opinion are at all as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very happy about Netanyahu's policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans to have a coherent and united European policy, which is currently not happening.
Therefore, they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a prominent international player? Does it even want to take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a larger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany adopts a larger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all kinds of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The US's influence in European politics is now constantly decreasing, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Mark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What is Armani Polo?
This hides a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection until they are sued by actual brand owners.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will achieve the law.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
Forgers just need a few extra letters to sign their tags.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they will have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the Puma sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a binder with records of a stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there. An artificial name that parasites even at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
Chinese world masters are known to be in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several storeys in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
Pattloch's cases are different, however, and under the authority of his mandants, he opposes Chinese firms receiving from the stamp office the right to use a label that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
It means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging business, we have to fight it," Pattloch calls.
"The mark dilutes, exclusive status disappears, image damage is enormous".
The financial losses and judicial costs of the affected industries go into millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, is the third largest market in luxury goods and the market that grows fastest.
However, the deletion of dubious records in the register of brands is difficult to achieve and it costs something.
Driving can extend to up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases when the court dismissed the lawsuits because the claimed name became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a law of the jungle.
Known cases include graphic items.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the Sana construction machine manufacturer, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer pumps for the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO’s stamp office admits that there were shortcomings there in 2010 due to too little staff and space.
But last year, it was reported that "the process of work returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed objections proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
Yet there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China has been running a list of new applications around the world for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
1.8 billion Yuan were selected for fees in 2011.
This simply means that each login costs an average of 1280 Yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs several times to start a dispute against this, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitation car parts has been cancelled.
However, the forger still secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget this ourselves because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office then also rejected the objection of the Munich firm.
In the other two instances Freudenberg was able to obtain law, but the opponent still struggles in the dispute.
You need to be very careful.
The matter is now being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company archive, they even had to look at a hundred-year-old file to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the counterparty a "high six-digit amount in euro" in vain to settle the dispute.
"From this you can see what it means to us", says Wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will also affect Europe.
And that's in case the impersonators secure unprotected markings there.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register the Freudenberg brand for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business was given up by the group long ago, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You need to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both Pattloch and his attorney advise German businesses to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international grade rights. Rather, foreigners should "anything worth protecting in any way, register in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be a lot more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of his drama, then he will probably have to pay royalties for his own name to the counterparty, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed off the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is trying - and in Swaziland, orphans are happy about it after parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that transcends much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there's the stomping: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's moccasins look for tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are pressed, mom and each other are prosecuted.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it up from his textile shoes when he joins voices with his slow-wild gestures.
It's Monday night, at the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology, the Imbongi Choir is trying a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years old, from a researcher in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy track, each chorus voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesothu, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
Unaids, a United Nations AIDS-fighting program, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of which, $23.5 million live in the south of Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, the village of Esitjeni found a association of Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second-degree school.
A patronage may be taken over for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one warm meal a day at Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "narrator of stories" or "he who praises" in the language of zulu.
In this space, no one can speak in this space, only sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes it brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometres (8,733 km) from Heidelberg, there is a village of Esitjeni in the northeast of Swaziland, which is dependent on the size of the German congregation’s voices.
Forty percent is infected
Around 2,000 people live there, some still living in plain clay or straw huts, a large part of which are children.
More than 300 of them are no longer parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni you can see in a small, what makes the entire Swaziland sick: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry a virus of weakened immunity within themselves. It is not rare that they die at less than 30 years old.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completed school education, they have no chance in a poor country at all.
At first, it was a private deployment of individuals who, for a few euros a year, allowed a child to be sent to school and given him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later, a congregation of "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Mugs and scabs are part of the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch's Institute assumes that at least four of the five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases often occur are chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is spread relatively little among heterosexual adults in our country, but roughly 20 percent of newly infected people fall within this group.
Among juveniles, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomaviruses often occur among teenagers.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to the Institute of Robert Koch, the number of infected syphilis was more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of newly infected HIV patients has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms point to a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genitals, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
The danger of infection can reduce condoms, but it does not offer 100% protection.
For the origins of sexually transmitted diseases can be partly passed on to infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent rotation of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPIs and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations, and, last but not least, the royalties that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjen," says the president of Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a confident woman who is able to assert herself.
He also makes sure that orphaned children find shelter, such as in one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the language of zulu is called to old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and they make sure that the children show up every day in uniforms for school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school, built two hens, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had an HIV test.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," Annette Lennartz says, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his implacable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state approved way of life is responsible for the spread of HIV so rapidly in recent decades.
But so are many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To support cultural exchange at least a little bit, the Imbongi congregation travels once every two, three years together in the south of Africa and sings songs full of grief, combat, confidence in the future and confidence of the blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the speech of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also shed tears with many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is the crow flies from here, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there's ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as follows from three studies published on Thursday by the specialist magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shadow.
It is reported to be at least 30 centimetres and perhaps even 20 meters thick.
This water apparently came from comets or perhaps even asteroids that crashed into Mercury.
But let us not put the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said the leader of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, findings could help us to explain how water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, undetected earthlings, participate in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images are sent to the Earth, small windows into endless distances.
The film comes from a photographic apparatus developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new term definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This cut from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the pink-coloured "novores" in the star's delivery room are less identifiable.
This area where stars form - scientists unromantically call it W5 - discovered the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6500 light years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The muffin ring consists of material that the star ejected during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid nebula, which is 5400 light years away from Earth, a new star is created from gas and dust.
A photograph of the Galactic "Cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The cluster of Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters", is seen at night by the naked eye.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors are better suited.
The Helix nebula may look like a red eye to the observer on this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the earthly continent resulted in this nebula naming North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is a cause of extraordinary discoloration.
This "minimum" among the stars was able to dream in full beauty up to the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they originated is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble Telescope: the Vortex Galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
The footage published by the European Southern Observatory depicts a few thousand light years away from the Trifid nebula in the constellation Rifle.
The name Trifid derives from the Latin word "triffidus" (divided into three parts, three klanný), for the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar birthplace into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonoš, astronomers photographed a sign of cosmic rainfall: at a distance of 400 million light years from the Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are being driven to each other and a collision must inevitably occur.
This birth of the star was recorded by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can call it the nickname of South Windmill.
Photographs from Hubble's space telescope show a carving of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cefea.
This 1,400 light years distant nebula consists of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a black hole ring that is 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by Hubble's Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810 scientists.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of the stars gives rise to new additions.
Also, these star clouds, associated with Rosette Nebula, are still giving birth to new young stars, 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe it was only formed shortly after the Big Bang when there was predominantly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
It was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, a year later before Galileo, he used it to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are becoming deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, America, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 metres.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its average is about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of a cheap way of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Portoriko), scientists in space are searching for alien signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who puts his computing performance at his disposal.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Very Large Telescope is standing here, honoring his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to have a full 42 metres and is to be composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Kecko telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which besides them looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescope.
Also on Mauna Kea is to develop a new giant telescope - with a 30 meter diameter mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
The most significant impressions from space, however, are conveyed by Hubble's space telescope.
The footage of distant worlds has been provided to us since 24 April 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
The picture shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
James Webb's Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board the Ariane5 rocket first in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6,5 metres in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that there is ice even at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent out in 2004, and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many live to see the Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Finding clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many live to see the Bible age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Finding clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
We can call the ride of the Talyš Mountains wildly romantic.
The microbus rumbles along the road with many corners along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and plain farmhouses.
Everything's green and juicy, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
But this is the extremity of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh lives, which is not known much about, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This small town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not suit the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
Eight hours is required for 323 kilometres, as the road is only single-lane.
The fairytale wealth for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik is capable of becoming a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prize in May - and we will have the oldest festival in the world next year," Fatulajeva says.
She's the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a documented life of nearly eight dozen Tales from around here who are over 100 years old. Fatulajeva shows black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still fathered a child.
However, the disputed star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep Şirali Müslümov, who was reportedly 168 years old.
Of course, the birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest man with papers was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulajeva explains.
This man was reported to have been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he was said to have fathered a daughter.
So, was Şirali Müslümov wrong at his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of elderly people in Central Asia.
"Despite many elderly people live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley, Pakistan," Scholz says, "also in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men."
However, no scientific evidence of age can be provided due to the lack of evidence, especially when the registers are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik often live to the Bible’s age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why, then, do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
On the contrary, the director of Fatuljev Museum believes that it consists of nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem to be entirely credible from the bromotological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzaev.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzayev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasian region.
He sits on the ground with a butterscotch that he cuddles tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayev and a daughter. Both are long ago grandparents.
There's two little kids jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for guests, which is served in typical belly glasses of "armad".
The white teeth of Mirzayev form a perfect line and hide a long dark blonde copy under the scarf, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look and kept my color.
"I never used shampoo either," Mirzajeva says.
A Monthly Retirement Enough to Live
All she ever ate was what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I've never bought groceries in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything got better when the oar was taken over by "loved father" Geydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds weird out of an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is being made around the figure of the father of the nations who ruled his country as dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan do not suffer from hardship.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is a sum that can be enjoyed well here.
And maybe even Mirzayev's long-grey son is right: "Old people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If it's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is missing in the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The demolished demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep disparity.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is being debated sharply.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but primarily to Christian Coptics, Liberals, Enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, yet hopelessly wrangled in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's State" of the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost apologized that he temporarily limited the constitutional court's powers and extended hiss to "save the revolution".
However, what a 61 - year - old engineer who has a doctor’s degree at the University of South California really wants to save is not clear to the Egyptians or the world.
Is the judiciary to be stripped of power?
234 paragraphs, which the Hundred-headed Constitutional Assembly, with the predominance of Islamists, has quickly approved in the fifteen-hour night marathon, are partly arousing concern.
As in earlier constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this unclear formulation and associated legal spare space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least this sheds light on the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in a country with great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
This may not be, but it may mean that the clerus will be overseeing the legislature, which would bring the judiciary a de facto withdrawal of its rightfulness.
There is much interpretation in the draft constitution
The problem is also that civil jurisdiction of military courts is to continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's reign to suppress the opposition.
After the dictatorship fell, as many as 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As it stands in the proposal, the state should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is legally formulated so inaccurately that by means of this paragraph state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In clear language, this means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality between men and women.
Yet another paragraph forbids the reproach or slander of the prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
However, it remains unclear what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally dubious that the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited.
In this case, is a cartoon of the President or a joke enough on the account of the law experts?
The matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Morsi submits for signature and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular voting.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks, opposition has been forming against the outnumbered Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered at Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night in unusual congruency and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to apply.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who placed third in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej stated that the draft constitution belonged "on the junkyard of history".
Through the service of short news Twitter accused the adherent Morsi of wanting to perform a "puč against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said a member of the opposition Jaser Said.
"We are not tired yet, our brothers' blood is not yet punished," quoted Egyptian media opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, thus becoming invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood declared defunct, but out of caution not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
She was attended by many veiled women and salafists who cried out, "People demand the application of God's law."
They challenged Morsi: "Clean the earth!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, on which it all began, would probably trigger a state similar to the civil war.
Obviously, Morsi's supporters didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country is going.
The majority is considered certain in favor of the Islamists' proposal.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
The enforced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, aggravates Hafiz Abu Sa'du.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial for Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution now the words 'human rights' are not once," he complains in an interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
Morsi's extension of power to all three power forces in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Place for the president to strengthen civil society, effectively cancel it," Sa'da complains.
But democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which watches the match of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
The protester at Tahrir Square warns, "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk: The most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's secret of success be linked to a local appetite for an extremely stinking fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
This will give you the smell paralyzing the smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's largest delicacies.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and there is a ubiquitous smell hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians begin to meet here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, as best to say, the most captivating meal.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General" who is responsible for the festival's course.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard says.
Drinks can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there was still no refrigerator, fish soaked in airtight barrels with water and salt in autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses no doubt became numb with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, with mostly emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings, and a large care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, who was much richer recently than Norway, flows into the country for work.
The rakfisk is viewed as something important, indispensable, although a rather reeking part of the Norwegian past.
They are among the more expensive dishes in the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you £9 (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway does not often get into global reports - and it seems to suit most of the population.
The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called "the July 22 event".
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind the current wealth of Norway lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as you say, considerate people.
Her English, like the English of most of the people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway is treating its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial crash threw away the money they did not have, the Norwegians had strings tight on their purse.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough rakfisk.
I'm sure a moose burger like that is something else, and it's beautiful juicy.
But tonight, the stinking fish is back here.
The hotel I live in is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to live television broadcast, in which the presenter is surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls out of the chair, possibly damaged by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces, and at the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenge.
Mexico did well economically at the time of Felipe Calderon's resignation, but the country is in the clutches of a drug war that had already estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a huge commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office early this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to enable us to achieve this.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. President, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions on the new leader are different even in its old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural city of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the leaky and bumpy roads that had been here before.
Plates with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with climate change issues.
"We expect it to bring real and permanent change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state MP for the Party of President Pen Nieto, Party of the institutionalized revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in security and economy that our country so urgently needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Olver's MP admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pines presidential palace, much is expected within the party from Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And he rejects the statement of opposition characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward man, very concerned with the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nevahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Za, cannot be contrasted with paved streets of Valle del Bravo more obvious.
tucked under highway overpasses in many ways, it resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the Autonomous Community are also persistent and urban.
In the early part of this year, the military was called up to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially intense violence against women.
In the last two years alone, bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in deserted places next to a vast waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pena Nieto say that he failed to deal with the problem of murdering women in his office.
And in worse cases, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a derelict neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photographs of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body was washed," Buendia recalls.
It was marked with blows, and the postmortem rigor has already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is a single word: "Justice".
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, troublemaker, and whineer.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep your mouth shut.
"But it can't be right when so many mistakes and omissions have occurred," he says.
The Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority for the duration of his tenure in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor," says MP PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the victims' families in Ciudad do not fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is attempting to refute Bradley Manning's claims regarding rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds of the gross treatment of Manning in prison.
Private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor tries to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, has missed many options to complain about the rough treatment he has allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutors have Ashden Fein in cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had had with the unit's officers over the course of nine months of ties at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of maltreatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during the hearing held on the defense's proposal to dismiss the case against Manning on grounds of gross treatment at a time of detention, which in itself is a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
Army Intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, U.S. Attorney Fein, along with Manning, passed the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico Prison, where he was held in a high security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and considered the overall treatment in the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of maltreatment, although Manning's officers directly asked about how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he expressed concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about treating her person in January 2011 in meeting with a commission assessing suicidal ideas he had expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the regime of "prevention of injury".
The military stated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance due to suicide) for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before being transported to a detention prison at the Naval Infantry Base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and one day he passed out because of heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very depressing.
"My world has shrunk only to the base of Arifdjan, to that cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that upon arriving in Quantico he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, gimmicks, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against regulations during the day.
Manning stated that he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint regarding the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was reassigned to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manninga also asked about the charges he made on Thursday's statement regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night naked in her cell at Quantico, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates in the morning counting.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket when he counted.
In a Friday interrogation conducted by Judge Manning, Manning stated that by order of his guards, he concluded that he had a blanket that he could cover himself, but admitted that no one had issued an order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that you were not dangerous.
Manning stated that he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his gimmicks to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his gimmicks and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience of his imprisonment and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, she will greatly reduce his sentence.
The defense has stated that it plans to plead guilty to Manning's minor crimes and that it will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, a military prosecutor is expected to advocate detention terms as justified.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations regarding all arrested held in custody with maximum security.
Charges brought against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security, and the theft of public property or records.
If he's charged on all counts, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely broke through the crowd and arrived in the area for the immigrant agenda, where I encountered a problem.
The darts pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("For Foreigners").
I stood there for seconds, and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic acronym, just like when my friends in Boston are called "Iry," and my friends in New York are calling themselves "Italians."
So later I ended up labeling "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican president of Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama's White House this week.
On the agenda, they had the usual issues to discuss when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are going to travel to the United States.
It wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under threat of arms to re-write half of Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think within centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after a United States representative says something just a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite of complaints about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's children will take the warpath.
And yet Mexico’s real challenge is its relationship to over 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparents who had been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origins from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And while we live the American dream now, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and view us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left him.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Even though she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have any roots in either.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and present Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and press political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
Fair enough.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for their dealings with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel dissent for the way in which their family members were treated in a much closer past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such occurrence is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary conjectures about who started it, many buildings were turned into ruins, killed by over 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, missiles from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing everywhere around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
It may cause their struggle to be even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there are currently not many reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire concluded on 21 November persisted, this week's fighting strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most dire and populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, currently governed by its engrossed rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can well conclude that time is on their side.
The Islamists around the Arab world gained more influence, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, the resurrected regional power that once was Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering people of Hamas say that the Islamic crescent surrounds Israel, north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah Party/Military rules, across Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclined to Islamism can depose Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt changed, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hardline supporters reach opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli missile system Iron dome proved its worth, and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries also blamed Hamas on the start of the last round of violence.
More importantly, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, there was a relatively calmness in Israel from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be the Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined with an even more radical group led by Avvigdor Lieberman at the start of the election campaign held on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, they wouldn't launch missiles like their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them if they stick their heads out.
The hardline supporters may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than all its four Arab neighbors combined.
Opening a new war with the local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments heal their economies.
President Morsi working with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may mean the beginning of something new.
Israelis too should look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying the rights of Palestinians to self-determinate a gunpowder barrel that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Even now, repression weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population grows.
Blood attacks against Gaza taking place every few years to push Hamas will increasingly collect diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides say, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states where Israel moves the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping fire will provide pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, along with Turkey and Qatar, must work to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, has a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside must also push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has his share of getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected the introduction of his own peace plan.
Now, back at the White House, he seems equally reluctant in his entry into the trial.
That's woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette packs entered into force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, display warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australia's laws on ugly tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, entered into force, and the logos and colours of brands replaced general olive green boxes with hideous images of sick parts of the body and depicting children and newborns ill due to their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures required from Saturday, the only difference between boxes of brand names that are printed in the same small font.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding them of their attraction.
They rely on studies that show that if people do not start smoking until the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," says Federal Health Secretary Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been hard lobbying against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will lead to serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarettes to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals regarding laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold nearly 6,000 pieces to wholesale retailers and expected new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
Across a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and demanding that most vendors hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising conducted by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is an insurmountable place to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Mrs Freeman has seen an increase in ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, implemented by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and went to the trouble of creating this video, or is the marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it will handle new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic for the attack of new regulations - a country within the World Trade Organization declares that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of Australia's countries is doing significant business.
The SOO decision is expected to be passed in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government conducted talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to over 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are considered by Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and stick the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that thanks to uniform boxes, it is harder for him to balance them into shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, we'll close the store'," he said, and he threw his hands away.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I've had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and child development experts increasingly come up with praise for boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
Should we then encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a fairly new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History says at the University of Calgary, Canada, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History of Boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompey, a Latin inscription regarding boredom was found, dating from the first century AD.
And then the question is how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada.
After viewing research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was unable to".
Boring differs from apathy by not being involved in anything, but wanting to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything about apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "disturbing the process of attention, coupled with a bad mood and a sense of slow passing time."
Boring can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a mutual relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape that person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program silently reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, the distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "such as finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and doodle, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to wriggle will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom sometimes - a delay in my flight, a loud speaker, a particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals have a better chance of being bored than others.
To help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed a "Strategie for Proneness Scale" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all.".
Using these scales scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodonovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally indifferent.
In 1991 Reed Larson, a professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers reported that they were bored at school and doing their homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored when they were away from school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentage of boring would now, 21 years later, be higher or lower.
However, he said that he knew that "adolescence is the peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boring for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodenovich, who studied the problem for over two decades.
"Nuda is a way of the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch television, it will only please you for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of constant strangling of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to be bored even more, but boring is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly restimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when noise shuts down."
There's no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and footballer from Southeast Colorado, faces charges of crimes for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for possession of several grams of marijuana and pipe he used for her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he drove with some friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in a car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and drug use equipment - minor offences for which there is $100 for each fine - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But he's a criminal?
In uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on legalising a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends more on the spot than on the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offences have already been lifted here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have stated that they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and still accuse people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains vote to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is going so fast that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Even regulators in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all until 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, whether for good or for bad, is ahead of most states in regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now also recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State alcohol licensing board.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can follow," he said.
The Washington Act, the so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession will.
And there are intricate mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state directive on "corresponding access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trafficking up to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"It will never be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Hemp, a recently established research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates of Aurora sent his officers an e-mail informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each citizen over 21 years of age and that police "with immediate effect" would stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, they face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, although many of them face other charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer blames adults for possession of a small amount.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado’s voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed deep divisions among local officials in view of this great state green experiment.
For district attorneys it is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendants for possession of marijuana, and a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Law Reform on marijuana.
"They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to build on a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best track to become national test cases for legalizing drugs.
Defense attorneys and state authorities plan new boundaries for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to regard marijuana sales and cultivation as federal crimes.
The defense attorneys of marijuana legalization hope to submit to the Department of Justice.
Despite several arrests by marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients using it, who attracted attention, the federal government mostly left the medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and other 16 states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to break down the door to capture a small drug bag, it is likely that they will resist allowing state-controlled recreational marijuana stores permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy advisor to President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the advance of the federal authorities.
Prior to the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana business, although it will take about a year to open any trade.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we issue a license and then we get a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, City Council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the municipality voted for, versus what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Today's university students are not the only ones attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest headquarters of knowledge, a modern wined Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, I packed my bags in two weeks after joining Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, and crashed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard diary claimed I gave up because I objected to the lovemaking of students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said in a whimsily that I had left because I was forced to drink from battered cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You might ask why I'm bringing this up now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students on the right of Wednesday suffer similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the younger-age association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are shown not to be welcome".
They demand to establish a position in the university Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation was also not helped by the recently stated BBC Two documentary show entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Fairland: Young, Intelligent and Right) about student political events that the Conservatives portrayed as weirdos and neo-Nazis.
The show featured a graduate of Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University - OUCA), who rode Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a cane with a silver head.
At other colleges conservative students say that they are treated as "sacrifice lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Nottingham University), told Sunday newspapers that "leftist influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unpleasant", while 19-year-old elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that there has been a deterioration in the access of JCR members to the people on the right from Wednesday.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to members' welfare," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority about one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18, and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most ferocious.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse the honorary title of former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in higher education funding.
Even Stalinists would tremble at the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students associate with each other and with professors, I received a taste of the wormwood that was to come.
I found that not only do professors quietly approve of taunting conservative pupils, but they also enjoy attending it.
A mining strike, privatization, and opposition policy of the government against apartheid sanctions in South Africa was brought into the wooded auditoriums.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the 18th century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty tough.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very gallous.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I've gone back to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
He was a sophomore student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me now, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I tried cowardly to pretend.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who (what irony) went to Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students didn't tell him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love?" asked one.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the Liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour man and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years have evolved before me as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of those writing her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
This place hated for his provinciality and pettyness and for his tendency to Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took the position of professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting from Oxford to my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said, pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes are gloomy.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week during the course of teaching, when another professor of history in absolute seriousness stated that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed inside, I confessed that "parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
Relief was short-lived.
My father nailed the nail to the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper each week.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes, my stalkers gave up.
After they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snotty wimp.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and venom in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but who to this day also hide behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion creation" launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Nate Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting Valentino Garavani's exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt enthralled by a rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, overflows with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most prominent nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Vogher in north Italy to the idol of the international "bohemian elite".
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"They are at least a tiny tip of cigarettes into a great carpet, as some wonderful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests entertained abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to glory.
And he's still a star."
Valeria Mazzová performs Valentino
The designer's charisma is not forgotten by Argentina's model Valeria Mazzová.
"It has been many years since we went to his house for dinner after one show in Piazza di Spagna, Rome.
There were 20 of us, and there were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every tiny thing of his apartment, decoration, food, music, he reflected in everything and felt his spirit.
He made all invited people feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who began working with him during the 1995 Paris Week of High Fashion.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Nobility Parade
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but a truly re-loved love.
He loves people with good manners and better degrees and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was rebuilt into a distinctive 70-metre-long arcade offering role-change: a visitor turns into a model and marches through the arcade to observe the " generality" of dreams, wearing Valentin's masterpieces as a dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica Vitti wore in "Night", or a coat of wool and fur belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience mannequin shines names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norwegian, Rosario Bulgarian or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "can't be forgotten".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the fall-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Nate Abascal, one of the designer muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity and great love for women because he underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, make a lot of light and give 'spark' to his face.
The proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget how she first dressed Valentino.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she longed to be of age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
In the end, she was in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first Valentino dress to celebrate at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with callows, a stacked live and a top with no hangers.
It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains Italian aristocrat whose life revolves between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has deposited designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories they have in them".
"The King" of Fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Pavel Greek in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different laces and a train length of four and a half metres were needed four months of work and 25 "holes" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents the landmark of the late 20th century top fashion, "the return of high society clients".
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoire-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honors in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated by the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulates as much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always been drawn to his finesse, calmness, groomed and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was brilliant, time left no trace of him."
If the princess says so...
Toughest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, carriers in the area of Indonesian volcanoes gamble with their life and health as they withstand 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by conquering sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, it has to flail every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gases escape from the inside of the Earth and when in contact with the air, it goes into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, it carries them on its shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
The peak of the volcano, which rises 2,386 metres, is only 250 metres, but it takes the exhausted carriers over 40 minutes to rise at a turtle pace up because they maintain balance and carefully reconsider their steps to not slip and collapse into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed from Kawah Ijen rocks years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they are at the top, they travel around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they tirelessly carry heavy weight baskets, which the mining company placed slightly lower, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
It is a PT Candi Ngrimbi company that has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Because it is commonly carried 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," Anto, who usually travels three trips a day, explains.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end he is devastated, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although this seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what he would have made in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for coffee collection, and the salary in two weeks is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on Bali as a bricklayer on the tourist island.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he has trouble breathing, he still coughs, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto three times a day risks life in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already started to collect its toll on him, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than decent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man affected by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead does the work of a porter.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at 2:00 in the morning, as sulfur does not stop to air out at night, and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and September by darkness.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto goes into the crater and illuminates the path with a small lamp attached to his helmet and bought it himself with his money.
About 400 carriers bring out on the shoulders of a basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, the extraction of sulphur due to cost savings did not mechanize or provide carriers working on their own and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from a photography bonus, which, along with a 15,000 rupee ticket (1.2 euros), is selected by park rangers from tourists arriving to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for people," Madrusin, a robust 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades, has been saying since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will last as long as possible, because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and pinches in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and grabs miners in dense fumes that come out of the volcano, miners are so claiming that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases...but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by weight baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at his 53 years of age.
Each day he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulphur in a volcano, which then three trucks take a steep route between the thicket to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik declares, opening wide the mouth, in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons he is the eldest, thirty years old, he also earns by mining sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans seduce the fact that they do not have children, careers, stress, and cost of living and education.
"The Singapore Occupancy Needs Growth".
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a Menthol Candy ad, but yet - or maybe that's why - the video has massively spread to YouTube early this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local innuendos such as "put a bun in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
The art director of the Douglas Hamilton agency says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people "fulfill their civic duty".
"This is a matter exclusively of the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that this is a topic we need to touch.
We knew the government was trying to expand perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not quite functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative possible thing, such as the composition of a rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it too lightly is the Singaporean government.
Each year, they spend $1,300 to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
However, all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city state with advanced technology in the southeast of Asia, also known for the conservatism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with respect to population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Bureau of Population says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of opportunities in terms of life's goals and priorities, it is not just a wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increasing the number of single people and to postponing marriage and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
While there were attempts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this has provoked displeasure among local residents.
Some Singaporean websites show unhidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and a small effort for integration.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the Government Party of Singapore recorded its worst electoral result since the beginning of independence last year.
After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known implications for national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, some unexpected consequences have also occurred in Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support a bachelor’s lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the development company EL Developers, claims that their "boot-boxes" sell much faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular, by selling day to week faster than houses with more size.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could be directed towards increasing the birth rate of the nation, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore many people postpone it," says a young official.
"Let the others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old, young man.
Men and women mention career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons to prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, they are ultimately Singaporeans who have the last word about starting a family.
What is private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal character or "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption".
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does it apply this definition in its daily life and social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the term privacy to be "something entirely of their own" on a personal level and as a "user name and password" if it was social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my biggest secret," says ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she claims.
"I put nice pictures or pictures of us playing on FB.
I'm talking to friends there, too.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine, or a photo that would mock someone," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'm just putting them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended an unsub.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks, and at the latest mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his friend list.
"I'm not afraid of this because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were directing him or asking him for an address or phone number.
"If they push me or demand me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is not a stranger's experience with what is today called cyberbullying.
"A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't check out of the account.
"Just activated a private regime."
It then explains a series of steps how to securely set the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and graduate in the field of Education and Teaching, believes that children and adolescents need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them correctly.
It states that: "Internet originated as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Aboriginals and Digital Immigrants, introduced these terms to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are learning ourselves," he says.
It explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it".
Also, to be discreet about the surroundings, at a time when what they desire most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do anything doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like someone to post your picture the way you posted your friend's?
You know what other people publish about you?
When you mark the persons in the photos from the celebrations, did you ask these persons for permission?
And one more: do everyone always need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to make them realize that they have to behave in the Internet environment as well as outside of it.
They're the same rules.
"Man follows respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet, and it should be the same on social networks," he claims.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first degree teacher, and educational advisor explains the need for children's parents to carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If they understand every insidious thing, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences they may have of setting up an account on the Internet.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
Guardia believes that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "do not talk to strangers".
South America Summit ends and Declaration from Lima has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and reportedly signed by the seven Presidents present.
Efe repeatedly attempted to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and presidential offices, who at the beginning determined to publish the document after the summit ended, said it would later be published on the Peruvian government's website.
They also stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several brief press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential unsound assembly was transmitted in the press room with a message "confidential session, sound transmission prevented".
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by press speakers of some governments who were present, but not by the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the negotiations was a list of participating presidents, prompting the diselection of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent out an e-mail to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but this is just a statement from President Humala, and not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion the originally promised Declaration from Lima was not published, although it was eagerly demanded by the press.
On the ASPA official website it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists were broadcast, but they completely prevented the input of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment from Chile and Peru to the adoption of a judgment by the Hague Court which resolves the dispute over the border between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President of Chile Sebastian Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin hearing the defence speech of both parties discussing the dispute that Lima initiated against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," said President Humala along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful dispute resolution, conventions, and international courts," he added, adding, and greeting President Humala with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice was published this week after Colombia had adopted the Bogot Pact, thus expressing submission to the judgments of the international court which had decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely flawed.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from the Unasur organization in 2011 after the withdrawal of then-President Fernando Lug and did not attend the meeting.
The host president of Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and ending the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects between South American countries were planned, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are extended".
He informed that actions were supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap Internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) does not have a winning essence, but is intended to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of various South America locations, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic links," the President of Peru said in a read speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concerned Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned a better connection with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring her back to the Union of South American Nations", from which she is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday, Mexico, to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the maritime border dispute, which is disputed by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, not even a contract with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to participate in the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
As part of the summit, the Union Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the area's defence.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country mentioned is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case really, must teach from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, stated on TV Perú's state television that Europeans "killed for World War II" and in other conflicts, "but are now practically one country".
In this sense, the project defended the creation of South American citizenship, which the member countries of Unasur support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean community, however, there are still backward areas that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The President of Ecuador said, among other things, that he agrees to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who signed the San José Human Rights Pact will be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," he said in a reference to the political asylum provided by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles by it, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish Justice, which asked him to submit to questioning in Swedish territory due to alleged sexual offense, with "his own Swedish legislation allowing him to conduct an interview with a video conference call that could take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and psychological health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she was having minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental state threatens to worsen because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving on fresh air.
This would affect everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks with London had taken place to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón runs a series of proceedings in various European instances," he mentioned.
He stated that "if Great Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over".
And if Sweden listens to Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or through Skype, as the legislation there allows and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be brought to an end tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, clarifying that he certainly does not tolerate "substandardity, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, the wicked and the perverted politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither such journalists, "not bankers, nor hegemon countries, nor bourgeoisies control Ecuador", saying that if he is re-elected, "he will continue to change in the right direction and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay on membership of the Unasur Union until at least its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and puchism wrapped up in legality", as it in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian president stated that he considered "a completely appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time following the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The sentence is not accepted at the moment.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed wide in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope in settling the maritime border dispute that he is dealing with in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit themselves to accepting a judgment, no matter how harsh it is".
In the context of the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador to bid for the third mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa stated that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
"I personally have never been interested in much, but only political powers can correct such unfair situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last presidential term and then I would have retired from politics.
If we lose, I'm going to lose the same thing.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned a new medical treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madur, who says President Chávez left for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the state of health of the President," he explained.
Today, the head of the Ecuadorian state participated in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a lightning had struck me," he relates in remembrance of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "relax a little", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the earliest HIV unit patients at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, neither the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) said goodbye to him, "because he had a cut".
Having AIDS back then was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who do not know about their illness and come only when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and has killed the immune system and become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a great success that the life expectancy of the patient, who will begin treatment in a timely and appropriate manner, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, stating that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that AIDS has been a death sentence since 2008, but that survival and full-fledged life depend on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, with better off those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that whoever is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "live without problems while maintaining treatment until the age of 75", explained the doctor in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it should be recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 today.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of persons who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS yearbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since AIDS was discovered, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far until this May. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been assured since 2005.
Why do people continue to die from illness?
- "I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted supplies of medicines.The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the disease condition, or at a late stage of the disease."
It adds a convincing indication: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is already manifested. The only thing we need to do to control the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore, on a large scale, it is necessary to offer tests to identify the disease to all those who ask for it".
In his proposal, he coincides with specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to get tests done at a private laboratory only because his friend did so, and despite his low age he had already developed AIDS disease and also suffered from Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather go crazy three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for the better, eating healthy, practicing, taking medication."
To this day, his parents know only that he has suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I look after myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted the call to share his experiences with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid today as part of World AIDS Day.
And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarises the motto of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a large gap between health programs and common citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is looking for information on HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are engaged in this task, "the handout of condoms was actually increased, they used to give us one or two, today they give us a hundred packs of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most susceptible to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and medical staff who teenagers want to avoid, says a reporter.
He suggested changing this ineffective distribution, so that condoms are not just behind counters, but that the 100 be found in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It is not support for promiscuity.
It's not even about "paying them beer and motel", as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
The best thing to do is to make condoms available to those who already have sex," he remarked.
Keywords in the state of Jalisco
13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases) have been reported.
This condition means fourth place in Mexico in new and identified AIDS cases and 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the disease is sexual, 6% of the blood route y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are four to five people who do not know about the disease for one registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt as determined by the bankruptcy in Mexico, raises an unfortunate precedent for any national firm with branches in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Thus, the restructuring procedures of companies that allow Mexican laws do not seem to apply in the land of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
On June 15, last year, Judge Harlin Hale leaves in practice a Mexican firm without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the verdict opens the door to the United States Supreme Court of Mexico's main glass producer, appealing against three irregularities.
First of all, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the United States Insolvency Act, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure sets out bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of the insolvency of multinational enterprises.
Basically, a model United Nations law was created to unify international trade law, which is determined by the arbiter to the American Law Institute.
Second, the judgment states that, without the vote of branches from the internal corporate structure, when Vitro’s parent company’s debt to the branches is recognised, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not be reached.
Nevertheless, Mexican laws admit this possibility.
The fact is that Vitro's case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose intra-corporate debts were guaranteed by the Federal bankruptcy institute.
Moreover, it is true that even after deduction of the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in a court in the United States, i.e. funds of "supposers" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
That information shall not be taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of the serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company González Sady will appeal for a new assessment directly at the Court of Appeals to make the assessment with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since only three initially voted.
If he fails here, he will demand, as an appeal, a revision of the process by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
On the case, it is important that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae unit, in which Vitro's procedure under the Competition Act is detailed and that it points out that the company had eased itself by inclined to agreements signed by both countries to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, rules for international insolvency cases guaranteeing equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro company and state.
Overall evaluation
A few months of criminal announcement by the Mexican Aviation Departments against the former owner of Gastón Azcarrag Andrade, who was accused of fraud, was on the table, and according to the pilot union, the vessel had already overflowed.
An instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstructions in justice.
According to the Authority, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction by that entrepreneur, in which it withdrew 198 million pesos from IXE from fideikomis F/589 on behalf of Mexican aviation.
The funds were probably directed towards buying the shares of Professional Hotel Management (Administrdora Professional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas chain of hotels.
Dragon Mart Siege
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens who approved the formation of the association met at Universidad de Caribe this weekend to prevent the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge trading and distribution centre with products from a "large wall country" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Earlier, the Canacintra organization (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unite the Southeast Zone governors to oppose a monumental area that would partially devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the ACTA document
The request by the Senate, which was disregarded by the Government, requesting an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial), has lost its status.
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of treating it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to repay long-term debts and not affect those short-term development company Homex places investment certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer interest repayment every 28 days.
Competival is born
By combining leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, a trade name association named Competival was born, the aim of which will be the software services market in Central and South America.
Investing in business exceeds $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: " Basketball was my life"
Basketball world runner Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this hall sport for over 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was attracted by a stroke on a wheelchair in 2008, enthused in this sport for over 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, a BSN national basketball league player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I have held a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several simultaneously, as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general executive of the national team and chairman of the federation," Reyes recalled while visiting reporters of Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has been living with Isabel, his loyal wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest emotion of all, he guards those who resemble his work in the Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"That was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to take part in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I parted ways with one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
That's when the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and at that time worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a grown two-metre player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to quarterback Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamona a victory in the championship, Gausse would then contribute to the next."
He enjoyed the championship, when he played Gausse for the team, but only remotely, because he had already served as president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position on the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the 1989 Mexican qualifying Olympic match.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we finished the quarter, but we should have had bronze not for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final pitch," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Championships the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and whipped out a United States team that was pretty similar to the one that blew out the bronze for us at the World Championships.
This team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fica López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been on the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
The team, who may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic Qualification in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on the roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players eliminated due to a skirmish in the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was Piculin Ortiz without any doubt.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his involvement in various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla very much from my youngsters.
Which success in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national BSN league had in one season up to 17 teams.
What didn't you have time to prove?
There were things I wanted to implement, like dividing youth categories by regions.
For example, that Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music the most, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman Died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, world famous starring John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, in which he embodied a man who acted unscrupulously and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil mogul J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series became a symbol of laxity in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official family announcement provided to the Associated Press by the production company Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon for cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he re-played the iconic role he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in the Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane announced.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, fun, kind, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the full," said Linda Gray in the announcement.
The Hagmans diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman subjected himself to a transplant.
Years before the Dallas show, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie aired by NBC Station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (jina), played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performance in the films included roles that were well received by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was up to Hangman's masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star top.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotion slogan "Who Shot Jüjár?", which was intended to raise expectations about a work of emotion when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only an enormous number of spectators' speculation around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in betting offices.
This also helped this episode to achieve a record in ratings.
The November episode of 1980, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after the end of the broadcast of the MASH series in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) fired at J.R.
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be put in rehab.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on screen and outside."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"The filming of five parts of the second row has already been completed and the sixth was just spinning," the television station announced.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT station on how the show would proceed.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as South Pacific musicals and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried happiness on theatre scenes in New York City and then served in England in the Air Force between 1952 and 1956.
There he met young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published an autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm anyone," he told Prensa Associateda.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he assisted frightful patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, meet them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
The course that explores the "end of the world" begins.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take an end-of-the-world course this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which is due to come on December 21, has caught many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was ahead of him in the next few months: Catastrophe Hurricane Sandy, a budget gap that some call "the debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict into which Israel is drawn, a place in which, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for apocalyptics.
And that's not the only professor who offers "end of the world" courses in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, the assistant professor Barry Vacer holds the course "Meanings, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas are expanding with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and exploring how different they are from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students of what is possible, likely, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an expert assistant in art history and anthropology, joined together to hold a course called The End of the World.
"We don't add '2012' because we always count on the possibility of organizing a course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite "threatful destruction", students must study, create projects and do final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the evening of the predicted end of the world", said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He spread out within two hours," Restall said about his course for high-average students, who applied for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we were asked by e-mail if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
So apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which this could be taught before," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no interviewed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the end date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan predictions and in some way we refute it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University of West Chester.
"May never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings by predictions of the end of the world.
The rise of these speculations was caused by the Internet.
"Other people don't think about it," he said.
This is done in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who lectures in the Philippines this year, answered quickly to ask if he knew of a course there about "the end of the world."
"Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception to the Supreme Authority.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there were talk of many days of the last judgment, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will perish.
The date is taken lightly by both students and professors.
Several have said they intend to go to the "end of the world" festival.
"I'll probably call some friends to laugh together," explained 20-year-old communication student Samira Ford.
