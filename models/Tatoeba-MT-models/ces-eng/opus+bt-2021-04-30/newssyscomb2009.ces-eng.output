A right-wing populist triumph in Austria, together with 29 percent
The visible weakening of both sides of the so far large coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties, according to the early results of Sunday's early parliamentary election in Austria, resulted.
Particularly strong losses were suffered by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Corutan Governor Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the last 2006 elections.
Even worse, ÖVP, who loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these large parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially among the people who provoked early elections, literally a disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP stepped out of the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead in favour of SPÖ.
However, voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
As early as the first reactions to the results, speculation was expressed about the possible resignation of party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers consider that this could happen on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the way to the ever-likeliest way out of the election result, namely to restore the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ), they provisionally gained 18 percent and BZÖ received eleven percent of the vote - but social democrats also voiced concerns about the repeat of 1999, when the People's People agreed with the populists (then FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split off from BZÖ) on a joint government that even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider is clearly betting on this development, which has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and is expecting to return to Vienna in national politics.
However, the Green Party came to parliament but slightly lost and fell among Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently overcame the 4% threshold and did not make it to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India Can Cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of illegal picking bugs in India could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister stated this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji.
"If it hadn't been solved, then yes, then some cooling would have occurred," he said after a meeting that took place on the Czech initiative.
After the hearing, Mukherji said that the executive could be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Švacha, who was acquitted and punished by a fine, the central government may negotiate with the local government in Dardžiling, within whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the sentence to be released, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself in the hearing.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicted, said the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian Party was already providing such help.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining with India the best relationships that have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as CTK said, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a deep mistake to incarcerate and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided the answer to the question whether he had been given the Indian party the promise to deal with matters.
"I've had quite enough promises," he said only.
Bohemia judges the battle for the seabed
They will proceed to a wall electronic map showing Australia and adjacent sea areas.
He does not care about the continent, however, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team of UN personnel on Ocean Affairs and Law.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally completes it.
There's work vigour and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores, and other mineral materials can be found here, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Bottom greater than land
Today, coastal states began to bid for new underwater territories vehemently.
According to the UN Convention, they use their rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it has exclusive rights to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly, the continental shelf has that part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf shall be accompanied by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five requests, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last countries have succeeded so far," adds Mikulka.
The world's response recently recorded Australia's success, which was the first to substantially expand its underwater grips.
But New Zealand, too, has gained the seabed area that the commission admitted to it last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits that will flow in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other States shall submit their requests gradually.
They can do so up to ten years from the moment they ratified the "Convention of Montego Bay".
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean bottom area begins, a convention declared to be the "common heritage of mankind".
No state has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right of mining in this area is conferred by the Convention established by the International Institution.
"The sea bottom, however, is no Klondajk", says Director Mikulka in exaggeration, saying that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually enshrined".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They share them with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, according to the Convention, as did investors of a few other states, it acquired the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It is authorised to mine in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor-explored area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken there, it is a sort of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be mined there on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian Rober Sandev division worker brings to show you one such concretion.
It resembles a small potato or, in a bit of fantasy, a fabled shema that, according to legend, revived Golem.
The German Special Forces were in the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, special forces were ready, but there was no deployment.
More details of the circumstances of the liberation of eleven in Egypt of kidnapped European tourists are gradually being made public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior data, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue.
According to the ministry's observations, both Federal Army experts and members of the German GSG9 Police Anti-Terrorism Group, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Criminal Office, and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the scene of the liberation.
However, according to another message by both ministries' speakers from Monday afternoon, German forces were not needed, as the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government reportedly adopted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for the on-site event.
"Happily, this did not happen," said one of the spokespersons of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and also eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area in the south of Egypt, they moved hostages in border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the liberation or possible ransom payment.
At present, they're safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that hostage liberation is in the custody of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of the release.
No information is yet available in Berlin when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", all five tourists with special forces should leave one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress let the $700 billion bailout package fall by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones Index fell heavily.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both sides, the majority has not been found for a program that should alleviate the turmoil in the financial markets.
After all, with a dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called for the Member's approval before voting, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he acknowledged.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones index dropped by more than six percent, or by 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concerns that the state rescue package could be forfeited.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index increased, so that it would fall again steeply after the announcement of the package's shipwreck.
Experts now count on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the House of Representatives and the Senate must agree.
Travel agents record increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, there was a significant turnover for the next month's booking of tours compared to the previous year - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the German's appetite to travel remains unturbed.
For reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded an increase in turnover of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as reported by the German Travel Union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Survey Institute, there are already increased numbers of reservations available for autumn months.
Thus, according to the comments of the DRC for October compared to 2007, the turnover was about 11 percent higher.
The basis for these results are GfK numbers, which every month evaluates reservation data from 1,200 German travel agencies and interpolates them on the overall market.
This result included booking tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, mainly US trips are required, said the DRV.
With these routes, the addition of reservations is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable for the Germans.
Mainly organized tours are on course, stated the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising energy and food spending, the cost here is "more costable for a client than for an individual organised holiday".
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations is said to be very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who have made some journey has declined compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Infinitely repeated pops, beer made of butt plugs and prominents in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, television host and wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my clothes are secondhand.
But one thing that connects us: we are not even three minutes in a beer meadow yet, and already photographers are throwing themselves at us and they are filling up memory cards - that is flattering, I am on Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
My cheap costume seems to have served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my feeling of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's costume or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The only thing that gets special looks at a banana stand in chocolate is my apron.
A Munich woman warns me that I have wrongly tied her up: "On the left you are free, in the middle of a virgin, married to the right, widowed in the back."
I'll secretly flip my bow from behind to the left.
"Well," he says and laughs.
Others don't deal with subtle flirting techniques so much and wear simple felt hats with the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and stick to passers-by naked asses.
The young man with such flashing tendencies is called Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He feels "gorgeous", with an extended "ooh".
That's what he's telling me after he's relieved of just drinking butter.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
Bob is therefore one of the dreaded "Wildbieslers", as in Bavaria is called in public to freely urinate people.
Others don't have the happiness of getting rid of alcohol that way.
Around 8:00 p.m., Oktoberfest runs around the area where the Oktoberfest takes place, a crowd of paramedics who must take care of poor drinkers.
Medics always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to beer meadows: empty there, full back.
You can't see who's lying under this coffin's sail.
"That's enough that can't go on," one of the medics calls me in response to my question and disappears in the crowd.
Police released the name of the accident victim
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson from the Chelmsford Road there.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was detained on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are widening
Long before Turkey began its efforts to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into Turkish entanglement.
On the eastern bank of Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition stands.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
Well, that's what the tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits flanked at the end of platforms with a tower on every corner of the façade, looking at the undistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone's dirty.
The whole structure is slowly falling apart.
But once a man gets inside a vault vault, he can no longer have any doubt about the size of the business whose westernmost gate the station was.
The station opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatoliy-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East using this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond, in the territory that is Saudi Arabia today.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by the frozen Cold War border, is gone
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came for Hydarpasha Station, too.
In 1917, an ammunition train explosion destroyed her elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, they have been crumbling and history has gone round it.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the widening horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen Cold War border, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the leading AKP experts on foreign policy, the Turkish MP Suat Kinikniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a squirming ride on tracks that reminded the old-world rhythms of the well-known documentary Night Post, I arrived at the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state, who wants to turn his back on his Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
In the west, she aroused suspicions, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main tent of the AKP, an ultramodern stone and metal building, deliberately built in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-built department stores and power stores, where middle managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to do early morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a center-right politician from almost every other European political party.
The jacket, the tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The purpose of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its detention.
Today they must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But there will certainly come a time," I asked, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey", he said, "didn't want such a decision to take place."
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost by heart: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea neighborhood are equally for the benefit of Europe and the United States as well as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, ride these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another mostly sleepwalking night, I thought of those two German lords Herr Ritter and Herr Con who watched this building be built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that European ambitions in the Middle East can now, for the most part, be in Turkish hands.
And while I was waiting at the port for the ferry back through Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorial Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes in : As a Guildford music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (an obituary, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district musical plan, he founded a year on it an excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be under the age of 21, but by the time Proteus sang the last time in 1979, several of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (a mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to embark on whatever music was presented to him - whether madrigals or Messiaen, whether alone or with the entire orchestra.
Music adaptability created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for music, which remained absolutely immutable all the time.
How often only Tod told us to "let the music speak for ourselves".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it! "
His batting technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "drawn one or two soaked stones around the world".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (25 September) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Hublon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author's note at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication by the British rubber industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Hublon-Norman and summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he definitively left Nottingham and switched to Illinois.
It is unknown why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was intrigued by the simplicity and the strong charge with which it affects the viewers, and by the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda attacks for the second time with her bestseller
In November, Honda launches the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle has already had considerable space, it now offers even more spacious interiors.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes in this single-space car.
It is important to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
So the first thing we're going to notice is that Honda needed a shorter period than other producers to rejuvenate this model.
Although Jazz is a less known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in sales in other markets.
This is, for example, the case of Japan, a country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Almost a million pieces have been sold since the launch of Honda Jazz in Japan.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million sold pieces in six years.
However, Honda aims to make the new Jazz increase sales in its category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Hondy Jazz in 2007, estimates in 2009 count 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, meaning 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 pieces per year.
It is the arrival of a new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the car company thus de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% of last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid of compact size with a length of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises to sell approximately 200,000 pieces worldwide each year.
As far as markets are concerned, it is estimated that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will divide the old continent and Japan.
The launch of Honda Insight's sale is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is introduced to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions increased in the new Jazz.
Its length increased to 3.9 metres (five centimetres more), width to 1.69 metres (two centimetres more) and wheelbase to 2.5 metres, meaning an extension of five centimetres.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
Enlarged dimensions have also increased the interior space.
This advantage was achieved by using both a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which had already been used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the luggage compartment in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur for the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage compartment volume for Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an 80 degree opening angle compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
With the second generation Honda Jazz, there are new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings an excellent improvement of the propulsion system at the same time with a high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 hp in the previous generation of the Jazz car - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and an emission of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with a power of 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto bee" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan inspired the development of accident prevention technologies in nature, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes the role of flying bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed in collaboration with the Center for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, Director General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan security shield.
The robot is tasked with strengthening the ability to prevent precipitation in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
However, the most important are folded bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are located up to two metres in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"At the moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot mimics bee movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to a right or even greater angle to prevent collision.
The biggest difference to any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction by which it is allowed to turn its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as with bees.
Nissan therefore used the rotation function to prevent collision in addition to acceleration and deceleration.
"The facility only needs to process the information every few seconds and to keep up with these data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, making it possible to operate without interruption with only two dozen kB memories.
This may surprise you, but we don't talk about gigs or megas in memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of precipitation, a technology for which Nissan predicts use for serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy your fear before you take the mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Department of Finance, apart from having enough capital to give away injections, lacks ingenuity.
Facing the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages from banks with questionable solvency, it created a popular-learning game on the Internet "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a mixed-up hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look gloomy to think once, twice or three times about whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, though not very detailed.
It is a site more suitable for young people than for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
A dream room appears inside the hotel.
At least something, 'cause you'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens his MUFG capital
The Bank House of Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank to spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital, accompanied by a significant decline in its exchange rate.
A week after revealing their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was planning to buy 9.9% of current Morgan Stanley shares at a single price of $25.25, representing a total sum of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in obtaining convertible securities that provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average uniform price of $29, i.e. 28% below his current rate.
The shares of Morgan Stanley nevertheless lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 around 17.00 greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to speeding up Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of bank holding," explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which is intended to enable him to diversify his activities, but it also puts him under the control of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest aces to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The conditions introduced on Monday, among other things, show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan has only announced that it will sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for roughly $8.5 billion.
"We thought until a week ago," Tokiu Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to limit risks to a minimum and also cover."
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley's securities by 7% less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a decrease in profits from the stock by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a period of time at a price of 50 % above the exchange price, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by the MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the group's spokesperson refused to provide specific information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast of the Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan specified that since late August, he had "tightly" lowered his balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of default associated with debt have increased sharply.
These costs took on opposite developments on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivors" from Wall Street's large investment banks following the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's buyout, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Relaunch the republic around the XXI century socialism.
This is a joint project by Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third named submitted for vote, following the pattern of his counterparts and friends, a proposal for a new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted 'yes' in the referendum.
"No" according to these results was 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order to accept the draft Constitution, it had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit of the polls and a calculation of the NGO predicted a clear victory of 'yes' on Sunday, with a range of 63% to 70%.
After all, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night to Monday.
"The constitution won the whole line," he assured and congratulated Ecuadorians at Guayaquil gubernatorial residence, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Organisation of States of America observation mission (OEA), took place calmly, concerned the text on 444 points building a "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the state's power over economics by reserveing it a "planning for development" of a country living primarily from oil mining by foreign companies and from foreign exchange, which is being sent by its emigrants.
The proposal endorsed by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, which will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to disband the House.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution consolidates the principle of free health and education, which the President began to implement in a country with a population of 13.9 million, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thus ending the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of U.S. drug operations.
19 hostages were liberated in Chad
The Egyptian commando took an attack by the hijacker of eleven tourists and their eight-man escort who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were alive on Monday and safely transported to the Egyptian capital.
An Egyptian commando liberated them in Chad during the morning.
Hostages arrived around 3.30 p.m., apparently in good form, aboard a special aircraft to a military base al-Maza, narrowly adjacent to the Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred without being able to comment in print, aboard helicopters to a hospital in Maadi, the peripheral residential district of Cairo to be subjected to medical examinations there.
"They are perfectly well" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers", declared Egyptian Minister of Tourism to Zohejer Garrana on the airport's taxiway.
Since its capture on September 19 during a safari in a four-wheel drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan, and Libya, a group of hostages were dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of the agency Aegyptus, an organizer of the safari.
A leading representative of the Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 special forces who approached the site on board two helicopters set off on a trail during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces from the unit "glitter" were sent to Sudan, where they gained support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret services, from special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the eve of the Sudanese army stated that, while patrolling, they intercepted a four-wheel drive vehicle with hijackers on board, killing six of them including a Chadian commander and arresting two.
The military claimed they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Quiet Most of the Ministry of Culture
The debate about the funding of culture fills the pages of the newspaper with thumb headlines and is the topic of the currently ongoing election campaign.
The better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to pillage poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national landmarks that are starving?
What politician dares remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organizations, in synergy.
In Quebec, in the federation of societies for the history of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers combined into 211 societies for history, monuments, archives, and genealogy to uncover history, preserve a heap of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a few minors.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, driven by hopeless protests when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the bleachers for history and monuments?
Benelux governments from the state portion of Fortis bank
Benelux states will help the Belgian-Dutch bank, Fortis, who was the first to get in trouble in Europe due to the widespread effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalization: the three countries will support the money and insurance institution, which also has capital participation in Hungary, with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch Governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition, agreed on this at the highest level this weekend.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be seen as precedents in the context of the international financial market crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year.
In the sense of the decision that was born on Sunday night, all three states will redeem almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets.
The bank will sell with absolute certainty some of its capital participations, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The shares of Fortis bank began to decline sharply last week, and by the second half of the week serious signs of the crisis had already appeared in the Institute.
Analysts agree, however, that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's securities fell only 12 percent on Friday, at a minimum of 14 years.
As of January, the value of the shares declined by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the group’s total market capital value is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s leaders, this is unrealistic.
After all, the management blames the fall of Fortis shares on the overseas market related to the adoption of a $700 billion US package plan.
By Monday, the stock had already increased slightly.
On Friday a new CEO Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank.
The Institute of Money has also been looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer no one has yet claimed.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors need not worry, they will not lose their money.
The bank's clients still haven't had a panic, and the branches haven't been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also purchased several leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the henhouse to a fox," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies shall make premiums and amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health of the candidates and shall not, if the risk is assessed as being too large, close the insurance with them.
They had previously sent the person concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number of the customer from the pharmacies, he easily finds out what drugs the person has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself will deduce how he suffers from the disease and what his health condition is.
For example, if she regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to her having virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts her in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of them determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so there is almost no work left for the insurance company except for paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that many medicines can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, usable against migraines or hot flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-enhancing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, whereas the first-named difficulties are not.
In order to request and process data, special companies were created that would ask the patient for permission before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, even though they have not punished them for their negligence so far.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory tests, which combine with data on the medicines used, which can provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, while controlling their use will become increasingly complex.
There is a special law to protect health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which gives the authorities the power to control even businesses specializing in data provision, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his program so that the transfer of data is bound to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that it can hardly deny the permission in question, otherwise insurance companies will not enter into a contract with it.
So, after all, the hens are somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union and India will double the trade turnover
As the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, this issue was dominated by other, mostly global problems, the agenda of the ninth meeting at the highest level.
Today, there will also be a Franco-Indian summit, which will be primarily about nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power, which should be given more opportunity to speak on international matters, but the Member States have not yet managed to find a common denominator on the issue of promoting the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at the last night, already the ninth summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union and President of the European Commission, respectively, José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the trade turnover within five years, or rise to more than one hundred billion euros.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overly ambitious objective.
In a sign of this, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were legally aligned, so air transport also got green in the future.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would like to sign a free trade agreement.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi ranks among the EU's partners only in ninth place.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, respectively - both sides condemned the situation in all its forms and called for an urgent meeting of the UN Conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha Round of Trade Negotiations, although both have a large share in its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least twenty percent by 2020.
This was also agreed by India, as well as by the need to conclude a global agreement at the next year's climate conference and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convocation of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will travel to the French capital today, where he is planning to enter into trade at a bilateral meeting concerning the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes that French firms will receive mandates to build 20 billion euro worth of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to agency reports, the agreement would have been valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmess, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take up the 171,790 sqm fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – at 264 square metres of exhibition space.
There will be a meeting with the press at Room Structure Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, tendencies and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to data, the importance of books by foreign authors is still diminishing in proportion to total Italian production, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, was found flying over a desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, at the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that still remained: "The aircraft was found, we sent a team there, and now we're sure it's exactly what Steve Fossett flew in the day he disappeared" he said at one press conference.
The sheriff thus specified that human remains were found neither in the plane nor in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (Ntsb) announced that an investigation team was sent a few hours after the debris recognition, which eventually identified the aircraft: exactly Bellancu 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossetto's personal items were found by one pair near their dwelling in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash money and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks flight alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world on a plane without landing.
His many records also include a flight at an altitude of 15.445 metres, above the Andami, though with a copilot.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk born from the "compact" jeeps of the star house, using which Mercedes-Benz attempted to bring a vortex to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional processing that unexpected and unconventional communication will accompany the marketing of Suv Glk and will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also start an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milanese business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Really, when you look at the picture, you'll feel like the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology of Elumina8, the new Glk will be enlightened in various moments in all its little things to then reassemble in a single picture.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of automobile communications through this advertisement.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way?
So now we know who Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching Nazionale azzurr for years and who, to be honest, has never made excessive problems.
She never even met the fans of the opponent.
Group orientation is right-wing.
Founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact, few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday night they removed them so they would not be recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made 144 tickets for the match available to Italian fans: all in name, therefore easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with ongoing Dasle, no one who would be forbidden to visit stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous stadium offenses were denied the ticket and banned the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read news that will come from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during riots.
The international Daspo, which prohibits attending not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will never enter another stadium.
To happiness.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means more than 150 will be added to those.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not justify those who behave in this way", confirm from Viminal.
So, "severely open eyes, mainly because of the national game on Wednesday in Lechi".
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia right now.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, Tuesday Casms, who can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that handles the problems at the stadiums.
"The Chorus Leader-Leader and the Tended Arms During Mameli's Anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way) who is the director of the Viminal Osservatorium for a few weeks (he gained a place that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Trieste, where there is a core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate leaders, but, of course, the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Osservatorian number one - crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far, this group has remained within limits, and now we're going to take a good look at what happened, and we're going to evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistling at Mameli's anthem: it's not even a crime, but if you don't mind, it's rude...".
