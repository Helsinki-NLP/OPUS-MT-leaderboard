Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
The 28 - year - old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says that he can’t think of anyone who would want to hurt him, adding: “Finally, he began to prosper. ”
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, reported by the medical examiner's office.
San Francisco Police Department has reported that this is a violent death and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for ABC's KGO station in San Francisco said Frank, who had previously been a line cook in Boston, earned his dream chef job at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that they were “shocked and destroyed” by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close family. We will miss them very much," said the spokesperson.
In these difficult times, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first spent the night at the dorms, but that he had recently “become successful. ”
"He found an apartment, dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any argument.
He was a brother who took things as they are.
"Even if everything else in the world were wrong, he was an uncut diamond that irradiated every day", he said.

ČD has invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the amount of modernisation in each year, except for 2012, is gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, ČD has invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent appeared to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was placed by the carrier in regional transport, where roughly 60 percent of the said money was directed, and 40 percent were invested in the recovery of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years old.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of ČD driving vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger wagons are slightly older, whose average age is 23 years when set up by modernization.
If only the age from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, classic train sets consisting of wagons and towed locomotives are gradually disappearing from the Czech and worldwide railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 units, similarly the number of classic wagons fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier mainly disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From investments that ČD plans to make in the near future into the fleet, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic express train lines.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
Authorities know about illegal advertising for three months, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online daily Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where it is not only a touristic walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
Highway rangers know it's black, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads all over the country.
According to officials, there is a flimsy law to blame, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
In the meantime, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or you just have to move the ad a few yards, and the official process has to start over.
The Roads and Highways Directorate admitted three months ago: at the main haul from České Budějovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard stands black on our property near the state road.
Even three months, however, officials were not enough to dispose of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one cares that they're standing right next to the road, in a 50-metre protection zone where, for safety reasons, nothing can happen.
Road managers say they can't easily deal with a billboard due to a leaky law.
Maybe load him up and drive him away.
"We must not afford this," says Nina Ledvinová, the spokesperson for the Road and Highway Directorate, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to follow the online daily Aktuálně.cz closely in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot deal with effectively and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
Other regions are similarly involved.
"We are having trouble getting companies to remove the banners," says the head of the Transport Department of the Czech Budejovice Regional Authority Jiří Klása, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klasa, there is a leaky law on the fault that binds the officials.
First, he has to address the billboard owner in a difficult way to put the advertisement away.
But the managers of companies are often inadequate or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz described in the past when he became more interested in the issue: it is enough to move the mobile stand with the advertisement a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertising into the basket.
That's because the Bureau has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we must address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
A new law could bring about a change, which will ban billboards by highways from September next year and will limit them even on I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as they have been.
And the authorities won't be relieved.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year in renting illegal areas, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the České Budějovice Magistrate currently runs with her three administrative proceedings for black-built billboards.
The company is threatened with a 300,000 fine in every driving.
These are more ads that were placed in the protection zone of Class I road without permission.
The proceedings are not yet completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Czech Budejovice Magistrate Transport Department.
The advertisement that Aktuálně.cz is interested in is not yet included in these cases, but it will most likely be added to them soon.
According to ŘSD spokesperson Nina Kidney company did not respond to repeated written requests for removal, and the case will thus reach the table of regional and then probably to city officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious firms that can't be contacted.
She does not take over the post office and cancelled the official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind her.
In the past, the company's post office went to South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech Hyundai brand representation.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents Billboard's premises and offers them to advertisers, has in the past rejected any connection.
This spring, when ŘSD became interested in advertising Lipno at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had civil servants send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guest house, where the company is reportedly newly established.
Even from this address, no one has ever heard from highway managers.
A useless fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes to the settlements are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company a few years ago for CZK 2 million.
But she changed her name and ICO, and there was nothing to solve.
The Executor returned the case, the commercials continued, perhaps in other places.
We are powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, under the condition of maintaining anonymity one of the officials.
No one has yet addressed the amendment to the law in this regard.
Currently.cz spoke to several Members who were interested in the problem.
But so far, they haven't developed any activity.
On the contrary, Members who wanted to extend the term for the preservation of billboards in the main Czech communications appeared.
The government denied it.
Billboards are not only for national but also regional and municipal policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them themselves for advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stand for the rather established impression that when something doesn't work, there's a need to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rape and poppy, they estimate statistics.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop has exceeded the average of the last five and ten years.
On the other hand, the rape harvest (3.9 percent) and poppy seed (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers reap 7.2 million tons of grain.
This results from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July according to the state.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth fall against last year.
But last year's grain harvest was above average.
This year's crops exceed the average for the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, there will be a higher harvest of rape and poppy this year.
Growers will reap the beets by 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they received 1,256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected drop in cereal production is due to both a reduction in yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the rotational area.
Farmers have donkeyed three percent less fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to reap 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers planted it in more fields.
However, a lower acre yield will be signed on the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
Roughly one-fifth decline in statistics is assumed by spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
A reduction of 15.2 percent of the crop yield, as well as a lower acre yield, is behind the reduction of the crop.
On the contrary, barley of winter will be born 6.3 percent more.
The rye harvest will also grow.
The yield of rape statistics estimates at 1.305 million tons, which is more against last year.
The area has expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectar yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rape crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, sown on an area a third more extensive than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, the poppy fields have also increased.
This year it was drained by farmers on 35.543 hectares.
Against 2008, when poppy in the Czech Republic was grown on record 70,000 hectares, the fields are half.
This year's crop of poppy will be richer thanks to the expansion of the rotational areas.
It will rise by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons against last year.
But the hectar yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
The Olomouc police charged two men with knife and machete assault, the court sent them into custody.
Police charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in downtown Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the victim tried to escape, they caused him a cutting and cutting injury that required hospital treatment and further treatment," said police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková.
Both obvious perpetrators were apprehended immediately after the attack by police officers.
The prosecutor filed a motion for the court to take them into custody and the court complied with him on Friday.
Both men are facing three to ten years in prison.
Police charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him severe and cutting injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place on Tuesday at noon on Freedom class, reported by police.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informing Olomouc Police Speaker Marie Štrbáková.
A mass skirmish between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal altercation, two assailants attacked using a knife and a machete of a 35-year-old man.
Although the assaulted man tried to escape, they caused him a cutting and cutting injury that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokesperson said.
In a skirmish that attracted great attention in the city centre and caused several police patrols and officers to intervene at the scene, it was family disputes.
Criminalists accused a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc of attempted serious bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a motion for the court to take them into custody and the court granted them on Friday, adding a spokesman.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass fight by attackers five years ago, it happened then only a few tens of meters away, before the disco Varna in Riegrove Street.
Police officials then stated that a group of roughly ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the establishment who were standing outside the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, clubs and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk by them every day.
One of the loudest examples of an unused and empty house is the vast building of the former IPB seat in the middle of Senovážný náměstí.
That should have been a hotel by now.
But there's still nothing.
That there's a need to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several tenement houses, which, despite their location, size and often even monument protection, are only empty and empty.
We have selected properties in the center using the project Emptydomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
Empty houses are more in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special toll for them, he wants an initiative

The Clinton husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year.
They donated over a million dollars to Clinton for charity.
Most of the Clinton income - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
American Democrats' candidates for Hillary Clinton's presidential office released their tax statements on Friday, increasing pressure on their Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP agency.
Most of the Clinton income - over $6 million - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that the Clinton husbands paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, and then a state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump, however, has a problem with a similar step, has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There's a chance Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after her confession was released.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secrets surrounding Trump's revenue, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as wealthy as she claims to be, said the AP agency.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower profit would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for Vice President in tandem with the former First Lady, released a report today on his tax charges over the past ten years.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
In Nigeria, polio erupted again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented rigorous vaccinations and killed doctors.
Cases of polio have reappeared in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared extraordinary vaccinations there, as two children infected with this disease were paralyzed.
Vaccines brought helicopters there.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active in the affected area, who defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, emergency polio vaccination begins because there were two children paralyzed by this disease.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
The Nigerian government announced that a million children and another four million in surrounding states would be vaccinated in the state of Borno.
On Friday, according to the AP agency, Nigerian military helicopters quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the virus had circulated undetected in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made Thursday impossible for doctors to reach the areas where polio children were found.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the eradication of polio Michel Zaffran told BBC station that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long served in the state of Borno.
The area was only made available to international organisations and government early this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country substantially.
Nigerian health minister Isaac Adewole admitted that new cases of polio were a great disappointment to the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated in it.
The WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease had not appeared for two years, it was spreading among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, half of all polio cases in the world were present in Nigeria.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the emotional stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from a gang of pimps.
The Pope listened to their hard life stories and urged them to look confidently into the future.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking by this meeting and call for an increase in the fight against it.
Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes in Rome, whom police freed from the power of a gang of pimps.
For over an hour, the head of the Catholic Church listened to the moved stories of fallen women and subsequently called on them to look confidently into the future, stating a Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes visited by Francis were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one from Tunisia, Italy, and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them were subjected to cruel physical violence, according to the Vatican during forced prostitution.
By visiting Francis, he wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it, said the Pope's spokesman.
František often draws attention to the fates of people on the outskirts of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and June due to his personal invitation.
France will strike Jihadist factories.
But without the help of the Muslims, it will not work.
The Muslims themselves are supposed to help France fight radical Islamism.
Moreover, Prime Minister Manuel Valls' government is preparing major changes in the operation of the mosques and the education of clergymen.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayers.
And others will follow, announced by the Home Secretary.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state to fight those who undermine public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this belief of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams educated in France preach in mosques and mosques.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, the most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
For this reason, the mosques are also visited by preachers who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key that will ensure that he achieves these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should function as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, now operates in the country.
Already then, the Foundation was to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon struck by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls recently said.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate about the new institution that will replace the dysfunctional foundation was on fire.
All hastened by other terrorist attacks in France, carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently let himself be heard that the new foundation will be established this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centres.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal foods.
In practice, the sellers would pay halal meals for certification.
Some of this money would then go to the foundation's register.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
About 30,000 of them go there every year to the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should operate in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is consistent with democracy.
Let's close the Radical Mosques.
At the same time, the French government is campaigning against radicals.
And others will follow, recently announced by the Home Secretary.
There is no place in France for those who proclaim hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
According to estimates, there are about 2500 mosques and mosques in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled roughly 80 imams and consider it for several other tens.
But not everyone thinks that government action can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not the case in mosques, young people radicalize on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Dráhař Kelemen lost in the 1st round of the sprint to star Baugé.
The advance to the eight-finals must be fought by the Czech track cyclist in correcting rides.
Drahý cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the advance from the sprint qualification among the top eighteen lost in the 1st round to the French great Grégory Baugé, defending silver from past games in London.
The advance to the eight-finals must be fought in correcting rides.
27 riders stood on the start of the royal discipline on the track, and the best Czech trackman of the present time has credited himself with the fourteenth best time.
He made the 200 with a fleeting launch in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was thus expected in the qualification of the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Although Kelemen was in the end harassing an experienced Frenchman, he was watching the procedure.
Great performance flashed to gold defense attorney Jason Kenny.
The twenty-eight-year-old Brit drove the third fastest two hundred history and qualified to win in the 9.551 Olympic record.
He then easily dealt with the last advance, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British Quartet was also successful in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins, which in the 4 km fighter race passed a new world record of 3:50.570 and advanced to the final.
To date, the maximum (3:51,659), which belonged to the British for four years from the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Push: Want fresh wind in the industry
Young physicians' representatives gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over the new treaty.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire board to support further field events from early September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issues regarding the contract.
Young doctors and medical students voted to reject the contract agreed with BMA in July.
58 % of its members who took part in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted Thursday night on Twitter, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt stated that the government had remained "still silent" on issues, a great deal to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC executive authority decided by voting down the proposed new treaty completely and to ask for new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to silence by the government today, the JDC Executive Board formally asked for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the running programme of heated field events from early September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to announce to six strikes, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members at pre-vote meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said that the treaty would be a burden for medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of "unlearnable"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to eight months of long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed a Turkish rival to the luxury hall of the Palace in St Petersburg, I felt Ankara wanted to make this reconciliation more.
There's been a handshake, yes.
But Putin was not smiling and barely radiating warmth, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day, some of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin was giving away blows around him and accused Ankara of putting a knife in Moscow's back.
The outrage was even greater that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media for months led a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious were allegations from senior state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But the official message in St Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology he asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared such a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during a failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have obviously shaken it as well.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a hard impact - particularly the abolition of charter flights, which transport several million Russian tourists annually to the coast of Turkey.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will rest assured when flights are renewed.
They earn money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when the import of agricultural commodities from Turkey would be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the newspaper Leads.
However, the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what she sees as a lame reaction to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about EU accession and Putin's accession - which is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly gained bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from elected authorities after attempting a coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it's a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described to me as “combining incompatible”: how two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West join forces.
However, despite publicly showing reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently put itself in the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that after nearly three hours of opening talks, both presidents at a press conference said they had not even mentioned the issue.
Turkey’s president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a complete disaster, when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders are talking to each other again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland station that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of these, she was relieved when she almost died eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was worth millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sport, from the rugby Six Nations championship to the Wimbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not start new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more in the foreground - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our trips to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
BBC Scotland said: "The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and brand for which our employees work because we are now becoming a much more brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, so did the global brand RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts aimed at the home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations Championship, preparing a profile of individual brands sponsoring sports.
"It is a good time for us to move on to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had said that we'd become a great customer bank and introduced those brands.
But along with the way we focused on customer needs and not our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind these brands of trouble, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket riding Predilection led to finish 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured the 3000th win in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was reached by his second victory of the evening on his local track - riding Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden.
Forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat races.
Its predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion, who had previously won on the horse Ghayyar, said: “It’s strange. ”
I'm very touched because my family's here, too.
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when after winning brings Predilection
Two jockeys reached this milestone in obstacle races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, which during his career breaking records led to a goal of over 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the finest jockeys of modern times, and it is not surprising that he reached a milestone that only a few riders had reached before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical fistrón that distinguishes it from the other riders in the dragonfly.
He is a fantastic ambassador of horse racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just go on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie was riding a winner in the UK for the greater part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a vivid nature, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From flying finish to flying jumps - Frankie Dettori was the messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
He survived the plane crash and was banned from launching drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time, returning after a six-month ban, but showed incredible inner strength and all doubters despite returning in the best form.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released the President's office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from his post as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest collaborators for many years.
36-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “released Ivanov from his service to head of the Russian presidential office," but there was no reason.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno was a former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as head of the presidential protocol and presidential office.
When appointed to Putin, he said, "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in the sense of draft laws and control of the extent to which your instructions are followed.
On Friday, Putin reported to the Russian television station that Ivanov had asked for his release from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Convince the smiles?
This move has completely puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest collaborators and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which aired on state television, both men stated that he was leaving the post of chief of the presidential office at his own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once thought of as a possible president wanted to lead Russia's environmental policy suddenly met with great mistrust.
The Kremlin website quotes Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very challenging post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, Ivanov appointed one of his five closest collaborators.
It was even speculated at the time that Ivanov could become the successor to Putin at the head of the state after his second term, as the third period would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But another close colleague of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev, took over the post.
Putin became Prime Minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Thoughts of a Criminal, was released after hitting the director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS television stations producing the series announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his sacking.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement by ABC and CBS television stations, details of the way Gibson's character disappears from the series that follows the stories of an FBI team of agents, a little later.
The 45-year-old actor, who was famous for the lead roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has performed in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the ideas of the criminal, and over the past 12 years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in his statement, which he issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever have hoped for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed fish in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish can be sand eels left behind by a waterstorm.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a short film of his finding on the Periscope channel, thinking that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeter fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects to Fife.
Thus, it is the first of the four caps between the “valvers of the platforms,” which are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all witness how construction engineers used over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge on an impressive scale.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
In its place now is a total of 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, the project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this cap represents the top of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
This is what we did by stretching the northern zoom viaduct 700 millimeters in the south direction.
This was a massive and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and it was necessary to drag it up with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything was going very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive ”
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being flushed by water from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boats station declared an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. British summer time after the crew saw the Moelfre Bay incident.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncut.
"We saw their boat circling near them and we thought the worst," said the helmsman of the Moelfre rescue boat Vince Jones.
"Happily, the strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man aged 60 was found without a life jacket exhausted as he adheres to a buoy.
They were all taken aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the ship had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when it was flipped over.
Someone above these guys held a protective hand.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of Fat Man's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who, according to the indictment, were to receive from Prime Minister Nečas and his then cabinet chief Jana Nagy's political news, a lucrative post for political concessions.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Snajdr, Fuksa, and the Fat Man allowed him to resign.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state firms.
They also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
However, according to the court, they were wrongfully compensated for almost 2 million crowns.
The fat man now performs as a witness in the case, following the Supreme Court's intervention.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and addresses civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful (he solves criminal matters - red.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another Prague judicial district.
The king has twice acquitted Jana Nečas, formerly Nagy.
It was alleged abuse of military intelligence to track Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
In this case, the Fat Man didn't figure.
According to Jaroslav Ortman's lawyer, however, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted as such in order to rule out court if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to be judged after that, he noted for the diary.
"It seems crazy to me," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged in the political news market case.
According to his attorney Petr Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 discussed the indictment of former cabinet chief Prime Minister Petr Nečas Jana Nagy (today Nečasová) and others in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová and her husband come to trial.
The fat lady was supposed to deal with statements about Peroutek.
For example, the wife of the ambassador was to judge President Miloš Zeman's statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutek.
Zeman declared him sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria along with her two equally old friends last February from London Gatwick Airport.
The British Interior Ministry did not comment on the report of her death.
The young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly taken to Syria through the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana, according to the media, headed to their other former classmate from the London School of Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year caused a huge wave of attention and also tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that some 600 British Muslims have so far traveled to Syria, including about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A hundred-thousand-pay dream job.
A well paid job you don't even need college for.
That's what an I.T. guy looks like.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only on Czech conditions of extremely high salary (you earn up to CZK 180 000 in IT in Prague), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the staff agency Grafton, the most wanted are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Thus, she does not compete with candidates for a job position, but with job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
College education is not a necessity for IT students.
College education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and educationality, but often does not have much in common with knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which once a graduate college will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He earns most in Prague.
I.T. payrolls all over the place are high above the Republican average.
The most money they will find in Prague and Brno, it is no longer such a hit parade in the regions.
"Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague," Kubačka confirms.
The top profit will be achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also required.
On arrival, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
The fight is for alumni.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, IT doesn't apply.
If companies overwhelm and overpay an expert from another company, they like to reach for a graduate.
Because they can raise him their own way.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but it is necessary for IT students to have at least decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking especially for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied with only average knowledge of English.
For example, if a support worker has more foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he adds Kubačka.
Yeah, in Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly envied can Czech workers work for Google employees.
Of course, they have flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various abbreviated jobs, not only for mothers.
"The company provides new dads with four weeks extra leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Jonek, Google spokesman.
The pampering also involves health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages in the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn is green and no matter what new he wants to learn.
But that's not the end of the bargain.
Such a full refrigerator is certainly not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all offices, where people always find healthy snacks, they reveal a spokesman.
And in order for nothing to be thrown out, what doesn't eat is put in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these incredible advantages in the Czech Republic?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or development, ideas and innovative solutions," he adds.
The UN has sharply criticised Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "invokes serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law", warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to witness the importance and influence of public figures expressing public support for criminal armed combats that brazenly hold hunts for refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid emphasized.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - a quest for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer spending their free time over screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally reduced to television, later to video games, and most recently to smartphones.
It's great to see that outside technology and activities don't rule each other out.
Of course, I'm talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decrease in interest before the launch of this new game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The listing in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter does.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out looking for Pokémon that are tracking using GPS, and when they find them, they can ‘photo 'em' (via screenshot on the phone) or 'catch' them.
Mania seized a generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it from the seats and driving out looking for Pokémon.
Thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person takes every day.
The Cardiogram app for Apple's smart watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people trained every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go plays - only sees rough data about exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to “find 30”, “get off the couch” and “have been active every day” fell on barren soil, as most of the public health messages are boring and addressed to people who do not look good.
Yet the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot list here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something that entertains them.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some even make new friends in their pursuit of pokémon.
As is the case, of course, there are boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can come in the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn't give us any reason to do anything like this game.
News flashes, and interest in it begins to fade at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in the multi-fight of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic to jump.
No effort on the beam.
By the plains, they were all speechless.
Excellent at everything.
And now finally, the Olympic champion.
Nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday to the title in the multi-fight and overcame the others on a full line under the Olympic spotlights.
The 62.198 overall result clearly confirmed her lead over the silver medalist and team member of the "final fives" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance on the beam in the individual multi-fight final in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the multi-fight, and fifth overall when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey until now ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of rare athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold ones. Her stunning line-ups are a mixture of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she has ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between her alone and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as disappointing.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hugs after winning the gold and silver medals in the women's singles multi-fight final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was like an exclamation point in the celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the summit, which is not entirely true.
Part of her routine in simple - the one that contains a typical triple flip with double turn - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multi-fight competition has not lost since summer 2013 - this is a succession of wins that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina took the lead briefly thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
Hammers and plains - where Biles advocates the world championship - await.
She got back in the lead with 15.433 points per beam - and finished with 15.933 points in plain.
Raisman gently hugged her as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white and blue shadows, Biles appeared tears when she fulfilled the wishes she had once written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third rung with Mustafin, but then she eats bronze due to the sum of the three best routines.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of a team called "Grandma" by the Americans was way ahead.
After her plains, she sent air kisses to a crowd, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where she became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women died and a girl 12 years old during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot dead in a car parked in the driveway on June 12.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight shots from the handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, it's not worth a triple robbery murder because the attacker didn't take the wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one adult victim had on her.
Police spokesman in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks occurred within four months, in which seven people were killed and two others were injured.
"This is happening in the villa district in front of the houses", Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO station CBS branch.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a black BMW from late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to a hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died on the scene.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was targeted by an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder, which police believe was the source of the serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and built a bullet from the bullet residue in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephalia: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephalia, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I first thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are prepared for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people don't do that anymore", Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit or grovel, and he still doesn't talk.
Some milestones are already slowly filling.
He's dating and riding a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth performs sign language, using which Edmund says "please sing to me".
"We teach him sign language", said Picciutová for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly may arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as is the case with Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary substantially.
It's too early to tell what the Zika virus will have to do with the lives of the infected.
Picciut commemorates the emotional toll that the uncertain future takes.
I keep asking, “What happens next? ”
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the general prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me.
Picciutová, however, has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi would spill from their shores and threaten widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and assistance is already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson for the Governor's Office for Homeland Security and emergency preparedness said they were receiving vehicle applications for water rides, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only the Tangipaho district asked for 10,000 sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain working in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service stated in a statement that it could rain more than 8 to 13 centimerts over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on standby on Friday, when the rains continued in the Mobile area.
According to the forecast, the Comite Rivers near Baton Rouge and Amite near Denham Springs are to culminate on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said they both said they could flood a number of houses in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that floods downstream in the Ascension district were a danger, when these floods would only slowly be poured into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, a little further south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded levels on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescuers are still picking up people from torrential waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among the rescued at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said his other stepson, who lives nearby, alerted him.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it all the way to my waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she's ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford stated that crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to the Gloster fire station, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that, with the continuation of heavy rains, floods are “suddenly spreading” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimetres of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities reported that heavy rain and paid trips required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
The WWL station branch of CBS announced that 200 homes were flooded according to the old man from Tangipahoa.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The town mayor Robby Miller stated that authorities rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that high water imprisoned.
shelters were established in the municipality of Amite and the town of Hammond for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, over 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and local residents were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"We had the last major floods here in March," the city administrator Lacy Landrum said.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in Harrison, Mississippi, said that persistent rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said a couple of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot to death like a wringer", survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it's the second shooting of a child 6 years of age in the city.
Child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including weaknesses, legs, arms, and abdomen, but was conscious during transport to the hospital.
"He took too much, his little body was shot through like a ratchet," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, to the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and underwent several surgeries.
The family said for the station that the boy should recover.
He was supposed to be in primary school first class.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown section.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men aged 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia there are two other victims in stable condition.
According to station reports, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia reported that there was probably a shootout between several armed men.
Bullets from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault-type weapons were found at the scene.
Apparently, this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
It therefore appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," said the station captain of the Philadelphia Police Anthony Ginaldi.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one's been detained, and the police are reported to be investigating video footage from cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm with a stray bullet on Tuesday outside the home of West Oak Lane.
The girl's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I picture the women's gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games for several reasons.
First of all, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And two, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish descent, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black women and Latin American women at the top of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been African American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second runs last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic Games champion, and America rejoiced.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world winners Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, who demonstrated unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the female multi-fight of individuals.
And team member Aly Raisman got the silver.
We're witnessing a sports peak, but in gymnastics class in the country, it doesn't look like it.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnast team for the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the final year Marta Karolyi trains.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport, and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnast clubs, which keep parents paying the costs of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is an expensive and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, both trained athletes at the time they began gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or at low cost in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially from black and Hispanic origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, achievements at school and at work.
It's the inspiration this team will send to us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison, for proving "girl strength" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be an end to disagreements over changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed in July plans to enforce the contract with NHS being in "nobody's land" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend working procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
In a statement last night, physician Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Young Physicians, stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and thus fair treatment of all doctors. ”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under the new treaty, progress is needed and time is running out.
The efforts of the BMA to resolve disputes through negotiations met with the unwillingness to involve Dr and often with deafening silence from the government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement and resolve the concerns of young physicians".
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that following the conclusion of the revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements would be concluded regarding changes.
BMA wants higher work payments for the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Chairman of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any strike.
Mortimer said: “Only a little or nothing will be achieved by choosing an action, but pressure will be placed on already overloaded teams and services, and fears, exhaustion and disruptions will increase for patients, treating staff and their families will increase."
Over the past two months, we have been dealing with the Board of Young Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as busyness, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs about 60 crowns (two pounds) in conversion. Authorities recommend that more patients take it for a longer period of time.
The blood clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of relapse in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after having had a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that people be given the medicine for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat that forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is separated, blood clots may occur, blocking the access of the blood to the heart, and developing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another seizure.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the business name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely.
The proposal for a NICE directive published today recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Review Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of those who have had a heart attack and who suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences. ”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased to see that, on the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - over three years is limited, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas
The Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was suspended from office last year due to corruption, which was linked to the government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, as reported today in the government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles harshly criticizes the police, electoral inspectors, and city hall for ignoring electoral abuse because of "the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that the intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that police should make cordons from the polls and keep the voters out of sight.
He recommended that voters take with them an ID document and can prove who they are at the election.
At the moment, the voters just need to state their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes applying indelible ink on the fingers of people when giving their voices in order to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
He requests that the press be given greater access to documents from meetings and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not just about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from a wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled, incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be recalled from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically intervened" by the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms by charges of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, “led his campaign so as to be a religious duty to dedicated Muslims to vote for him. ”
Up to 300 votes have been challenged or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives himself up to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about fraud in a correspondence vote - which is claimed to have been exerted by older members of the Muslim community during it to pressure people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, on the photo, gave several recommendations on how to clear the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: “There has been evidence that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
"There was a concern that... state institutions were closing their eyes to such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including preventing political activists from tampering with correspondence votes and thus preventing "the extraction of votes."
The report, now assessed by Theresa May, also asks for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of election lists for immigration fraud and batch fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present a proof of identity before voting.
Using indelible ink on people's fingers in voting to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Disable political agitators and activists from tampering with surrendered correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the polls.
Change laws to make it easier to prosecute persons exerting illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Forbidden taking photos in the polls.
Require only English (except Wales) to work in polling rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to voting booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"Election issues trial ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices", he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless "checking of checkboxes" in the electorate registration departments at the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s decision of the Court in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some institutions threaten this reputation.
Infatuation by cycling doppelganger Kate and other doppelgangers of well-known personalities at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio went crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is even strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold athlete this year to boast her own double of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities currently appearing on our screens, the columns for women FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As hunted animals: A member of the U.S. archer team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared since he was a little boy to Leonard DiCaprio
Alongside Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from the team of U.S. archers Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his images emerged on which he strikingly resembles a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarity to Leo since he was a little boy.
"He himself sees no great resemblance, except perhaps beards," said Brady for the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: a striking resemblance between British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for several years to the star of the series Gell Matthew Morrison.
And for a change: User thinks Nathan with an "athletic version" of the film Beginning (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud of not only the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord, and of Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team fans say she looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Able Women: Hope Sol's Star of Football (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter's actress (right) have a similar face and eye shape
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarity
On Waves Theory: According to this user there may be a reason behind similar pair appearances
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the website that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are truly identical."
Football star Hope Sol and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a truly incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medal holder for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which as if copying Gabrielle Union's smile, the stars of Bravo, girls!
The CBC Olympic Games commentator apologizes for saying about the Chinese swimmer that she "exploded"
Wednesday's live broadcasters from the Olympic Games at CBC were outraged by the performance analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's commentator Byron MacDonald.
Canada's CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "drawn like a stink" and "exploded".
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the women's 4x200 meter relay final, he began spouting his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was to bring “resurrection ” to the CBC commentators team, stated among other things:“ The little 14 - year - old from China gave up, you fool. ”
Too excited, dragged like a stink, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in time 1:57.79 - i.e. 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to drag China.
Viewers in Canada began to quickly speak online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC announcer say that a 14 - year - old swimmer from China “exploded? ”???
That idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China in the finals of the women's relay race at 4x200 metres freestyle was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticisms came on Twitter from all sides, and many demanded his appeal.
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they did not hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said: "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped to air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC station eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commenter Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonalda
CBC then copied and put their apology into response for over 90 Twitter users who complained to commentator MacDonald
The station also apologized quickly and published a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, should not have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments concerned the performance of a swimmer, not a swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live air and attempted to explain his comment by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the air from the Olympics at CBC station.
"I meant the performance of a swimmer and not a person of a swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say I didn't intend any disrespect and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark outraged by a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman took off her clothes to try on her panties on the sales surface in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were not sure which direction to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, took her panties off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and eventually tried four pairs of panties at the shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Flokestone.
Primark store at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that a mysterious woman, after trying out her underwear, “redressed and came out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, cheeky as a monkey."
"Everybody just stared at her taking her panties off again, and apparently she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, re-dressed and left.
"She didn't seem to mind at all who was watching - nor did she think of the person who might have bought the panties she was trying."
Miss Davidson (33) who lives in Kent said: “The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else was wearing and no one cleaned them.
The event occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that she evidently tried to pull off the sale - which is also the only thing right. ”
"I would be terrified to bring home new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, took them off and that they weren't washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9. ”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend yourself against weapons attack using Krav Maga
The outside world is dangerous, but with this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City to see how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly win over the rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If they approach you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a clear shot path".
You then grab a gun between your forearm and your shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a loose elbow.
Then the knee follows into the weak, and while the attacker wriggles in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit the main in the face and start retreating, holding the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it is similar technique - get your body off the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put force into the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from its grip and start retreating while still aiming at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video, where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get out of an ambush - if you're not the Grandmaster of Krav Maga - is to give out all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to subject his immune system to a severe test and a gag reflex - by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and author of travel magazines Ian Wright (51), native to Suffolk, to prove the strength of his immune system he licked his tongue with a Euro banknote, railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush on the toilet on the train and a Russian public phone.
He used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flusher button on a train used by thousands of other people may seem utterly repugnant, however, there is in fact much more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health specialists about strengthening the bacteria of intestinal flora and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left in his mouth worse than an aftertaste.
Ian Wright became famous by testing the resistance of his intestines on travel around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public railings at train stations to flusher
In a film about it, he says: “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a kid, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to worm eating and mud water. ”
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
All he refused were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a traveling film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria at different locations, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said: “This is almost the most disgusting thing I have ever felt in a toilet. ”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices, and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the passion and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in bowel health becomes a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in broader contexts - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how this is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I wanted him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we did some of the dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria primarily to stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents stated that they at least occasionally used products containing added lactic acid.
The family of socially needed before eviction destroyed the municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of socially needed left £50,000 in damage to its municipal home after being charged with terrorizing its neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, apartment squad officials were shocked to discover that the property was in an emergency state.
There were holes in the walls, floor coverings were torn, garbage was lying all over the floor, and walls were scrawled.
The family has already moved away and is believed to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, the housing director at Cornwall Housing said she was worried about whether she was going to save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
There are a number of circumstances that need to be considered, because this property is likely to become known as the "not so nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple has three sons who have occasionally resided in the house, and police have stated that the terror of the family involved street fighting using baseball bats, intimidating surrounding residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screaming, fighting and swearing.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease contract, was awarded a penalty for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, stinking garbage was found.
In a house where drugs were distributed in the past, there was torn floor coverings
Neighbors say they saw them on the street fighting, and people called the police here on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after receiving an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved were greeted with their lives being a living hell.
One of them said: “They didn’t care about anyone at all. ”
We lived next door for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
As many times as we've seen the police here, there's no counting.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor in Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, reported that the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, police were regularly summoned to the house
Garbage and old toys lay in the overgrown part of the village house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept responsibility for her own conduct and for the conduct of her family. Eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope that this move will bring some comfort to the neighbours and at the same time convey the message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenants' sons who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
A polluted mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after eviction
The workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage left around the house
In 2014, she made shelves in the house raiding and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth after eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they're going to try to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease agreements.
Angela Crow of Denov and Cornwall Police said the eviction was by sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened after a low-flying military jet plane over the beach
Tourists enjoying the sun's rays in Portuguese Aveir were terrified to death
The Portuguese Air Force Air Force Air Force P-3C flew over to incredibly low
The military air force stated it was a training flight, insisting that safety was not compromised.
As the low-flying jet drifted over a crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic shots show how a military aircraft reaches a distance almost to the touch of the sun people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet aircraft engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted video recordings of a dramatic crossover on social networks, said: “The plane flew twice really low, and at one point it seemed to collapse. ”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were horrified when a low-flying aircraft appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Army Air Force stated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight in order to identify a fishing ship off the coast and had to endure low as it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the air force insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four casualties on the lives of Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boat as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services do not most often inform the survivors of their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The ČOI imposed 41 fines for the total value of CZK 73,000.
Her spokesperson Jiří Fröhlich informed about this today.
Inspectors found fault with 47 of the 95 controls.
In addition to non-information on prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This involved urn packaging, candle covers and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"As there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in the Syrian Race a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced Thursday that it was probably killed during a Russian airstrike in Racca, which is a bastion of a group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family she died just as she was preparing to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others, that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that they will discourage people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the eastern part of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and had widowed within a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a High Court candidate.
The Senate leader for the Democratic Party Harry Reid says she believes that the candidate for the presidential election for the Democrats Hillary Clinton nominates Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, although President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the late Supreme Court judge will elect the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid stated that she believed that Clinton would pick Garland “with some degree of credibility.”
Reid's spokesman later stated that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he only speculated.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "shake the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is Chairman of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said that Republicans blocking Garland's appointment were "servants" and "minions" of the Republican candidate for Donald Trump's presidency.
He said Trump wasn't good for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for "women and men"
Magazine Treats works closely with photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of revealing well-known personalities, NU Muses is trying to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier that year that his nude magazine differs from the Old School Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We must go back to depicting timeless and classical nudity, when women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of a woman's body," Shaw said in a press statement to release a calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who actually buys record records?
Vinyl is loved by middle-aged single men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comment section with perky notes under the pseudonym Not All Lone MenIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, so many discussed resurrections of record records are linked not to the boom of milliennials who want to enjoy the originality of ownership of a physical object, but to middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people 18-24 are the least likely.
It is not really about massing an enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy record records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were aired as a television report, the camera would watch me head off to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesticulating widely. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look.
While Soho is slowly disappearing from the heart of his charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, hotels, restaurants and canteens, confection and office supplies are now filled - several fantastic specialist shops with record records remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and is looking at shops to fill out several hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got, like, 3,000 or 4,000 recordings.
All the recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he e-mailed me the photo, I didn't follow it all the way home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he buys again what he sold when he was young and he didn't have a penny.
"Many of what I buy is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12, when I was too small and couldn't get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are likely introverts who like the company of themselves, adding: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old record records back.
According to my interviews, people were getting rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record records and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy their record records back," he says.
This could explain the boom of gramophone record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of record records?
It will not take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you will find a pleasant association of people with similar thinking in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some gramophone record fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of record record covers, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, that's the case with me, and I think a lot of people are, too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" the collaborator calls from a stack of record records.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of the phonographs questioned are never used, while 7% of those who buy phonograph records do not have phonographs.
At this point in the story, he probably seemed really concerned about going through a pile of brassa nova compilations.
The aspect of “trophies” and the revival of interest is something Jonny (42) noticed working at the Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came in and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy it on the Radiohead board so we can display it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than it is about music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a tape recorder."
These are younger people, not the older ones, the grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for record records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There's a couple of 70-year-olds, tourists who take pictures, teenagers, and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops before - the speakers instead of pulling jazz echo the latest Wild Beasts pop full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but you can't guess the intrusive mental trauma when you've been standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) takes several minutes in Fopp walking through and viewing various record records at a discount.
She's one of those who's more likely to look at the windows than to spend a feverish amount of money.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so there's no way she collects record records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone records have their charms... "He sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that allegedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls flocking around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's gramophone records: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of record records.
No one looks at them - perhaps precisely because they are only for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's a purely "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to Soho's depths for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area where there is more time and money than in other areas is also the one where it spends the most on the most luxurious goods, which vinyl certainly is.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov appear to be accurate - at least in record stores, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and lovers of vinyl who actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around shops with record records on Berwick Street, going through recordings and avoiding looking at a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV host who hides behind the back of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - videojournalism
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five metres
The court in France refused to tear down shops in the jungle refugee camp
The court in France denied the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift stores where people inside the camp sell goods, ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cuttings, in makeshift restaurants selling tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The Prefect Office in Calais argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations at the court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups do not provide an addendum to food for growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Controversy interim shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 makeshift deals, but stated that the objections of Prefect Calais were “completely understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes, and restaurants have a much greater role than simply serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said that spaces provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the camp cafe, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a nonprofit organization, offering 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of endangered minors unaccompanied in the camp.
Over 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the “child” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the cafe would “be a disaster for these children, some of them only 8 years. ”
Charity organizations Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the numbers of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer rose to over 9,000 - which is the most in the past ever.
He thought he was dead.
Ulcz resurrects himself and the volleyball mouth.
"Since March I could train normally," he reported at the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What was wrong with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when the weather is working or changing.
But nothing that limits me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
I did.
Last year at the Summer Tournament in Woodens, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was completely exhausted for five more days.
I really thought in Wooden House I was dead, my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some blood issues, I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
Only when I wanted to get back to the Příbrami preparation last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock, physically I'm better off than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm looking forward to it, the gang looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about two more strangers coming.
Let's hope we sit down humanely so we can fit together.
Can you lift the mouth?
He had a reputation for beating up, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now it's second.
There's a new team in Ústí. There's only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extra league, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
Once we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see who gets beat up after the first rounds, we won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's experienced a lot, he'll think better than the last place.
But my coming here wasn't related to him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I'm a big friend and it was agreed to operate here.
I'm not gonna say a name.
In the end, Mr Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to tease, and I like to get an opportunity on a not-so-high team.
I've been in Příbrami for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a foreigner, he's already coaching Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And we talked there a couple of times, sometimes we sat together after the games, so we know each other friendly.
We beat them at 3:1, I poured it on the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a charmer.
An American Nadazdin and a Brazilian Ze are still arriving.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting with an American, he seems like a good kid, Brazilian, who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm the taper, the one who makes it, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately looked up who the players were, I looked up on the Internet playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We posted a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'd fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to being the number one record player?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm twenty-four and I don't have the temper to take turns.
I'd rather be at the center of the action, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I were to be like the second taper and do it all the time. When something's not done to the full, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Six months in Příbrami, when it didn't work out for Kust as captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems, and he left.
We've been up since then, and I've played all the time.
In Brno, whose offspring I was, I changed the number one and the number two.
Great year was in Old Town, I had a lot of offers after him and I chose Příbram.
Budejovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short positioning device remains the Phelps domain.
"Being back on the podiums and hearing the anthem is sweet as ever," laughed Phelps while his eyes were full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother cheered again in the audience, son Boomer this time slept peacefully with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming in a race, and in a few hours, it'll all be over, he said touched.
In the final behind Phelps by almost two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long positioning machine.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (long distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete who mastered the same discipline at four games in a row.
For most of the race, another American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira were led by Phelps.
While the gold defender in the final Kraularian 50 put on a crushing finish, they fell out of medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the positioning position, he advanced to the final of the race for 100 meters of bow tie.
Even the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the signing double, could not overshadow the legend - he won the double track in Rio after a hundred.
In the final, he left behind 37 hundredths of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, third finished Russian Yevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy only has a fifth place out of the 200th World Cup last year, he became sign king in Rio.
He took Larkin from the imaginary throne, who had the same double at last year's world championship.
But he won the medal at the Olympics only now.
On the crayon's hundred, Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuel's second after silver from the relay.
She won swimming gold on OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, said touched Manuel.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-metre butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the two-hundred crayons.
Until the sixth World Recordman Australian Cate Campbell finished.
The two-hundred breastplate was won by Japanese Rie Kanet, for whom it was the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
It has no valuable metal or from the World Championships, its maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was acquired by Russia's Julija Jefimov, who, due to the start of the games despite the doping past, is struggling with the hostility of the spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
I'm so tired of it, she said Russian swimmer.
The right to launch in Rio was claimed only at the special panel of the sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't like it, or if he has a different opinion, let him turn to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
Czechs had a special day.
Only less than an hour before the match, they learned who they were going to fight.
They must have mastered tactical preparation in a flash.
And then, in an unusual time, they started a match on a small court number one.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the lead of the rivals, but in the condition of 19:19 they did not manage the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and leveled, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
Above all, a number of broken service meant a 10:15 loss and goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start, before I got started, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, I missed the reception I had gotten used to before.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
In the next set we started on them with an overview on the field, a different defense and pushed on the service.
There's been a really bad serve in the tie-break, and that's where we took this side down.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
Sluková: Too bad the beginning of the first set, that's where we missed it.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the spikes.
The second set was great, and in the third, he decided the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and by the five, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on little yard number one?
Sluková: Similar to China in the side courtyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, all quiet, the music didn't play, nothing.
That was different from downtown.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the contestants an hour before the match?
She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opposing games, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like the other teams.
But Simon (the Nausch coach) prepared tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of papers prepared with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
- I don't think so.
We played at 10:30, but not 12.
Ruska Birlov's block in the pre-round playoffs at OH, Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in the pre-round playoffs at the OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since 10, we had a mode shifted earlier.
That was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to serve their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we did the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not really typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the advance from the group was our goal, on the one hand it's okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I'll sleep it off and from tomorrow I'll only remember positively at the Olympic tournament.
Big Brother's here, here comes the first snooping SIM.
You can't escape it.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM from one of the local operators when staying in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or marry there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunication Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunication regulator in early August.
The new measures to enable their location to be monitored are intended to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow foreign crime to be solved.
The so-called tourist SIMs are also intended to help detect persons who exceed the permitted length of stay.
A special SIM for foreigners should appear at the side of the SIM designated exclusively for Thais within six months.
The difference will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently switched on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This SIM feature is not for Thais, because we can always easily track them," added Tantasith.
It must be added that in Thailand prepaids are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller shall require proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators handed out a free start SIM to tourists at airports.
They were so completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore.
They also currently have mandatory SIM registrations, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not mean an obligation for foreigners to purchase a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of that country only know relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after signing in the SIM to their network.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so vast that even most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand have legally received immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, compares the planned system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, police will need a court order if necessary to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be subject to an unspecified penalty.
"If the service provider monitors the SIM location without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," added Tantasith.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While a particular number is currently recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not sign up to the network, the number could be renewed after 15 days in case of leaving Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property's care would be provided by the caretaker.
The condition was enough parking space and elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking floors, high energy intensity and so on.
Large terraces were also a condition, which the old building is unable to offer.
More interesting visitors can be found in Modern Apartment magazine.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he designs the apartment from the beginning, because this is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to match the interior accordingly based on the client's wishes.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous socio-residential space with adequate background for a four-member family conceived as a modern but not cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment to the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of the design had to be monitored.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you yourself interfere in the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs including technical drawings and material samples, however, the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from design and showed some interior elements that we would like to include in the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mostly Czech authors including the works of Karl Malich, Karl Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund who helped the architect orientate ourselves in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.
Were there any complications in the implementation of which you had to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, to agree to new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was possible to ascend to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we planned were actually shielding the surrounding buildings.
That's when we literally changed the layout overnight.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, such as upholstery of dining and bar chairs Norma by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes, or is there something you wish you had today differently?
I believe it is a modern air interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not going to change, most of the modifications after moving took place in the plane of shading and settling terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when the walnut wood appears to be too delicate for a household with a dog.
The word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, therefore it was possible to make completely new layouts and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior is an important element of placing sun tunnels in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight in the darker spaces of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the rooftop terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building adaptations that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
The swimming pool and hot tub are also included.
Compared to the French, you're not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are native to Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just outside the Spanish border.
I've moved around a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon, and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which gave me a job in a magazine.
Then why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel asphyxiated in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was so negative.
The people in France are negatively tuned in general, but it's gotten even worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
Some people evaluate Czech nature in this way.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France, because they don’t feel that much about it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big issue.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is EUR fifteen hundred, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I was Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work practically anywhere else, and I ran into an opening at Air France right here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know Prague at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't capture any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel like people are more free.
That I could do anything, dress in any way, and no one would judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable looking at you, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
I don't think the Prague people care about that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
After that, my friend and I established a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
So far, we are only active in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from half, and two other Czech friends.
I must say that the other specific thing about Czechs is that they initially keep more distance.
They won't let anyone near the body.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it's easy enough in Prague because everyone here speaks English.
Even in curfews or in foods.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by everyone's ability to communicate in English at least a little bit, I don't have the need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps this is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
I can think of one experience.
My manager, the Czechs, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They're not French, they're Africans.
That kind of touched me.
But that someone would have a problem with me being Muslim, that's never happened to me before.
Even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown and get yelled at.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid, for example, that something similar like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, these days, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, perhaps I could not imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognise violence at all.
To me, people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Quran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists defending themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the violence reports, but every time I read something, I feel like I need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří of Poděbrady Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But the way I see it, these people feel the need to prove they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my fellow workers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, they might have learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with a woman's subordinate position.
How do you feel about that?
I don't feel subordinate in any way.
More like the other way around.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It also has to do with the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
Like a hijab?
And the way I was raised is mainly signed on it.
For example, my mother is a true Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal matter.
It depends on everyone how they interpret it.
When one reads the Koran, one should make an opinion of those things.
So when I read a passage in the Quran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from others, I said to myself, I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves are required, I will take it.
Do you plan to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else felt so good.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
I think Prague is an ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Sailor Kozelská Fenclová's wind in Rio rolled on the advance partitions.
Friday's trips at sea in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were released by Czech yachter Veronica Kozelské Fenclová.
In Laser Radial class, it moved to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure that the Czech Republic participates in the final race.
You collect packages like pokémon.
They want to compete with the transporters.
The idea of using already planned routes for transport of parcels is based on television director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life into three applications with different geographic ranges.
We launched the national app in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities in it, and we're going to expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first before we focus more on foreign countries, says in an interview for iDNES.cz, a 41-year-old manager.
How do I transfer apps work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and how much package you can transport and how much you want.
Maybe someone's asking for transport on that day again.
When the route and time of delivery are convenient, it is paired up and both receive mutual notification.
That's when the cabin opens, where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find their courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't guess how many registered and how many routes it takes to make the coverage absolutely optimal and each offer paired with demand.
It's already working on the main moves, and it's logically easier than on the road between the villages.
The more people, the more speed and precision potential.
People are also building up confidence and discovering that no one escapes with a package.
You haven't had to solve a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have after two months of launch?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6,000 people making the roads.
We consider this a success, and we believe that more will be packed.
Is there any chance that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be competitive for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing the same day and at a fraction of the price.
You'll pay several thousand for delivery to a large company within two hours.
You'll pay a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing it.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope that's the case.
The market has huge potential, there are huge multinational carriers feeding here, as well as trade chains where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality is not what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox with a note saying to pick up the package at the branch, first the day after 7:00 p.m.
By that time, I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not annoy anyone and send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
None of them have ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as manager of the music club, Matěj Liška as television director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned travel between world metropolises, especially aircraft, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company, which created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
Programming lasted three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The application Transport started to develop in December last year and released this May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The application was developed by Mesík and Mesík Profi as of this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications, which one day will merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a theme lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Aren't you worried about working in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the sharing boundary and where is the gray economy?
It's the same, just a different product.
It's clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we'll be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to circumvent the financial authorities and tax controls.
Every user, either on the one hand or on the other, will be urged to tax his income if he makes his income out of it.
What makes you think the service has so much potential?
The sender saves and the ferryman earns, respectively, reducing the cost of the journey.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In a time of social networking that divides people, we would like to see this one converge.
There can be nice stories, people are happy to help someone and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have long lacked a personal approach, we say that this app is a service to people.
Then how do you guarantee that the courier with the package won't escape?
Each application user will scan the ID together with registration and state the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give both the service and the person credibility.
The couriers also collect stars based on the evaluation of senders.
We'll offer insurance, we'll match the details.
A courier is liable for an uninsured shipment in the event of loss or damage, but does not assume responsibility for content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hash in a sealed package in his trunk, the criminal liability will be charged to the sender.
Is there a threat of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, a traceable administrative body that will be the only one able to see it, nor are we ourselves able to see it, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery of the shipment?
The courier determines the price and gets the whole amount he asks for.
The sender shall be charged several percent extra to facilitate contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push on volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when he actually delivered it, receiving and delivering it is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can move anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plateau of eggs, and big as a bass of beer.
After that, there's no more restrictions, and if anyone has a seat in the car, they can move the fridge.
Plus, the sender has a chance to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what's being asked.
You don't even have to pack if you don't want to hide the contents.
You stick a forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
My friend had an idea more than two years ago, and I wasn't paying much attention to it back then.
Then he showed me demo apps with transnational range, which target mainly passengers by plane.
That's when I told him I wouldn't look for an investor, but I'd like to become an investor myself and put my savings into it.
Another year of development took us to establish Shippansee LTD in London because of the greater creditworthiness of the entire product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to improve the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and we are not dealing with the foreign market so much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we're in no hurry, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgraded.
I will move it when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we will at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Mesek is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as I will, but the difference is that as a courier, you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your phone.
An app for couriers who want to do that for a living, we called "Profi's Mesa".
So someone can make a lot of money by picking up packages all over town?
Exactly, the last app is downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
Now that everyone's fooling around with these pokémon, they can collect this exactly the same way.
One sees where there are orders around the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transports the shipment.
It is set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are still making a web interface that will be crucial for the mailing companies, which will fill in the data on the website, so it will create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice their use of the service every month.
Are you now engaged in a full-time project?
It makes us hard, but we normally have it at work so that we can support and develop the project.
There is not a strong multinational investor behind us, we are two boys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other stimuli and ideas.
Now, we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage to manage not the Czech market with us, but who should, with the pardon of the ball, go with us to a worldwide product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story section of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten diversity.
This will fix the second episode and the solo game will be more varied than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is based on the concept of network wrestling in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using a battle titan.
In addition to action passages, the game will contain levels focused on skillful movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, running on walls and rope slides are essential to overcoming them.
Sometimes it will also be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will be no maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to lift platforms and close massive doors.
You will adjust the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should thus oscillate between ferocious action and calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We'll play as pawn Jack Cooper, dreaming of a career as a pilot.
Cooper, at the start of the campaign, along with Captain Lastimos, is shipwrecked on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilderness will not be lenient to him.
In addition, Lastimosa will suffer fatal wounds in the crash, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with making the captain's titan operational.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper and Titan's calls will be significant.
It will serve players as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time robot depersonal communications will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium is dry, it lists all the injuries that Cooper is facing in the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign at Titanfall 2 was brought by the Polygon server.
In addition, it will be possible to assess the result in two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions of the network game after Gamesco.
Titanfall 2 comes out on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company in 2013.
Nordic, for example, released Darksiders 2 Deathhnitive Edition or Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, another 23 games are created for the label and 13 of them have not yet been discovered by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time of my retirement, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a 20 - year - old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - she was obviously trying for a long time, then they got together.
She's such a big guy, probably her type, 'cause she dated a similar guy before me.
She's totally into him.
On those first days, her voice even changed, she had this girl's, love's voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching the whole thing.
He was a regular at work at 3:30, so she always went shopping at 3.
Every day, she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there.
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end, I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, make that decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me mentally.
Soon, I think she found out that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted me to do.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a slipper.
At the time, my neighbors were telling me that they knew about it.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all burst, it'd be bad.
The only thing that would happen in the family was the daughter.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But once I went to his apartment to see if there was anything I needed help with in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him I got an anonymous tip, that he was seeing my wife, and that everything suggested it.
I asked him what he'd say.
He stood there, shriveled his shoulders, looked down and didn't say a word.
Then, too, at that time, I met his wife on my way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never been anywhere much, who's having trouble getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I wasn't even thinking about divorce.
I always relied on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this, and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never really dealt with it all.
I still have it in me to this day.
I used to show it to her a lot, but in the end, I stopped.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housekeeper.
At home, she always did everything - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's a hard worker.
I always thought she was trying to keep me from having any other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to pet her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that he still loves him. He's her god.
And I don't enjoy that kind of life.
Even then, when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her I didn't want to live, and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted her to say: yes or no.
But she thought about it, and she finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
Following terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists, and the government and local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who undermine public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that in the country only the spiritual educated in France preach.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where the preachers often come with the money vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already supposed to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, internal contradictions struck her, and she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
At the head of the new foundation, the former Minister of Interior and Defense Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a proponent of the secular state, will apparently become the head of the new foundation.
In France there are about 2500 mosques and prayers, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled roughly 80 Islamic clergymen from the country, and for several other tens they are considering this move.
This week, the German police also intervened against jihadist clergymen.
Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers reportedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate about a new institution was on fire in France to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the funding of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will get its finances, even though several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal foods, namely meat coming from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for granting permission.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who will go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them leave France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have passed educational programs at their universities should operate in the French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have closed twenty since December and more will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no room in France for those who proclaim hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in North Spanish Zaragoza, writes the daily Independent.
The shooting occurred after a woman and daughter left the garage space in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the shopping mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writing Independent.
An unharmed daughter took the woman to the hospital, an ambulance must have arrived for the men in critical condition.
The crime occurred around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous area of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Asparagus wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes light, well digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our appetites and our heads.
And so the summer gardens smell like grilled necks, briskets, pork pins.
Nothing very healthy, not very light, not so often except salad or baked vegetables.
True, barbecue is cost-effective for time and dishes, plus it's a social matter and no one has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to doing well with delicacies that special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to boil, bake, fry or choke anything.
And they're going to contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-adapted griffins will suffice to make the preparation fun and food itself an exotic delicacy.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here even passes out more time-consuming cooking and cooling rice.
The paper can only be softened into water for a moment and then it depends only on the chef's imagination, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
It's not an algae like an algae.
The advantage of a number of Asian dishes today is that raw materials are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, by which it mixes with several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
It is sufficient to buy a bag of appropriate size, and the attachment with demonstrable antibacterial effects, both supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is finished.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within various ceremonial occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed leaves of the banana tree are also very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America as a "help" to prepare various baked, cooked and fried dishes that are wrapped in them in a similar way to the foil.
The banana leaf then gives a specific flavor to the dish.
In our country they can be bought in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, select only leaves richly green and therefore healthy - uncracked and spotless.
Similarly, the preparation of a salad made of wakame algae, sesame and sesame oil is easy.
Because you can buy it frozen again.
He who often eats or prepares sushi will probably know especially the nori algae.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed from which it is produced by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves − that is, the plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame − A dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaidó Island − is also eaten fresh and dried and is as popular as a nori algae.
By the way, who wouldn't know miso soup with wakame, reportedly Asian women have been using it for recovery since birth.
And at all, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses blood, strengthens blood circulation, even reportedly prevents gray hair and is literally charged with mineral substances.
The dried and broken wakame also serves as a spice, for example, for the flavoring of rice.
Fresh algae are first let to leach in the water, then flushed, put into boiling water and cook for half a minute.
It is then cooled in ice water, cut out the centre rib and continue to adjust, for example as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all that remains is to twist the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bomb of longevity.
Unless you resist and throw in an extra grilled brisket.
To eat healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that deliciously combines tastes.
And it's done in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radishes, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g cucumbers, 60 g wakame algae, and 60 g sweet chili sauces.
A handful of meatloaf cilantro, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of Sriracha chili sauce, 20 g mangoes and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little bit of pine nuts.
Let's get the rolls ready first.
We'll dip rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we remove it and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, in hot water, we briefly boil asparagus sprouts, and after about three minutes, we quickly cool them into ice water so they don't lose color.
We put vegetable filling on the paper and pack it.
We prepare the filling with white radishes, carrots and cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and paste on rice paper.
Insert asparagus sprouts on the banana leaf, add rolls and finish the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, mango slice, sprinkle with black sesame and add some pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven rugby, Fiji's choice takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in the seven rugby ended in a devastating trail on the final obstacle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at a high 43:7.
The Fijians performed a master's lesson in processing, landfill, retreats, support game, line run and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unguarded consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third on a given day - and the British could have been proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven rugby, defeating New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa.
A hard-earned win over South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals that same day, she may have become frustrated in the finals.
But Fiji, in its form, would also defeat a 15-man team in full health.
Although it will not be any consolation for the British, they may rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former chief of England of Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the British penetrations reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a number of buses in motion and World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The time horizon showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added more after returning, and there was still more than 1 minute left in the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then penetrated through the malaise British and rushed to the line where he scored.
After conversion to 29:0, a break followed.
It was as if Fiji was born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning the passing.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes after halftime, and the Fijian strain stopped for four full minutes, which, compared to the first half, was good until after the brilliant interlude of Fiji Josua Tuisova, penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown into the left corner to raise an 36:7. The match was long won by the Pacific Islanders and their fans sang at the gallery, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyous attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Vilame sweetened another attempt to win the Fijians.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged and the British fell on the lawn completely sunk.
Before that same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semi-finals, and Great Britain defeated South Africa in the close semi-finals - by the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half to lead, but Dan Norton thanks to his dazzling footwork broke the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late landfill of Marcus Watson, Brother Anthony of the Fifteenth Team of England, secured a victory - and ultimately also a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race inspired coaching with cancer
You can't find any more emotional gold on these Games, and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exhales into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning at their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While two were sitting at the feast, there were three votes in the boat. When the boat was flying down the water to meet the second Olympic gold behind in a female pair race, there was still a voice with them in the boat still present by coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying down the water surface with the elegance of the swan - does not reflect the nature of victory entirely.
Behind every gold medal from rowing is a battalion of auxiliary hands that piece by piece means a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I had this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's gonna change your perspective.
Cancer was detected to Williams in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the whole trio was that he could start treatment in early 2014, off-season, thus shortening the blackout to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to pull myself together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet by the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to handle his own unrest.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a mission in Afghanistan, said: “This week I was at the bottom of my emotions, it may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it emphasizes how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked together, and so did Robin.
Until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's got a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better man for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair set on a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were concentrating at the most at the moment.
Helen screamed, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something amazing.
We weren't looking forward to fireworks today, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to think about it before they decide what happens next.
Glover's getting married next week, her future is television adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to find out I'm the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
This place took about four minutes.
I have a much better feeling about this," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let him drive people for free, says Cabmaf hunter Rubes to a groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former official of the City Hall in Prague are, as CT said, defendants.
You've made a series of reports in which you've exposed fraudulent practices and those to be in a group that's going to be court-martialed.
You faced some unpleasant clashes with the exposed actors because of this.
How much is the report on the prosecution of the members of the organized group a breakthrough for you?
I was expecting some kind of trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should be returned by carrying all the people for free.
This is a rather unique solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not see a possible punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes pingles, another delivers pizzas, and one completely bails on it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
I generally have a prison problem.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the companies they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they did what they did to destroy our country’s name and to steal from people.
So let them do a good business card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to pick up trash, they get a car, and they take people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole eventually, and they're not gonna care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently at the University of Tomáš Bata in Zlín.
They belong to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the website in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, now he is preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, these Rubes advise what services they prefer to avoid in Prague and which they recommend to use without fear.
He used to film series with names How to do it, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, A Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the prosecution, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent cabbies be described as mobsters?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Godfather.
It's more about mobsters - juniors, but they're definitely organized.
Just watching each other's relays.
Prague is completely divided.
I traced that, for example, the main station does not like being with Parisian, Parisian does not like being with taxi drivers waiting at Karl's Spa (disco club)
Everyone's just watching their little place, and every group is organized somehow.
It's probably a complex network.
But the defendants combined are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former Magistrate official who warned the driver of checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon did not disappear from the streets.
What percentage among Prague taxi impostors, according to your estimate, is involved?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryaček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - in his car he drives a telescopic baton, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and drives people.
Last time I rode with him, he wanted me for seven hundred for three kilometers.
For some reason, his police did not detain him.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
However, the same situation is also in other locations of Prague.
Thus, by the indictment of seven people, it is difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague vice, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it's no use.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists still perform in the same places you showed in the reports, at the Charles Bridge or in Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day and break the decrees every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
He's not a cat anymore, he's a total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, though only a part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and will always be for the center of Prague to improve.
And even if I feel like it needs to be a little bit better, I'm going to keep doing it.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't settle for that.
But it's not like that, of course, there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
I do test drives sometimes, and I have to say, it's still bad.
I just caught this cab driver last week, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although then claimed it was an amount of CZK 56 (he used a decimal trick).
He had a receipt for it, and the police arrived, and this cab driver was so cutely rude, he was still going to see the cops and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver taped the decimal point on the meter and robbed the tourists by 357 crowns.
Is it possible to say that the insolence of fraudulent taxi drivers did not give way even after you showed the faces of those who charged senseless sums for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
How did the taxi driver claim 56 crowns turn out?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And that would be, I think, a problem even in that court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
On the one hand, there'll be a cab driver with his receipts, on the other hand, the police.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court's decision, the Magistrate must not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in a court of law.
When I was filming parts about their scams, the cabbies themselves warned me about this precedent.
I'm the only one who's ever wanted to use the footage for the story.
Are you afraid that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope every judge understands that no cab driver could drive for six or ten kroner per kilometer because he wouldn't make a living.
You were talking about a decimal trick that underwater taxi drivers move in front of foreign clients.
Is this still up-to-date, or are they concerned about using this trick after publishing your reports?
I think we've popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I drove a cab driver recently, boasting in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard glued from the side of the meter.
When I asked him what it had in there, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If the fines didn't work on taxi drivers, can a trial with their colleagues do so?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You said they'd always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And those are fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there.
In my experience, I must say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague, fortunately, prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack an um.
He's not very good at it, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they held the demonstration (because of the proposal for a full-scale restriction coming from Mayor Adriana Krnáč's office), it didn't sound very clear what they wanted.
Once they said they didn't protest Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they claimed they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they only blocked Prague and made it the best commercial possible for Uber.
How do you evaluate the approach of Prague City Hall in solving the problem of overcharging fares?
It's obvious that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The Magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole who was leaking information, which means the taxi department had been doing its job for years completely for nothing.
I hope they charge this official to the last inspection of all the botched checks so he realizes what he has done.
'Cause that's the worst part.
I've even been on one of the checkpoints with him, which I found out from their schedule.
It's been months since the last episode of the series was published.
What's the response?
I mean especially in foreign viewers, which is what the series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them videos.
And when we go down Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people you see in the footage are standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
Seriously.
I'd put a web around them so people would look at them.
The Communism Museum right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need it?
Right.
I ride with services that I don't have to pay cash for, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there's no chance of fraud.
But there are a lot of dispatches that are fair.
I only took a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Wow, you've got some nerve."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported as early as 2005.
Former Mayor Pavel Bém set off in the same year for a control ride in disguise as an Italian tourist and immediately on the first attempt the driver cheated him by two hundred.
But editor Rubes had worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for driving from Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which is approximately CZK 195 per kilometer, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague Magistrate set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometer.
There are also other surprising sums in the film: for example, a two-kilometre journey from the street of Paris to Truhlář costs a tourist CZK 400.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
They charge even six hundred crowns for the journey to Angel, which has a mile [2.5 km].
Marble washes mostly with clean water, as much without chemistry and the longer the better.
Impurities go well out of it, although sometimes dirt must be put down with scalpels, it must be pulled out of the folds.
It's not easy, and it's not going fast, but the restorer Vanesa Trostová of Oldřichov, Hájy, approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the headstone is built with scaffolding, on which it is necessary to climb countless times and climb again.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and undemanding to the working environment," she stated.
In Frýdlant it is far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to it the stone elements of the facade in the back tract of the Frýdlant Town Hall, the statues of St. Mary Magdalena in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlant District, Marian column in Frýdlant and atlanta in the front of the spa in Nový Město pod Smrkem were restored.
The restoration of Melchiora, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the deposits of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; either they will anchor into the wall or to each other.
They are also expected to be treated and preserved on the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gilded again.
"Then the gilding of inscriptions on marble plates will begin with pure slice gold," said State Heritage Officer Věra Sobotová.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone has undergone any repairs.
At a closer look, the openings, drilled in marble columns, will be captured.
They're hundreds of years old, and they're left over from the tombstone decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedes raid during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
They brushed the tombstone literally, observed Saturday.
In the Church Find the Holy Cross are restorers with a slight exaggeration as at home.
After the 2010 flood, gravestones found underwater, baptizers, wall paintings in the tomb, and now a tombstone had to be fixed.
"We would also like to go to vitrage in the future," Saturday revealed.
The church is in a very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work to restore the Redernov tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128,000.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not put any money into this part of the restoration.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from winning the 2015 Historical City competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, specified by the mayor of Frýdlantu Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the winnings for the restoration of the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets observed through indexes and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who'd have thought that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% correction in February, is today at a new historical peak and has already credited 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that long-term traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which in the end have always achieved their goals.
In a situation where US shares are at a historical high, the volatility is thus disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown contently and without fear due to the quantitative easing of the US Central Bank, and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) has kept steadily below the 12 percent threshold.
And I don't want it to.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is in full swing, and in the past week, the Bank of England, which will buy £70 billion in bonds in the coming six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to an almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That's a million-dollar question, of course.
At the moment, however, there are no risks, the world economy is experiencing almost constant growth without greater fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and China is stabilising and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US shares continue to survive in a similar calm regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, Chief of the European Commission Juncker said, when he appointed the French politician (really experienced, because he had so many different supranational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) as the chief negotiator of the European Commission on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.
Juncker's selection has blown the hints of hope that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek out future forms of friendly co-existence with Britain.
However, most British media have adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As the Euro Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He took it as only he could have conceived it: the hardened enemy of Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The advocate of multilateral regulations was co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union and is envious of everything that comes from London's City Financial Center, he pushed through legislation overly harshly hard-boiled regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in dispute with London, will be a tough, tough, and probably a ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How not to remember in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance sheet, overview and ability of the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is why Czechs and Slovaks can today be the closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn a lesson from Václav Klaus - at least in this.
It would be good for everyone!
An earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin ruler released his loved Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from his post as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
She informed the Russian media about this with an appeal to the Kremlin's press service announcement.
Putin indicated that Ivanov was being released at his own request.
In a meeting carried by the Rossija 24 television station, the president said he was coming out to meet Ivanov's wish when taking office that he wanted to be chief of the presidential office for no more than four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the President's administration, now led by Ivanov's current deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, aged 63, is referred to as one of Putin’s closest collaborators.
For example, this former KGB officer in the past held the positions of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the seat of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, however, stated in his meeting with Putin that the length of the stay at the head of the administration of the head of state is actually a recordman.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in 25 years since her establishment, 11 people have been replaced in this capacity.
No one can play the finals with even the kvit or the deblists of Uncle Safář.
So far neither of Friday's tennis matches has managed to turn into the final turnout.
Petra Kvitová lost her first fight, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after the sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
The Czech debutist Šafářiová and Uncleová followed even a few moments later.
Although Williams sisters’ slayers reached for the win in the first set, they squandered two setbols, and the Russian finally captured the set in the short game.
The second set then lost a ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skifar Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with an overview, when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia by almost a second despite the slowing in the end.
Good today, conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, he said Son.
It was his rivals, unlike him, who had to fight for progress.
So it took their powers off, which could make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hands, the rower of Prague Dukla said.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in Snyko's footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rower took the fourth position in today's semi-finals in her riding, and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
They don't defend the gold of London that way.
I didn't make it to the finals at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I ran a good race, and I put everything I could into it.
The contestants were just better, Topink Knapek bowed before them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would make it to her fourth games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could advance from that field.
I was surprised that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the finals through Austrian.
Unfortunately, there was a life race today, said the 2011 World Champion.
Far beyond the final gates in Rio, a young shooter Filip Nepejchal remained, who failed to break through the qualification for the second time, this time a minor mark in a lie.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
Qualification went best for the Russians.
From the first rung advanced Sergei Kamensky with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepejchal's wipe was worth 620.5 points.
The program was first spoken by athletes, including Czech seven-fightrs Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová belongs eleventh place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record player Eliška Klučinová is twenty-twoth.
Leads British Katarina Johnson-Thomson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetress as well as continuously second Belgian Nafissata Thiam.
Both have provided historically the best altitude performance within the seven-fight.
They were still trying to jump 201 centimetres, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of such questions: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In both the great Eurosian nations, dictators occurred in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism reported by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent war leadership, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis wiped out about 6 million Jews in an inhuman way, and the total victims of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
Both Germans and Soviets carried out atrocities in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were to blame, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively or just cowardly, or by putting their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specificities of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, immediately ending the war came denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Father, grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?
How could you do that!
This brought true reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, German elites were mainly concerned about the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they also have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not want to connect back Alsace-Lotrinsko or someone - to a revansh - to a military attack - perhaps everyone will accept that.
After losing the Cold War in Russia, there was no major reflection.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often a criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Russia's putinian policy is to revansh, conquer lost territories, humiliate the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people are no value to vermin.
Fight yours, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the growth of tensions around Crimea?
Ukrainian Army.
In the last days and hours there has been a deterioration of the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimean area.
Who is benefiting from the growth of tension?
After a longer period of relative calm, there was again a further deterioration in relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The pretext of the Ukrainian Party became the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both enemy sides contradict each other and it is difficult to independently verify them, so we have the opportunity to think only about the old familiar question who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine naturally rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian special forces in Russia has already come from the case of pilot Savchenko that they were reportedly abducted in Russia.
If we agreed to the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly from the West, in the form of further acquittal of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a retreat from the situation in Ukraine against the background of the immigration crisis to Europe.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost complete credit in front of its residents when current support for President Poroshenko is around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have been bankrupt long ago, if it had not been for generous financial injections by the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention to its country once again vigorously in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to show up again as strong men who are not afraid to face the great Russia.
All we can hope for is that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both opposing sides and stop their enemy actions in time.
Bulgaria showed inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (as of June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12-month period (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the travels of these consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (3.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The U.S. Secret Services reportedly followed the hacker attacks of the Russians for a year.
Information on the Russian attacks went public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the party headquarters of Democrats.
But no official report mentions the Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied the share of the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top-secret, as its disclosure would reveal that U.S. intelligence is monitoring the hacker attack and could be exposed as well as the way they do it and the resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence agencies reportedly participated in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Board
The material on tracking the Russian trail was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reuters.
Of public officials, only a small group of eight prominent members of Congress, called the U.S. gang of eight, were informed.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers by Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, Chairmen of Democrats in both chambers by Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and by four members of the Congressional Defence and Security Committees.
Official Democratic Party Chief Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she was creating an advice board for cyber security to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of consumer's initiative on health problems after consumption of the food Salmon smoked - pieces 100 g, consumption date 22.11.2016 Prague health careian carried out a check in stores Albert on Wenceslas Square and Na Mostku.
The verification found that the lot L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer had already notified, was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of marine mammals' digestive tract.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and man-made live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Sticha.
We apologize to our customers for the problems of this brand product.
We immediately withdrew the lot from sale and for preventative reasons we withdrew all other batches of this item.
Mistakes took place on the side of the supplier we are dealing with, while we ourselves had this product tested, told the New Speakers of Albert Barbora Vanko.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it in any of the chain's stores and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vráta.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemia veterinary administration of the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the food safety server.cz, people after ingestion of the parasite may become ill by anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, CTK said.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of larvae disease, they usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures and are therefore killed either in sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or in freezing it.
Veterinarians have currently checked the salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemia Region.
Three of the five samples examined had a parasite in them.
The shipment with 1,700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expedited, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, was a 919 package to date.
Currently, the unsold product stock is being withdrawn from the stores, said SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Rakka, killed by a Russian raid, apparently.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage with a jihadist who was soon killed, sobering came.
The expected paradise of the Caliphate turned for British girls into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She made repeated calls to Britain and confided that she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without sense, quotes The Telegraph by the lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last leads led to Rakka, the last time the girl heard from her.
Then there was only a report of her death, which could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they hoped to meet the former student again.
However, Kadiza was likely killed before she could escape, as the house in which she stayed compared in May to the ground of the raid was reported by the British ITV News.
TV added that the bomb apparently dropped a Russian plane attacking the IS bastion in Syria.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week when she (Kadiza) was thinking of fleeing Islamic State territory, a Austrian woman was caught trying to escape, and according to the available information, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she took it as a warning and decided not to take risks, according to the BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old friends from Shamima Beguma and Amira Abasa School, embarked on a trip on 17 February last year.
All they said at home was they were going out.
However, they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey to an IS-controlled territory.
According to a lawyer, the girl's family did everything in its power to get Kadiz back.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything it could, straining all the power to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught by themselves, a lawyer added.
The only positive thing he believes is that Kadiza's fate can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went there, realized how things were going there, understood how far that differs from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee further said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also been silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries the municipality of Inveraray was the county center and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held at the town hall, and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions under which the convicts resided were woeful and many prisoners attempted to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
Therefore, city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
It has not been in operation for a long time, its closure was due to economic reasons already in late August 1889, as smaller repair facilities were costly for operation and did not pay much.
Tales of convicts and ghost hunts.
The prison opened for the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new building to see for themselves how different conditions existed in them.
Guides in period costumes amplify the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can get locked up in one of the cells, mostly because of a photograph in memory, or to create a feeling that the prisoners are experiencing behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish locations where it is reported to haunt.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have gone out there, and the museum still allows people to come hunting ghosts.
However, such a night will cost £300, which is approximately CZK 9,500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the municipalities also attract great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animated, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat app enables about 150 million users to change reality each day and play with the identity of ways bordering on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a character that appears to have come out of the picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies each day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism with allegations that the application promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin hues as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered the users a filter this week that gave them slanted eyes, twisted teeth and inflated faces, some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated issues did not point to the greater problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it and the news and indignation spread rapidly, and Snapchat stated the next day that he had cancelled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of accounts to cartoon characters of animé, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But the filter reminded observers who witnessed racism of painful stereotypes in action.
Others flatly compared to the animé rejected.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea, whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in an e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is hard to argue against comparing obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellow face, but that the yellow face is drawn to a disdainful extreme.
Snapchat is not the only society that has exceeded these cultural limits.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle about diversity and inclusion, from meeting halls in corporations to Holywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to some users," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu on Thursday in an interview, "it's very hard to get past these things today without notice, as it used to be."
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview over the phone, she said she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected a lack of diversity in recruitment of Snapchat workers.
Katie Zhu criticized the vast white, completely male leadership of society and the article ended with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they have no diversity and color people among employees at the moment these things are decided," said Zhu, who has Chinese-American origins, "or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak."
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees, with its private company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokeswoman, the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on an under-represented population and internal inclusion management.
Zhuová adds: "I wonder if they really need other such users who can say it's not okay," with their account being cancelled.
Army officers misrepresented intelligence information about IS, says the parliamentary committee
In a report issued on Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee stated that officers from the United States Central Headquarters were changing intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events from the country provided.
According to a preliminary report by the working group drawn up by the Republican Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defence Subcommittee, a "extensive discontent" among Central Intelligence analysts was identified, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is an Army Central in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A press release to the report states: “Exit intelligence intelligence services approved by Centcom superior officers usually offered a more positive image of US counterterrorism efforts than confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when misanalyses are presented to senior policy makers," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican from California.
The failure in the management of Centcom goes back to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analyzing American efforts in training Iranian forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decisive evidence is offered that the Obama administration’s leaders ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts felt that Centcom’s leaders were under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the Central Staff, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were," the report states.
For example, Centcom's representative publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said MP Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top-ranking intelligence staff of the U.S. Central Staff handled the output of the staff's intelligence services in order to bagate the IS hazard in Iraq.
Republicans compiled a working group after learning about analyst concerns about intelligence information relating to the Islamic State being manipulated.
A report published on Thursday must be followed up by a more detailed investigation.
Centcom's intelligence services are still under further investigation conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very narrow process for compiling the evaluation of IS information and the Iranian security forces," said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Deputy Democrats in a statement.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “leaded to distorting the output of intelligence services," he damaged morale among analysts and “inadequately took into account dissenting views."
However, Schiff and the Democrats argue that they have found no evidence that the White House is attempting to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to "a draft or political situation."
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by Pentagon Inspector General, which was initiated following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-chief Patrick Evans, Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report, as the Inspector General's investigation is still ongoing.
However, he stated that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental questions of national security."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the Americans led by bombing in Iraq and Syria are successful (a statement now declaring a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's allegations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
The criticism of news on the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than a decade, when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration, despite the objections of many analysts, had defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in resistance to Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements of the opposite, air strikes led against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group, as the group had built temporary refiners and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings but were not transmitted outside the Central Staff.
Centcom's commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism the past year after many legislators found Senate testimony too positive by assessing the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The US won field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be a decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam in a match against Japan, who finished with a 6:1, scored three goals and only one day later for the American women's field hockey team, scored the first two goals of the match in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five wickets in two matches is a success worth remembering, but Bamová (27) said that she was not sure if she had ever succeeded in doing such a thing.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who writes down their wickets.
But he knows this: Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4-0 matches and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after defeating Japan 2:0.
Great Britain and the United States will clash on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will finish in first and second place.
The team from the first place avoids the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group a little longer.
No matter how the Saturday game ends, the Americans here caused a stir with their surprise ride, four years after finishing among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey hockey stick for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older sisters twins played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics escaped her because she did not make the final roster.
Then came 2012 when neither she nor members of her team were doing very well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bamová said.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night Bamová started in the first half by shooting a goal bekendem from nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly hard and maintained a score of 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then clicked into the center and scored the ball into the wicket to get the American women in the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last wicket in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three wins helped to one goal, was the first ever at the tournament.
She's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Zen trampolines amid Olympic rampage
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make it feel persistent, indescribable and biased by the rotation of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay stake passed from a gunman to a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlon player.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspapers, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will sound in households in prime time between advertising and spot sponsors if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley (28) of Lake Forest, California fights for Olympic gold in jumps on a trampoline.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine on all competitions the same way.
Away from the center, a bit in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style, and he will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my special favorite, let me point out the subtle spell of the trampoline.
Although the jumps on the trampoline have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first featured at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport has remained almost unnoticed - many of the people I asked about, nor did they even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US never won a medal in trampoline jumps, and none of the athletes made it to the finals until 2012.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will embrace Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline have yet another bad luck, in part because the ear of the uninitiated will seem more suitable for the clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but just a country-watching enthusiast.
It has comic potential - comical vibrations of endless reflection - but also the tuning of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine in each other.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampoline", meaning "jumpboard."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform assemblies with several elements (salts, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed by implementation, difficulty and "times in the air".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic Railway is forward.
Warriors for gold medals must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, other times there and back, up and down.
They try to catch up not only with the finish tape or the starting wall, but, as TV news reports, also with another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a little exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The athlete's track on the trampoline is up.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she is reflected, as if they were in a weightless state as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is not possible, but during the duration of the line-up there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only perfect, delicious suspension of time and gravity.
This is the closest thing the Olympics and zen will ever get.
Qualification and final of women takes place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock eastern time, men's competitions then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC station will air the finals within the afternoon block, starting both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment that you will most likely overlook through the other battles.
And if attention is to be reached only by male athletes being the subject of love views and materialization - as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by US gymnasts - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to gasp.
"Protesting Generations" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have come across violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses claim that many protesters were shot during clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government unrest has swept the country, spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses claim that police officers have been shot and killed by armies of unarmed protesters.
On the circulating video recordings of protests probably coming from the end of last year or early this year, members of the security forces are captured beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to move forward," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa Research Group International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of terrorist attacks in the area, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved substantially - there is even a new suburban train in Addis Abeba's capital.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without ceasing talks about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breach," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
There are many complaints, and they concern everything from soil disputes to absolute control over the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, pressure is increasing on the border with Eritrea. A conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylithians fear that separatist groups that have been suppressed more or less over the past years, such as the Oroma Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings have rekindled after years of smouldering beneath the surface.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when they have become commonly available cheaper smartphones and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as it normally happens primarily during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered in protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between Oroma and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and exploited Oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on our way to a united leadership," said Mulat Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests occurred in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigraj ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, an earlier rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an undefined disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly masterfully able to detect the initial signals of discontent and used the envoys to process and win the opponents on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigra region of northern Ethiopia, comes from Hailemariam from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that blood spilling will result.
Last time Ethiopia experienced such riots in 2005, thousands of people protested what analysts called elections that the government had messed up and then stole.
There was a hard hit, during which many protesters were killed - although less than in the past months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month protesters in the town of Gondar, Amhar, attacked business firms owned by the Tigers and resentment against the Tigers on social networks became increasingly common.
Analysts say that protests put the US and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, although it recently stated that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile area to fall apart.
"That," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to bagatelize the latest controversy on Friday, flooding his campaign, stating that he did not mean it when several times this week he insisted that Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an uncomfortable situation, who have defended him vigorously in a stormy time and must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
Following this proposal at the Wednesday night meeting, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the talks that he really did not intend to say that the president and H. Clinton had created IS.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump stated that he was merely sarcastic.
The paper was the opposite of saying an old one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remark ease by reminding Obama that he was trying to destroy IS, Republican candidate for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes at the moment Trump attempted to focus attention on his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in electoral polls are dropping.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel in Michigan this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
Again, on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, stating that some said her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defenses earlier.
At the end of July, when he reaped a wave of criticism when he spoke with the suggestion that the Russians should penetrate Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remark by saying, "Of course, I am sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to temper them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some reports have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction, he then “explained,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that he is skillful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to explain them differently.
As the results of the election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more snappy tone in recent days, instead of moderating things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, published on Friday, showed that Tump was far from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and very close to her in Florida.
Trump tries at all to avoid apologizing for provocative statements he says, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But, along with Trump's increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes put into an uncomfortable situation his devoted supporters, who must publicly stand behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively on Thursday in an interview for CNN.
"I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when asked about Trump's assurance that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization he called a novice, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most common Republicans try to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, allowed IS to run rampant and unable to handle the Middle East situation aggressively.
Prior to Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to rain fire on Twitter on the media for misrepresenting his every word and being biased towards him.
He laughed at the "poor, pathetic" television scholars who tried to understand him, saying, "They can't!"
Several Democrats snarled Trump's apology that it was just further evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency.
The café has been pushed out of the market by prices. Now it returns in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe Café was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced from the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea hotel looted and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is a change, then it's also rediscovering.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
New Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Also coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café, who is also the owner and executive director of the new site.
In Verb he began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do it with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bread supplier and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even used the lighting from the old Verbo again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The offer includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
There are also brown rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original regulars.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg due to prices", he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers was here, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
It even occurred when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbo," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she had mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
They go before work and order the same thing every time.
"I come here every day at quarter and eight, like clockwork, and they're already preparing my bagel with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr Rosenthal continues to order what he normally does, but occasionally he puts bacon, eggs, and ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry the soap business took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
Traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also received the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it up soon to make his new neighbors feel at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice manufacturer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the cafe to expand into a neighboring building.
Many customers are satisfied to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopens, coming in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressed food from the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the presidency in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
Swan President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from the 5th Avenue, such as goose pâté and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: eggs on the devilish way in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans to eat. ”
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are devoted to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the story of a living house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, A Square Meal, published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
Sami showed cooking solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small steep buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which according to the couple was excellent for talking about food during the crisis.
"The meatballs were very popular", said Ms. Ziegelman.
It sold peanuts, livers, and bean meatballs.
They were produced from the ingredient and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe smirk.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet to eat what you eat.
Women's teams were cooking for farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. “A Square Meal” watches the ways in which the nation was coping with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said in explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally feared: Mysterious foods, like meatballs and castress dishes, have spread, as a “wonderful way to take advantage of the leftovers,” noted Ziegelman, as the cooks could hide unesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the central point of American food - has become a cost-effectively allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures that were to serve as caloric and nutritional fillings had priority over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During a book survey that contains recipes, Miss Zigelman prepared a period meal of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: “It was surreal. ”
Peanut butter with baked onions doesn't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never thereafter, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the Federal Bureau of Domestic Economy shrer from 1923 to 1943 - managed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the reins of the budget, and slops such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned into tasty meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, desserts arose in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I'll have a pie".
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farming cuisine of his childhood, he dined as the selected millionaire he became.
"He likes to eat continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him set an example with his own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, which led to the White House being “not only served the most humble meal in all of Washington, but also in the most disgruntled way prepared."
A number of eating habits from a time of crisis faded away as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
A couple say that while writing a book, they understood Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits better - like why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: “People were sick of her. ”
There's been a wreath accident.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly shoved a spoon into thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as a proper housekeeper, he said to his wife: “A bit of meatloaf would be nice. ”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most refugees who are rolling into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's what shows would look like if we shot them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us are making fun of their native country.
Using the photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show what it would look like if famous series and films were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of legal representation in the case of a type C hepatitis patent against the Merck Group
The district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal fees incurred in the process of patent against hepatitis C against the Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturer.
In June, the judgment that Gilead was to pay 200 million for damages due to the violation of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi, and Harvoni, after the federal judge found repeatedly illegal acts on Merck's side, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated on Thursday's file that Gilead was entitled to the waiver of fees incurred in connection with the case's representation.
Merck tries to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the next generation market of drugs against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other claiming to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of Gilead drugs.
Americans supported by military forces claim to have gained full control of Manbij City
U.S.-backed military units gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, stating the group's spokesman on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after the departure of the rest of the radical group who were hiding in the city.
The troops liberated over 2,000 civilians who were detained by radicals, telling Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Military Council of Manbídž.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton posted her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue in that year and had actually paid a tax of 34.2 percent.
The Clintons in 2015 donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation). Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed to the joint register by almost $5.3 million worth of fees for lectures, and the former Secretary of State admitted $3 million of income from Simon & Schuster's publishing house for his book on his work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Caine of the State of Virginia along with his wife Anne Holton published tax returns in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency," she said in a statement to Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backs away from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited the US Treasury Tax Department's audit as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
"Your move," Hillary Clinton's aide said on Twitter and followed up on Democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump advisor, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, among whom is the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charity contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has made a strong appearance on the issue and posted a video on Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish her tax returns.
On Thursday, they mention the question in their speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other presidential candidates have done for decades - publish their tax returns," she said in front of the people.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and New York Times publicist cited a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim it may be so even in the present day.
Federal tax rates became a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton advocates a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that anyone who makes more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at the Clinton Assembly in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway resides, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also passed an IRS audit and that Trump was "not afraid" of the Financial Authority, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns retroactively until 2007.
Clinton, who now live in Chappy, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 Clinton tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, wages in their incomes amount to just $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to human dwellings - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
This procedure proved to be successful and Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservation, promotes this process and trains volunteers in villages in north Tanzania, how, using this nonviolent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used a spear to defend themselves earlier.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to protecting these animals.
“Since they developed this... set of tools, we have noted a change of behavior in these communities. People believe that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Honeyguide Damian Bell, executive director in a statement.
The first and second steps are on the passing elephant to light the flashlight and run the horn.
If it does not deter him, the so-called "chilli cloud" will be thrown out.
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with a firecracker into a condom, its end is wrapped in a way that only the wick can see from it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder is spread into the air.
Usually just one whiff, and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which triggers a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel on "application" Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have the code for calling to Israel, according to the employee's words, on the basis of the "demand" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary film on the Holocaust “Shoah”, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel's call code list.
However, the state was not inducted between countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel instead offers the possibility of calling Israel through its own call center.
The director sought an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, "shocked".
The hotel worker replied that the measure was “decided upon the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this move made the director even more angry.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's call code be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the staff in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great disgrace".
We were appalled and shocked by the events.
In itself, it's a huge disgrace.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong online reaction, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"The shame to you," states another post, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble street of Kurfurstendamm, stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the event "overlooking" and "apologizing to Lanzman".
"Never a direct order has been issued" not to include Israel in the call code list, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung as the representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against Brazilian students protesters
The student and police clash occurred in San Paul, Brazil, Thursday, when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesters.
The problem escalated when government order services attempted to disperse students, which ended with police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of San Paulo State Governor Gerald Alckmin in order to save money is also the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spraying signs against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the protesters embarked mass on the streets in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the Senate in the country decided to sue her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryana has increased by 70.9 percent since the abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran in a year-on-year comparison.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were abolished, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms trading in the country.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same 2015 period and reached an amount of $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent, reaching $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The leap increase in trade ensured supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas, mostly travel to Iran.
Moreover, Iran first reached the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
Safely said, the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians, and the ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner rushes home after the British have won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint on a velodrome in Rio when the VB team's trio defended the title from London 2012.
A 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the brake he took for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man pleased the legend when he stormed into the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of a favored New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the end of the modest sixth at the World Race Cycling Championship in March, although Hoy in the meantime ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for specialized opening racer Jamie Staff.
So Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoye's departure, a seat was also opened that he attempted to fill in Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was along with Hoy the champion four years ago - and with Skinner they reached the Olympic qualifying record, but the leotard took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his round, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a major part of the transformation when Hindes drove on a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes ascended the stage, he did not take his eyes off them.
Twenty - three - year - old Skinner, a Glasgow native, said: “It’s a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best of myself and to honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the runway after a weak start.
He later withdrew the note and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said: “With all the British flags on the bleachers, I felt like I was in London. ”
In the last three months, we've all joined up as a team.
We lost in many of the world's races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then there are five days of success waiting for us on the velodrome.
With the form Kenny performed, it is not unthinkable that he repeated Hoy's success and won three gold medals at one Olympics simultaneously.
It would then for Kenny - who is exactly on a day 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems sacred to British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meaning a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Just as much as Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will be taking part in a sprint that starts today and takes another three days.
A 21 - year - old native from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this one.
A team race is always the best.
You're winning along with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “If he wins two more gold medals, he should be given a knighthood title. ”
This was the only medal race of that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest to pursue the squad race for four kilometres.
They finished with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) are held on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will surely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the referees called him to measure height.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavie achieved a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of track cycling and dominated the middle period of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations declined during preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the ending of a career of great men such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the Velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of the plant in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum melting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies electricity and which informed one of the owners of the melting plant's intention to terminate the electricity supply contract.
This move takes place after the Government of Victoria decided earlier that year that it would not prolong the granting of subsidies that keep the company running.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk in Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be threatened when closed.
And since the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, other avalanche effects may occur.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant in 2014, leading to the closure of Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's factory in Portland is profitable and threatens to close it.
This move follows several years of speculation about the company's future, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to plant production prices.
The AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley Valley, stated that it expected that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Aluminium, with small business shares held by Chinese company CITIC and Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to function, in other words, that the radial demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called ‘insurance contracts’, which were to enter into force from November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will participate in the profits for fiscal year 2017’, declared the power plant.
In addition, any possible impact on the profits of AGL since the fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of the contracts according to its books of $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract ‘does not affect its ... ability to operate a melting plant or to secure the supply of electricity to a melting plant."
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was to start to apply from November this year, although it still has to explain why she had given up on the contract.
Analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
Head of operations of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago around 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the market [electric power].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of Kardashian's real estate TV show - she is now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner's mother-manager, appeared on the cover of the September edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the ambassador of Estee Lauder, who performed at a fashion week in Milan, Paris, and New York City, announced the news on Thursday in her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this cover," Kendall wrote.
Revealing the cover was followed by bizarre (or simply continuing the humour in the submission of Kardashian?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar rioters Rob and Caitly and along with them all favorite uncle from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sister, they forgot, only so that the scene could end in a classic turn: they are preparing a secret party.
It is a played storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of the children's television show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we forgot you?" with the frankness of a cartoon rabbit on the show at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that the other girls could feed on this publicity.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we certainly entered the new Kardashian era.
Elder sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it along with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is another league.
The September edition of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The release, which by its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that of 832 pages last year there were 615 pages with advertising content).
Uncovering the star that appears on the front page is eagerly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the magazine’s images have escaped before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, or Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "celebritys that make models" have appeared on the front page than "models that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar holder and Ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the headline in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - whom the magazine describes as a "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, nor stars of real estate shows, or children today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult due to her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model in June criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "whores of the moment".
These feelings flared up again with news of Jenner appearing on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the real sense.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare moments, he performs on a reality show, maybe only as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Law Aid Centers reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid in community centres each year, and in the sector itself they are preparing for impacts that will have further restrictions on funds for already extremely busy services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unjust eviction, etc. - are already being rejected when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to burst, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of community legal aid centres in Queenslad James Farrell said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community legal aid centres, it was found that 5,000 people were rejected every year.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision being lifted, the situation would deteriorate.
"Community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families undergoing separation, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they do not have the chance to get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands of threatened Queensland people having to find their way into complex legal problems without help.
We call on the U.S. Attorney and Senator of Queensland George Brandis to stop this cutback immediately, to get people the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the state has kept its commitment to ensuring the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of community legal aid centres and the community of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Action for Donald Trump's campaign after a member of staff reportedly pointed the gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inactivity after being informed that the director of operations in North Carolina in February pointed the gun at a member of staff while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a court file handed over on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software campaign trainer in the state.
Bordini said that for months he had been waiting for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that “this would not happen.”
Principal Earl Phillip “marked his fingers with a gun, put the right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's kneecap", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini, following complaints from local and regional campaign management, found that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"The guns don't have to fire to cause damage", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that they could intervene owners and arms holders (which is regulated in the US in the Second Amendment of the Constitution) if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and can appoint her judges.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and inflicting emotional harm.
Trump's spokesperson Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to a report requesting comment.
The attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news branch in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one has responded to the call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services in a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump runs a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of restoration and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is enormously attractive, just as London 2012 was, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games marked huge benefits for both Startford and East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching posts, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think that the extension of Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would mock ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the Heathrow case, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of £211 billion, a legacy in the form of skills and employment both in the vicinity of the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which, by the deadline and budget set, introduced a £11 billion infrastructure investment program, starting with the T5 terminal - which was elected by the best terminal in the world five years in a row, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway worth £16 billion of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be so too.
It is time for us to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade in the future and leave behind the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in Cat and Mouse Game in Ad Blocking
Attempts to bypass advertising-blocking programs have become a cat-and-mouse game for online marketing companies. At least so says one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook stated Tuesday that its desktop website would change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims they've already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this sort of war between the community of open source blocking ads and those trying to bypass them has lasted ever since advertising was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-repair.
The fact that the company that owns the largest social network in the world has been involved in the war only proves how much of a problem advertising blocking for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair performed the tissue last year, and Adobe uses filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times as many as it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of Facebook advertising profits, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
A spokesperson said that the company is going against advertising filters on desktops, however, because mobile advertising filters for mobile applications for social network and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on desktops still represents a profit high enough to make Facebook choose to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it would update the tool for "ad preferences" to give people a better chance to control how ads are displayed.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters concerned them, as they could also block content that is unrelated to advertising on the site.
"It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," Facebook spokeswoman said in an email statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and we have therefore rather focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences that will give control to people.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an event in which a woman, probably trying to commit suicide, was run over on the highway in the morning on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the Vaud canton shortly after midnight in Thursdays.
The Vaud police stated in a statement that the actor of the "freaky act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman at the age of 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to police, they have still not all been identified. Police call on these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to sign up.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said for Le Tribune de Geneve attorney Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent an impact?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out," said Hofstetter.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, drivers do not appear to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was relieved of charges for negligent manslaughter after hitting and killing a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in August 2014.
In court, it was said that the victim, aged 22, had been drinking alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - had gone in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should log in to the police at number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination of LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agents and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague to come to Prague.
On Friday, the CEO of AČKA Kateřina Petříčková told us.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival closers the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT).
About 35,000 people attended the event last year.
"Prague is among the most popular destinations of LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by organizers, foreign visitors spend CZK 3100 a day per person on average.
Gay tourists are provided with special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price relations with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
As part of the festival programme, the first Pride Tourism Symposium is also held this year.
It is lectured by LGBT tourism experts from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The top of the festival will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
This year, the parade, attended by thousands of people in recent years, honors a minute of silence in memory of victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat have been celebrating for 40 years.
The indisputable handymen Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained both small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries in the world, were cartoon jokes by an artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who he designed for a magazine with two tricks by Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to cooperate and together created the film Kuťáci.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red trick and a kulich and radio was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovakian television began to be created in the Crate film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were given by the handymen in 1985, this time it was made directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works with other creators continued, many of which were attended by Beneš's son Mark.
There are currently over 90 episodes with the stories of these handymen, which all come under hand, but they are never angry at each other and are always filled with optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and ultimately they are satisfied with their work, as evidenced by the famous gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from television screens to books, DVDs and theatres, and characters or other toys depicting Pat and Mat are the hits of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen one sport and one life for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what things do people spend most on at airports?
That's a Friday review from the world's web site.
First medals from the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The Ragby selection of this archipelago defeated the UK team in the finals of the Seven Rugby Olympic tournament.
This is the first medal Fiji ever won for itself at the Olympics.
The wait for the first precious metal to gain lasted sixty years from sending out the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Fiji’s coach bears great credit for success.
But it's ironic that Brit Ben Ryan is.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play loose and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the final.
In the end, Fiji was dominated, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic story.
The report was delivered by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living with no arms and legs since 11 months, has been given a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced, as her mother revealed to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, with doctors giving it only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and never gives up.
He's got perspective.
I saw her introduce herself to the other kids with the words "Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, my mother delivered.
Look at the joy the doll has brought.
What do we spend most on at the airport?
CNN brings in a finding that people at airports spend most of their money on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel essential store chain has published data for the last year, summarizing 10 products that customers buy most often at its airports stores.
The water was sovereignly the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large pack of M&M coconut-flavored candy.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
You can't eat one of the above things.
CNN says it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win. Murray and Bond laughed.
rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have been reigning sovereignly in the category of twos without a helmsman for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, they scored 69th in a row on Thursday's final.
What makes us different from the others?
We are simply prettier, joking Murray already during the Olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the New Zealand pair's dominance.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We're just practicing hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray already more seriously.
Their domination is notable even because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-metre and a hundred-pound manger, academically-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Moreover, they are of a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, for example, Murray has had a charity boxing match.
That's why they don't spend much time together outside rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
Let's just go win.
I tend to think about what can go wrong, admitted Bond, who also demonstrated at the press conference that Murray was dominant in the crew.
He was the one who always answered first, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, it destroys the opponents with calm force.
They are moving at their pace, and although they are often not at the head of the line, the opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile to the finish line.
We're just trying to keep up a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 34-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, the biggest defeat of their careers seems to have been atonement, and the dominance has also been confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were doing mentally well, Murray said.
We all know they want to overthrow us.
We still have the target on our backs.
We're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Space Study Institute of Goddard developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those on Earth could exist on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated CO2.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to be proud of the earthlike sparse atmosphere, turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were likely drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to control life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus had also previously used the sun, which was 30 percent more subdued.
"In the simulation of the GISS model Venus during slow rotation exposes his daily side to the sun almost two months at once," explained scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the rain is created, creating a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and shield the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to evolution, previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over a few billion years -- she was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated, and water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, and only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide remains with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned from the Colorado Avalanche team's position as coach
Patrick Roy resigned from his position as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche team's hockey operations on Thursday, stating as the reason the impossibility of participating in the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice president/general manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the move and stated that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I spent a long and intense summer wondering how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is essential that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team benefits.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's top coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to earn 112 points and first place in the Central Division. However, Colorado struggled with Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and over the last two years, his games did not always work out after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season reached a score of 39:39:4 and missed five points to earn a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who enrolled in the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil platform renew talks and interrupt strike
The leaders of the parties said that the wage strikes for oil platform workers in the North Sea were interrupted while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the company of services for Wood Group oil fields sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current disagreements," the statement states.
Starting next week, we will have a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to union organizations, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent to protest wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell struck thousands of people off his payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernise its processes - immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
A Member of Parliament from Scotland Dave Anderson met with union leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest labor disagreements of the entire generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital to the region’s economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said in a statement.
For comparison, in 2016 nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average for the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of turning stars in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of star rotation speeds from the Pleiades cluster.
New data helps astronomers to understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how turning times are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebullová, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena in a new report.
The cluster of Pleiades is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in clusters are now reaching adulthood and have been created for about 125 million years.
He's turning the fastest now.
At an instant of maximum rotation speed, these teenage stars release huge amounts of starwind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the age of the star, its rate of rotation is slowing.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of distinguishable points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotation speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" Pleiad we see that slower spinning stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiad cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades provide us anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot we want to know about how, when, and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation, so to speak, "hanging their dancing shoes on the nail".
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of Pleiad rotation speeds in three studies soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualifying agreement wouldn't be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without enrolling in specialization education after graduation?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now only a job available in a somewhat distant hospital, but in about six months, a place in another place where I would like to work.
So I do not know how to deal with the situation about that six months ago, the question continues.
Corresponds to Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualifying agreement with an employer - a hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure that the costs incurred in connection with increasing or deepening the qualifications of the employee are recovered.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being exerted to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring occupational mobility for health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional competence and specialised competence for the pursuit of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly true that participation in specialization education is considered to be an extension of qualifications (not as an increase in the qualification).
This means that the qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or obligation to enroll in specialization education is required.
The Act only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is already entitled to pursue the profession of physician by completing the necessary university studies, although under the statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialist competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where specialist training of a doctor may include professional practice completed in another field of specialization, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questionable situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the detailed circumstances of this case, a consultation with the relevant Department of Health (Department of Science and Medical Occupations) can be recommended, as the Ministry of Health provides by law advisory and consulting services related to the inclusion in specialization education and its course.
The Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member, also provides the advisory service free of charge.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab are asking for US intervention.
The United States did not make any effort to end the siege (insurgent parts of the city by government troops), and did not use its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, quoting from a letter addressed to the White House by the AFP agency.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over East Halab to stop attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces that support the army loyal to President Bashar Assad have announced that, from today on, they will stop every day for three hours strikes in the Halabu area to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELČ are to be stopped all military activities, air attacks and artillery fire.
UN relief operations chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed it, however, stressed the need for at least a two-day truce.
In a letter, according to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who operate in the eastern part of Halabu were contacted by rebels.
It says that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel death of countless patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world watches and notes how complicated Syria is, but does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like slightly clouded threats, pointed out by pediatricians, surgeons, and other doctors.
Doctors have reported that 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of which to hospitals in which they work, have been recorded over the past month.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
In the emergency room, young children come to us with such serious injuries that we must choose among them those most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, to describe the doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the explosion cut off the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They gasped for air and then their lives ended - before they could actually begin, they recalled.
The army loyal to President Bashar Assad, supported by Russian forces, surrounded in recent weeks by insurgents controlled by the eastern part of Halab, with over 200,000 people inside without food supply.
