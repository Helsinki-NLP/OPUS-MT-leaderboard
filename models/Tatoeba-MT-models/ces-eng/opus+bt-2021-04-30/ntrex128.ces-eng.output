Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “look like Muppets ”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are disheartened by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal are plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name might provoke ridicule.
A member behind the Labour Party said that his group fears that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
The Plaid Party member said that the group as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative stated that his group approached a change in the name "with an open mind", but noted that MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation for the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on what members of the Welsh Assembly will, of course, be on the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public meeting on proposals, where broad support was given to the variant of calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of the title of members of the Assembly, the commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the largest support in public discussion.
The members of the Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can bring concern to President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to present a draft legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members and the draft system of committees.
The members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
The Macedonians will vote to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether the name of their country will change to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote should resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek territory, and repeatedly protesting the country's membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes plebiscit about changing the name, stated that he would not follow the vote.
But referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be quiet because the churches in Harlem are struggling to survive.
"The old people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams says.
"Today there is neither."
He thinks the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are seeing each other in a different way today," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
With regard to churches, he fears that money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their officials expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started. ”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such type of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and so soon the day will come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who will move into the apartments will become church members."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the Negro congregation, whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin took over the black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who headed the retailer boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping tabloid in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
The fire badly damaged the building in 1939, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered the chimes.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin, proudly called the chimes of the poor.
An expert who played the chimes in July called it otherwise: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first wind chime played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger wind chime in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders took place at St. Martin's, some of which were summoned by lay church officials, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
In July, the Board of Elders – the head of the parish, consisting of lay officials – sent a letter to the Diocese, in which he expressed concern that the diocese would “try to pass the costs” to the council of elders, although it did not participate in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California diving for lobsters
According to an official report, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on the day the lobster season began.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy call for help, and then paddled to him with the whole group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel stated that the call first considered the joy of the lobster catch, but then “he realized that he was shouting ‘ biting me!
He bit me!'"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that “he had torn the entire area of the clavicle. ”
"I screamed for everyone to go out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel adds.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego.
It is unknown what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles at a press conference stated that the shark had been spotted in this area several weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities for investigation and security have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to face the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains with beauty alleys in the style of a department store where specialized saleswomen will be available.
As part of the strong entry into the UK cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion sales and domestic needs are decreasing, the cosmetics lanes will be tested in 11 stores across the country. If successful, they will then expand to other stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to supermarkets' efforts to find use for shelves previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and household supplies.
Sainsbury's reports that it doubles the amount of cosmetic product supply up to 3,000 products and first mentions brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also be given to the existing range from brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to brand places similar to those in stores like Boots.
The Supermarket also reintroduces its product range of make-up Boutique, making most products vegan, which young customers increasingly demand.
In addition, the two Saintsbury’s stores will test the franchise of the Fragrance Shop perfume retailer. The first such shop opened in Croydon, south London last week, and another one will be created in Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
Shopping on the Internet and moving towards everyday shopping for a small amount of food in local shops means supermarkets need to try harder to attract people.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says that stores will increasingly look like department stores because the supermarket chain is trying to better offer services and non-food products to combat discount vendors such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened up in hundreds of Argos branches and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he purchased two years ago, making food sales more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to redecorate the department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended infamous.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after an argument over the distribution of drug proceeds in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmacies chain.
Lloyds has a plan to play its part by adding to four stores an expanded range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The business director of Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues that customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and tempting environments and convenient location means that we now represent an attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is "infuriated" after Holly Willoughby stepped down from the contract for £11 million
Dragons Day star Peter Jones is "angry" after television presenter Holly Willoughby stepped down from a $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothing brand and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to the brand of Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old show host announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons' star The Day of Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to information sources, Jones “rogued, ” when the television star would no longer be able to devote enough time to their home clothing brand in Marlow, Buckinghamshire due to new contracts – worth up to £1.5 million – to their tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business was compared to the brand of Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of presenter Willoughby at an estimated value of £11 million.
When 37 - year - old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones set off from Britain to one of her summer residences.
An unnamed source states: “Truly’s brand was a major priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which will provide it for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was completely shocking to all involved.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at Marlow Central."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, who is one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to a large investment in pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and a possible further delay in branding.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three children Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and fifty-two-year-old Jones joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin while hosting I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs".
Difficult behavior “and then we fell in love ”
He joked about criticism given to him by journalists as a remark that some consider to be “unworthy president” and how he speaks positively of North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his mocking "voicecaster" voice.
"I didn't give up on anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump appreciated it as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim was interested in another meeting.
But the nuclear weapon disposal negotiations are deadlocked.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "corresponding response" from the US on its first steps to disarm.
Instead, the US continues sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
According to him, his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results – ending missile tests, helping in liberating the hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing out the crowd ahead.
The tsunami wave and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the situation following the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs, for example, learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been driven out of their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that they did not require international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," says Mrs. Sumbung.
The Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can work here.
The spokesperson for the National Disasters Agency, Mr Sutupo, said that Indonesian workers are evaluating the situation in Paul to see if it will be possible for international organisations to help.
As earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the earth is still woefully unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not common at all on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens in Paul’s warning against tsunamis, even when a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of human lives.
Even in the best time travel among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that anchored in Lombok and helped earthquake victims is now moving to Paul, but will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
Improving poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and President spent much money on roads and railroads.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding failures.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority adopt a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of over a thousand people, and tens of thousands have driven people out of their homes.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored at the London Stamford Bridge in the 89th minute, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres outside Chelsea's gate when his team lost 1–0.
He switched the ball to his left and fired to a distant pole.
The shot flew high and headed to the top right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually jumped over the jumping Kepu Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
"I only tried to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I wanted to buy as much time as possible." said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach me, so I didn't think much about it and fired at one touch."
Chelsea at halftime led 1–0 after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues assailant sent the passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted halfway through Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball.
Then he sent the ball down the beautiful aisle to Hazard in the lime.
He escaped defense and ended with a left to a remote pole alongside Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Wednesday at 15pm, Liverpool in the Champions League group at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, will compete with the local team.
Chelsea will play Thursday at 3pm in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Authority reported on Sunday morning, the number of victims of earthquakes and tsunami waves climbed to 832.
The 7.5 degree earthquake struck on Friday, sparking waves of up to 6 metres high and trapping many people in the ruins of collapsed buildings, said at a press conference a spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugro's office.
The city of Paul, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was swept up by the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
This morning, a female body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A woman aged 44 with stab wounds was found at 7.55 p.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street. On suspicion of murder, a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: “The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who have been near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras could have recorded something to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation,"
A police spokesperson confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police have announced that an investigation is ongoing and are now informing relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he wasn't able to say words.
The residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to return home.
One person was told by a police officer that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, "That's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape, and another was waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the closed area who monitor the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestopers at 0800 555 111 and give the code 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament has recently become a hit over an argument over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a deserved punishment for his fanatical Puritan followers in the Taliban style destroying a lot of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history."
The chairman of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, comments: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character would become one of the goals in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconoclasm in English civil wars.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the character's historiography, which many think still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although a little less today than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of constant historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well identifiable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
A killer pig tore apart Chinese farmers
According to local media information, there was an attack and killing of a farmer by a pig on the market in southeastern China.
As the journal South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a pigsty on the market in Liu-pchan-shui in the province of Kuejzhou.
The pig breeder is preparing to inject the vaccine to pigs in the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the Chinese province of Qing-chai.
Allegedly on Wednesday, he arrived with a cousin from the next province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next pigsty was open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the barn with a mouth full of blood.
According to the information, the forensics confirmed that a 250-pound pig tore the farmers apart.
"The cousin had legs all bloody and torn," Guiyang Evening News quoted a cousin, whom he refers to as the surname "Wu".
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The Marketkeeper told the Evening News daily that the pig was closed so no one else would think of it when police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Market officials are reported to be negotiating with Yuan's family to compensate for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300kg pig pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor and drove him away until the farmer's wife.
After eating his pigs in 2012 by an Oregon farmer, a farmer from Manitoby told CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "launcher".
“They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But over the next few days, it will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the US.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached wind speeds of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km (620 km) southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure trail forms over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward to the western coast of the US. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture northwards into the southwest part of the US.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday.
Tropical humidity then, with an approaching low pressure furrow in the following days, triggers massive rains in the southwest of the US.
The 25 to 100 mm rainfall locally causes dangerous torrential flooding, debris currents, and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall to be closer to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the US, especially above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of rain is expected.
Under rapidly deteriorating conditions, torrential flooding may occur due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
Given the dangers of tropical rainfall, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become rampaging rivers, and storms bring local shock winds and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure wake will bring heavy local rainfall on some parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller currents of debris and slippery roadways.
It will be the first rainfall season in this region.
Sunday night and Monday morning, unique tropical showers begin to approach Arizona, and Monday night and Tuesday night, the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Horns and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes throughout the U.S. because the Arctic will begin to cool, but it will still be quite warm in the tropical zone.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the US on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there is a difference of nearly 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few today, it will attempt to re-extension the tingling summer heat.
In most territories on Wednesday and in the east of the US, a warm beginning of October is expected with temperatures of around 27 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeast of the US.
New York City could be 27 degrees C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation was followed by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's engaging statements of candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault reportedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and announcers interrupted routine programs with news of a sudden Friday reversal: an agreement mediated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, about the FBI conducting a one-week investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was groping her drunk at a high school party and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that the event was followed by over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen.
The company counted average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations that broadcast statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen is usually having trouble accounting people who look at offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of viewers who watch football matches in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest ratings of all stations when, according to Nielsen, an average of 5.69 million spectators watched him during a full-day hearing.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
Interest persisted even after the end of the negotiations.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras picked up on Friday morning shouting protesters at him as he was about to take an elevator to a court commission meeting.
CNN was streaming live as he stood with his eyes down for a few minutes and got his swearing.
One woman said: “I am standing right here in front of you. ”
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are helpless. ”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and he added before closing the elevator door that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later aired live when the court committee was to vote on the submission of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate by next week were investigated by the FBI, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that, without an investigation, Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politics" regarding Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview for the Sunday Times, accused critics of leaving the European Union of "politics" on Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close with the Prime Minister on the front page, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy their duties on each other was "totally senseless".
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the death of an LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a Wayde Sims shooting case, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported that Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video with a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to Sims police, he lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel belonging to CBS, police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson, according to the police, admitted after the interrogation that he shot Wayde.
According to the attorney, bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Unit, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for "singing and striving for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre assailant grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death had "shaked" the team and "shocked" him.
"This is what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ashes in Mexico City
The ashes that roll from the Popcatépetle volcano hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano, after Vulcan activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a number of roars and tremors.
On social networks, images of car windscreens covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in volcano activity located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a strength of 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Prior to the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the independence protesters clashed with the order police and thousands engaged in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote that split up Catalonia.
Orderly officers blocked off a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them. The ones on the streets, which are usually flooded by tourists, created dark clouds of dust.
There were also later skirmishes that police had to use batons to calm down.
Groups supporting independence sang in a few hours "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of protesting supporters of the Union who called "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, tensions in a region seeking independence remain high.
Voters voted largely for independence, but the turnout in the election was low because opponents of secession boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes across the region attempted to end the vote in the polls.
Groups supporting independence remained out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration took place, she had to choose a different route.
An 85-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who and his wife took part in a separatist protest, said he no longer hopes to gain independence for Catalonia.
“We had some of the best moments last year.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we're at an impasse," he said.
Despite the important, although close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence-supporting parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their best-known leaders either went into exile themselves, or wait in custody for their part in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old fitter Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone, saying that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting in prison for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament.
"The candidateship in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after car crash into the house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were imprisoned after driving repeatedly into a house in Londonderry.
The event happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone fired a crossbow at the car.
Meng's shot secured Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and awarded Steven Gerrard only a second defeat of 18 matches as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team does not yet have a victory on the guest field in the Premiership League this season, and next Sunday they will face the first Hearts, on which they lose eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston expanded a number of undefeated matches in the division to six matches, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston didn't take a chance against bland guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, as his directness caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated defense, but failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow in slippage just narrowly missed Craig Halkett's head before the goal.
All the landlords had to do was watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could torment the guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers, a free kick was ordered, and Livingston formed a loophole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent out Menga, which ball in the middle of the penalty area flowed and scored.
At this stage the Rangers dominated in possession of the ball, but the home defense for them was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly did not have much work to do.
The same picture of the game was also at the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers Allan McGregor's legs, and Lithgow missed another standard Livingston situation.
Centres were constantly flying into Livingston's fine territory, which players kept cleaning, and two penalty kicks came in vain – after Halkett's attack on alternate Glenn Middleton and another one by the hand.
"The Phenomenon" from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and continue to overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team has hardly changed since returning to the top, but a great praise deserves Holt for how he has stirred up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was tremendous, leading a well-ordered defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby all the time.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they're no longer up to these standards.
Their ending was lame – only once penetrated the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are located in the middle of a table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September), the sky was blue and everyone smiled.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of topics, including human rights, freedom of the press and the admission of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this city, the largest Turkish population is outside Turkey.
Police for security reasons prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting outside the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them Kurds – were also heard against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Contradictive protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks hailed as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Accident in Deptford: A cyclist died after a car collision
A cyclist died in London after a car crash.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with the busy Evelyn Street street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead at the scene.
The death occurred only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the site of Saturday's tragedy in an accident on Childers Street when the driver left the site.
Metropolitan Police said police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in the riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in riots in a high security male prison.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still persist.
To cope with the riots involving eight prisoners in the same wing, specialized overseers from the “Tornado” team were called up.
Peacekeepers suffered minor injuries and were treated on site.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were deployed to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six personnel have been treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer time behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June it was announced that the director of the prison ended up following an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
And last October, order forces were called to prison due to serious riots in which the staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (a dry area may benefit)
It is not usual for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low pressure wake, but this is probably exactly what happens at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning on Mondays and Tuesdays from Western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
According to the National Weather Service in Phoenix on Twitter, “only ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm status or pressure below within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona in places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local aggregates of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by torrential flooding, the rain may be a blessing to Rosa, as drought struck the area.
Floods are a very serious thing, but perhaps these rainfalls will help somewhere, because the southwest of the US has just hit drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor service, the server weather.com reports that more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing “extreme drought” which is the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa's journey will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still on the hurricane force with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning it will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and thus loses its strength.
They are expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall will be strong, which poses a great risk of flooding.
"A total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected in the area from Baja California to northwest Sonor, with up to 250 mm likely to occur," reports weather.com.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico north and arrives on Tuesday morning at the Arizona border, then passes through Arizona and enters southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the desert southwest of the US," the National Center for Hurricanes reports.
These rains are expected to cause fatally dangerous floods and currents of debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area at Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As reported by police from Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Cops are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "tasteed wickedness and rage" of the Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the unscrupulous and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had "tasteed wickedness and rage" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he decisively and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she was sexually assaulted a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing about her accusations, Ford testified.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the Americans were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliance and quality and courage.”
A representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that "a voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the finest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with excellent public service in his accounts".
The President was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of how important it was for Republicans to participate in the mid-term election.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump stated that Democrats opted for "resistance and obstruction".
The Republican Party leadership advisor told CNN Station that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of casualties is still increasing
Authorities announced on Saturday that after an extensive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which swept away the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people met on the beach in the city of Pal on Friday at the festival. At dusk, however, the coast hit up to six meters of waves that killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they fell to the waves as a victim," said a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugro at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave did not go alone, taking cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami wave on the open sea spread at a speed of 800 km/h.
He stated that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city even on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday's strong shocks was approximately 200 times greater than the atomic bomb force dropped during World War II on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have increased the tsunami wave even further.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said there was a collapse of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found wedged under the debris of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho informed that the amount of casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, communication was "totally paralyzed without any information" from Donggala.
The Red Cross stated in its statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected sites.
"It's tragic, but it could get a lot worse," the statement states.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not inform that Palu had been hit by a tsunami wave, although authorities reported that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building screaming desperately warning people on the street from the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the coast hits a water wall that carries buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami waves caused a large power outage that cut off communications in the vicinity of Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
According to authorities, the military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for aid transport and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Saturday.
The number of tsunami casualties in Indonesia has climbed to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paul, where employees were hiding in cell shelters built in the yard of an office building, they saw images of destruction, says Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When the relief groups began a sad disaster relief activity, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies, and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow to the site of calamity when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," says the spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross Aulia Arriani.
"Once the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start international aid, but it is not yet like this."
When the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paul, friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be those miracles that lighten the bleak stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was trapped under the wreckage next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that finished in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon recounted how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Hotel Roa Roa, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, instead of a pair of blue checkers, ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 during an ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport Police Department press release, thieves estranged $26,750 to a Brink employee on Friday morning while replenishing an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
While doing this, another man “runs from behind a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money to be put into an ATM.
According to a press release, Witnesses saw several suspicious persons fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
Inform Newport Police at 859-292-3680, if any, of the identity of suspects.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter Saturday, where he wrote: “The estate formally known as Kanye West. ”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and the pseudonym used as the name of its eighth album, which was released in June.
Change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album Yandhi.
The show will be replaced by singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "citizen reasons", as stated by the show's creator.
West had previously said that in addition to shortening the current professional name, the word has religious significance.
"In my opinion, "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," West let himself be heard earlier this year when he spoke to Big Boy about his album radio host.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye—as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
A number of other famous rappers changed their name.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West's associate JAY-Z also alternately wrote his name with and without the link and without it and in both large and small letters.
Mexican president AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the approaching 50th anniversary of the bloody intervention against students, Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatellolco Plaza that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting at people on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying, and by opening other free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education drag young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
According to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published announcements about AI, although the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced a plan last year, according to which it wants to be number one in AI innovations by 2030.
"A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are much further than the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee stated this week in an interview for CNBC that doubling funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the AI area would be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “Superpower AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that surpassed the best American player in the game Othello, and later was a senior researcher at Microsoft and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee praised the previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when he would be next to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
"Academic tops are not done by China, but by corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have employed the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help to improve efforts in the AI area.
"I think that the holders of a doctorate in AI should automatically be offered green cards," he says.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation's Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar manner to the National Science Council and other government organizations donating money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage partners in the industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of a Selection Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it was investing USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF Foundation is concerned, it now invests more than USD 100 million a year in AI research.
However, US legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonia's people voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, blocking applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of the electorate needed would come along to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the successor countries of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote.
A name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission stated that no problems were reported within 13 hours.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters eventually cast their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, sets a small stage and pulls out chairs in front of tents built by people who are boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the door for servants," Kavadarkov says.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, the result of "yes" would be "confirming our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, referendums could take part between 30 and 43 percent of voters – less than the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by the Macedonian station Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, 50 percent plus one voter must participate.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy since its onset last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City came for a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling tackled the defense of Brighton on Saturday, securing Manchester City's 2–0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguera's submission, his goal looked ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
It all started with a pass that Argentine striker got in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenders and got into open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's fine territory, one defender bypassed and several others overcame.
Next pass to the left, he found Sterling.
The English striker nailed the ball in the penalty area back to Aguero, who, with his right hand, overcame the goalkeeper Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," City manager Pep Guardiola announced to reporters.
“We said he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match was arranged by Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
On his left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote pole.
Attacker Sky Blues dropped the ball into the net just before it slipped off the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies' joy
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs fight, there were not many reasons to re-enter.
But the ever-competing Scherzer hopes to take the place of a pitcher in a match against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday – but only if they have Rockies, who lead in NL West for one match over the Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5–2 over the Nationals, but still want to earn their first title in the division.
“Even if we're not playing for anything, we can at least play games, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the other team will play with the greatest effort I can experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reported to be leaning towards pitching Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer it would be the 34th start. Thursday he trained and pitched on Sunday, when he usually has the day off.
The right-handed pitcher Washington has a 18-7 statistics this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump performed at a rally in West Virginia
The President spoke indirectly about the situation surrounding his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when talking about how important it is for Republicans to participate in the mid-term election.
“In November everything we have done will be at stake.
One of the most important choices of our lives leaves five weeks.
It's one of the big, big – I don't run, but we're still on the move and I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the abomination.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they have to beat to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
According to him, Democrats opted for "resistance and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying, "the Democrats are angry and mean and repulsive and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to the loud mooing of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you bring out the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh no, wait—that was really bad body language—the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse opinion stream.
He is intolerant to those who express their views
When Momento activists in my local party voted for my warning, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to whom they have told that they are not welcome – because they have expressed their opinion honestly.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in a reminder for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar matters on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday’s meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East said that “we want meetings to be open and productive. ”
Most of the eight years I was a local member of parliament for the Labour Party were GC meetings on Friday night exactly like that.
Unfortunately, most meetings do not take place these days, and the promise of a "loving, kinder" policy has long since been forgotten if it has ever begun with it.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is assessed whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues, who I had previously thought had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and hold positions with which I could otherwise not agree – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then there is a tirade of swearing on social networks where they call for my appeal, they condemn Wednesday politics and tell me I shouldn't be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face a rush of sexist or racist insults every day, but never budge.
One aspect of this era of politics, from which I am most disappointed, is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse opinion stream, and with every motion to express distrust or to change the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I've been advised many times to stay back, not to talk so much, and then "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student of the school 32 years ago, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those in need – whether as a local councillor or Minister of Government – since Margaret Thatcher, who had left my general school class literally to fall apart.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that, when the country penetrates Brexit, which harms households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not addressed to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting on what is in my opinion the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
The two late fives distorted the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they're at the forefront of the table, the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of the chances that helped the home win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"In our matches we have passed great tests and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All the honor of Ayru, they took a better chance than we do. ”
Five Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the number superiority and Jason Baggot won the untransformed five.
Climo increased Ayru's lead by penalty and then scored at exactly halftime and turned the solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17–5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and five Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground on the stretchers, and when the game started again, Ayr jumped again thanks to five Stafford McDowall, which he transformed by Climo.
Acting captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose again used the extra player thanks to the untransformed five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
However, the landlords returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clim without the ball, MacPherson of penalty lineup laid the ball behind the advancing Ayra maul.
Climo transformed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent the winger Gregor Henry for the fifth five home cooks.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry, and it has been found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Sixty-six-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes and in which he plays along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the final series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the extract from the official register, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the report, but the source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to engage in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The Sea Is Ours": Inland Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol outside Naval Command in La Paz, which is decorated with rope.
A blue flag in the color of the ocean flies above public buildings.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to get it."
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country has lost in favor of Chile in the blood war on resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to traverse the Pacific Ocean again.
These desires may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has energy, spirit of unity and calm and, of course, expects a positive outcome," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD's decision on large screens across the country with the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that – after many decades of interrupted talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate that Bolivia will provide sovereign access to the sea.
The charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial re-election battle ahead of him next year – is also very interested in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely for the court to rule in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, power would not change.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that MSD's decision comes only six months after the latest arguments have been made shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't only supported the Bolivia thing, but maybe they've slowed it down.
"Questions of access to the sea were seized by the existing Bolivian government," Zarate says.
He adds that Morales' offensive rhetoric weakened all remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will act again one day, but after this it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia a "exceptional opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the US can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to make promises given to the summit of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which is stuck at a deadlock, for more than three months for the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a “flame of hope” that ongoing sanctions and US objections against a declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about consenting to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
Of course, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that your fashion shops will soon arrive with the latest trend of huge headcovers
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a number of crazy giant headcovers for their spring/summer 2019 collections at a show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creations to the piers.
The exhibition piece by Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge reminiscent of feathers that flooded the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories were adorned melons, witch hats, and even pineapples – but are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with great fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could even arrive at fashion stores.
The oversized hats come after the "La Bomb", a strawneck with a half-metre wide cremation, which was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded social media, sent another huge creation to the show piers – a straw beach bag that is almost the same size as a swimsuit model carrying it.
A dark orange raft bag lined with raffio fringes and equipped with a handle made of white leather on the Paris Fashion Week was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said for FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the next summer – given the designer’s success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for excessively large supplements."
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have had a number of academic achievements, and this continues in 2018 with other outstanding test results. Individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other community activities only underline this.
These schools have over 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and are trying to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible service levels.
Independent schools are preparing their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes right to his head.
If you speak his own language to him, it goes straight to his heart."
It is an important observation that if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year's exams show that languages are at the top of the tables, with independent schools having the highest success rate.
In total, 68 percent of pupils learning a foreign language achieved the best A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest grade A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects chosen by pupils are as esteemed as STEM subjects (sciences, technologies, technical fields and mathematics) in the study plans of independent and other schools.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the lack of language skills are due to the problems that employers call job vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaking more languages automatically gains an advantage over competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them failed to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, namely 15%.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for Great Britain in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have several languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to ensuring the educational environment that children prepare and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever they are in the future.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this selection, diversity, and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will introduce himself in the Lakers jersey for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James's first step behind the Los Angeles Lakers are about to arrive.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday opening game of the preseason in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
But it is not yet clear how many minutes will take place.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's appearance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaigning in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Due to the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term election, as Republicans stand at the risk of losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump's performance start tonight, and how can you track him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 eastern time, today on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be watched online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing the candidate for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court this week, and he was very tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it is expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be postponed for a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help the Republicans pick up the pace before the November election.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers President Trump say that these five rallies next week aim to “supplie energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"Senate control is so important for his agenda that the president will go as many states as possible in this busy season," said a spokesperson for Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News radio station, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could come to a meeting tonight in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, and he could be followed by media from Pittsburgh.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey who lags behind in the polls.
"For Morriseye, it is not a good sign that the President must come to help him in the polls," says a political scientist from Westovirgin University Simon Haeder, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA team showed that it has a stomach to fight to keep its hopes up before Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday's couples can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
A swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe him, and most of all at such competitions.
So where does the pendulum go now?
"They took six points and now it's four, so we take it that the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, it leads by four points, and there are twelve left.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly in the transition from batting ground to green and follows an example.
Celebratory screams intensified in the sequel of his round when he mastered the key heel to win the whole match when he and Tomas were two holes behind.
His putt, who won them a match on 15 holes, met with a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
This is all that each of these players left.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undeniably the main story of Ryder cup.
Strange but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but missed Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning again."
The course and the way the energy flows towards both the tumultuous audience and from it confirms that these are players destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sundown over Le Golf Naitional there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both on a different hole at the same time.
But talk of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcíe, the hero of the morning game of four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The hole and two dables on the front nine buried the Spaniard and Swede into a abyss from which they no longer climbed.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of it.
The games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely watch interactions of people in pairs, advice they give each other, advice they don't give each other, and the way strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the last day, but this game of two couples has also shown that the US team has a stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
By the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads by scoring 10-6 points
Europe gets a healthy advantage by the last day of Ryder Cup then from Saturday's games pairs to two balls came out with a head start of 10–6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly almost won twice over the struggling Tiger Woods, determined to make four notches at Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to retain the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games on two balls with the American side that failed in the 3-1 series.
The US showed more resistance in four, winning two matches, but could not reach the deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend received the nickname "Molliwood", are only the second pair to win four points out of their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed players in a game of two balls, even then smoothly defeated tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5&4.
Woods, who stretched out two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in a pair game to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a morning game of two balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a pair game to a 2&1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
However, Europe did not have it on this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris won on the whole line.
Three-time lead winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas ripped off two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a game of two balls and returned later to defeat the pair Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a game of pairs, despite losing two first holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a double game, although as the defending Fury's side only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After being the best in two days the next day seems to be Sunday's counterattack behind them.
North Korea says that "no way" is unarmed unilaterally and without confidence
The North Korea Foreign Minister said on Saturday that continued UN sanctions deepened their mistrust of the United States, and under such circumstances, the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible to unilaterally disarm itself."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "progressive" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every gradual step, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization just because Pyongyang had gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim undertook to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump pledged guarantees of security to North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950–53 war conflict, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the calls to release harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“U.S. insists on “denuclearization first” and increases pressure on sanctions to force their targets and even object to “declaration of the end of the war”, Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the U.S. had been a party to this question of denuclearization, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on US territory was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump, which threatened "total destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take action to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea was completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, stating: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn’t matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without ceasing until we are fully aware of the complete, final, verified denuclearization”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suppress the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly party, and Pompeo stated that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and stated that progress had been made, only to be declared within hours by North Korea to have made “gangster demands” about him.
North Korea pledged to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “corresponding measures.”
He stated that Kim had announced to him that the “corresponding measures” he hoped for were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and was heading towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year prompted all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho studios throughout the night when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics found that students at the world's most famous university are often clueless when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and women's hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after lecturing on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she said for The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students basic information on how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's medical services, said that the university decided to establish a course after finding that students were really unsleeping within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of student dormitories, where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books on the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance is influenced by the lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another part, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in "studying all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and ever-growing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
Enough sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" student to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation switches the brain into a hunger mode, so that one is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes graduated last year during her first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push on the course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended students to consider setting the alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that may upset your circadian rhythm, leading to falling asleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goal sunk Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's discontent with defeating 1–0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox party tried to record its first victory from 4 to 1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' lineup seemed uninspiring and determined to settle.
While Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and right behind the Hibernian team as opposed to one wicket.
And there could be other Rangers problems after a bar referee Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side that swept past Ayr into the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would be pleased as his well-trained men choked their opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have taken possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after the start when Meng first let Scott Pittman on goal Allan McGregor, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
The long free kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try in the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that there would be more hope in the last third than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a penalty for a quarter-hour track when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson swept the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots at the finish in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by the header from Lassana Coulibala and tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener after 34 minutes could have been against running the game, no one can deny they deserved it for the hard work.
The Rangers again failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga to an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost an immediate result when the wing plunged into Morelosa, but impressive Kelly fought his way from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkettt metalli one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran off the corner.
Alternate Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to punishment when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still increasing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter Science Stander also became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly improbable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What on earth is this? ”
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms effluent by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: “Oh, yeah, now he's really cracking up! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then rivet again injected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells has been missing ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can "see" the protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-injected into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said, "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “controls the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and "teached" them to focus on cancer cells, had already been promoted in leukemia treatment.
Kanye West took part in a pro-Trump sermon, in his maga cap, following his performance on the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in Saturday Night Live's studio after a confused performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began spitting at Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, “How can you like Trump, for he is a racist? ”
If I had bothered with racism, I wouldn't have been in America any more," he said.
SNL launched a show of parody with Matt Damon in a lead role in which Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the rape charge of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was recorded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to viewers that he was able to eat his head off behind the scenes.
“I was bullied backstage.
They said, "Don't go with that hat."
It's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place", said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the wrong place? ” and added that he would “put on his Superman suit because that means you can’t say what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only earned the buzzing audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL looked offended, embarrassed, says Variety, and one person even said, "The whole studio has become completely quiet."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: Thank you for building DAVU."
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was simply who he is, and that is absolutely amazing."
“But I DON’T WANT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’), which I believe represents and sends to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us," she added.
Prior to the performance, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to symbol and then artist previously known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man in a restaurant in East Belfast was killed on Friday.
The incident occurred at Ballyhackamore, said police.
The defendant should stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The charges raised will be reviewed by the State's Attorney.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington embarked on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
The actor, 31, however, stepped out of the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be claimed to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the #MeToo toxic masculinity problem.
Kit, who recently married his star of the Rose Leslie thrones, also 31, admitted that he was “quite strong” on the problem.
"At this point I personally feel, quite strongly - what happened so bad with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenage men about the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic malehood due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What do guys learn on TV, on the streets, they make them feel like they need every man to have such a side of himself?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change that?
Because a young man has certainly changed for the worse.
In an interview he also admitted not to play in any prequel or sequel Games of Thrones after the completion of the series, because he has had enough "fights and horses".
As of November, Kit will play in the restored Right West Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife while filming the series, so he gave me my future family and my whole subsequent life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series awarded the Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, according to official numbers, over 820,000 people are affected by this virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, reported by Chinese paramedics at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year on year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70%-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would let the GOP Senators' data slip away, flinging the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. MP Maxine Waters denounced the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data to three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikistranks of the legislature.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were supported by "ultra-right" scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in her Twitter statement.
Released information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information appeared on Thursday on the Internet and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on sexual abuse charges by candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which sources of contributions, is linked to Waters office and published information about Waters personnel members, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress".
If someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the applicant.
He must be calm and not get excited."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrat criticism towards Judge Kavanaugh, whom they criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his ideas on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something", tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had drawn attention to “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities in criminal proceedings for these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British tendency, which seems to be the case with this revival of Johnny English in the series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this cheeky satire be on the subject of how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this bulging, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to screw things up in a whole new way - that name more than anything else by signaling that it is a broad comical work intended for an unEnglish speaking cinematographic audience.
Of course, he's the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean, and a big piece of that guy who cast a single tone in the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and international mystery man who Atkinson once played in already forgotten TV commercials by Barclaycard, and who has left chaos behind.
In this last issue of JE, one or two nice moments will be found.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blade briefly dinged his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite undersized and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like intended for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy tramps are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's person.
The permanent current assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
The cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of an agent on duty - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and biased figure who already suffers from a complete breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson plays this would-be Theresa May character as best as possible, but there is no power in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that once every active spy of hers is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director at some luxury facility, is also passing on record lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, as English offers a spy academy similar to School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long suffering partner Bough, who was played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affectated figure that Vicki Pepperdine may even be wasting a little time on.
So Batman and Robin are back in action to pack her Majesty's secret service assignments and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously succumbs to the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of frackish patalia: masked as waiters sets fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto board Volt's luxury yachts; and English triggers pure anarchy when they try using virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
All aces are definitely ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and turbulent it is, it has something in it from children's television.
It's a rather moderate matter.
And as with other Johnny English films, I could not imagine: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies developing a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to pass on savings to workers that result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
The staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would "go well" on the party's economic agenda and plan to tilt the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to use changing economies.
A long-term Labour member stated for the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits the party's attitudes towards balancing the economy for both the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party pledged a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not our party's policy and the party does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell has stated that he is committed to returning energy from "anonymous directors" and "experts" in utilitarian companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return to their total share, because the Labour government could carry out "aggressions" on the basis of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on corporate boards and to create own-ownership funds that will pass 10% of private equity to employees entitled to pay annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said "60 Minutes" on the show, whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might have changed their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the Office's findings could swing some Republican senators into dragging their support.
In an interview from Sunday's "60 Minutes", Correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to a hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charge came out, and he said, “Did you do it? ”
He was determined, determined, definite."
Graham's decision, however, is unshakable.
"I've already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh and it would mean a very explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hard," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the names she appointed could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival's annual music event will take place in New York, offering a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival in its seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people meeting in Central Park to enjoy not only such artists as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was featured in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to promote poverty cessation by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (if you were unwilling to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, email to the world leader, phone calls or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really in a way that convinces them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet will change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded over 19 million “actions” by his supporters, seeking to achieve different goals.
He says that these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures of over $37 billion to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that hedged funds still have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and realistors who committed themselves to “help children grow to their full potential,” promising Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of British government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make only a note in history of social injustice in the form of malnutrition," Ambassador to the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman project told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions that called on U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project to reach out to 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global citzen replied: “It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the anti-partheid movement, we will succeed before us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers of this year's New York year, who will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy for a “blockage” that would prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington may "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from invading markets including the Middle East, revealing U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to convey energy as much as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"United States have the opportunity, with the help of our Navy, to make sure that maritime routes are open and blocked if necessary, to make sure their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke approached participants in an event organized by the consumer energy alliance, a non-profit group that is considered a "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are virtually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "single-purpose" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes because Trump's administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which has a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "a hostage" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s keen opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a position from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "closely look" at the 2020 presidential candidacy, says a Massachusetts senator
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the mid-term election, she would "closely look" at the candidacy for president.
During a meeting of the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the top female position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will look closely at the presidential candidacy."
Warren mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that she “leads this country in the wrong direction.”
"I fear to the core the bones of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts stated that the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against her.
Other high-ranking Democratic names mentioned in connection with the potential candidacy by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, stating the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq following the listing in September.
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may concern other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries with which our soldiers are returning," she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “a elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that“ they return a little different, return toughened, return and ask if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen, and any other member of the army, give their country.
He was arrested Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violent assault on a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while drunk, reported Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal call for new US government measures that deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from eighteen states and districts on Friday in Washington issued a short report on Friday to support asylum seekers and to challenge this measure, NBC reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal policy in August, was not revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang” abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys of states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing ubiquitous gang and domestic violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the US reversed the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeal for immigrants, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. stated in Friday's statement that the new measures "ignor the decade of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," a short friend said.
Advocates continued to argue briefly that a policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the US economy and says that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence as early as June.
"Azyl is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his statement of 11 June.
Asylum never intended to alleviate all problems - not even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the number of casualties has already risen twice, race to find survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish little boy at the evacuation center in the parched city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance will bring more bodies.
Pure water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, choosing through drenched things and trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were paralyzed.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a spinal and shoulder fracture, rested at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued strong subsequent tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the feeling that a violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Haris said for the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry out for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page ad in the American daily dedicated to mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday a paid bonus to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state of the largest sales newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to mix into the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was attempting to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase of the escalating campaign by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that manifests itself at the level of mutual imports.
China's retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to intervene exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American valuable tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast to the newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic path, given that the media belongs to the company “Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish the offer" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans leave their voters to vote for Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn
As many top Republicans advocate for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaug, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that they would see a response during the upcoming midterm election, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue the vote.
These things cannot be put back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute to pursue an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Counsellor and Speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November approaches!" at a demonstration in the senate hallway, where Republicans in charge of the judicial commission decided to name Kavanaugh despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic stated.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will tear records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's been high, that's right."
However, it could be higher, especially between female female shesitant voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed, resistance might follow.
"It became a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chairman, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the table, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, U.S. priority director, a group that helps vote Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans look somewhat divided in the opinion of whom to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent reported that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent reported that they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at the party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web network plans to start a new Internet and outrun Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the goal of Project Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all simultaneously.
What is exceptional about a personal online data repository is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
Society calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to the CEO of John Bruce, to bring resources, processes and corresponding skills to help Solid platform to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some employees working on the project collaborated on the project and community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google don’t talk about making a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his contribution to the medium published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in discussing net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the site," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of the clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during World War I
Celebrations have taken place for hundreds of years since the only clergy of the Church of England won Victoria's cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never knew that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandsons revealed him a memorial stone at the Rushden parade on Saturday, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “genitally symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victory.
According to London Gazette magazine on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Lt Col Vann led his batalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very thick fog and strong shooting from field guns and machine guns."
He later made it to the front line and with "highest courage" led the line forward before throwing himself separately into the firing field and knocking out three separated units.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann after the show, led by the youth group Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he “felt a great honor to participate in the show, ” adding that “the valor of the true hero is manifested by the support provided by a lot of people. ”
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Piggy Peppa
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the bloated Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The San José receipt contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a mutual match, viewers in the UK remained amazed when the news changed to the Peppa Pig show.
Some remained unexcited after waking up to early morning hours for the match.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in the show for children as “a sure form of a bad joke.”
"According to government regulations, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children's shows," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communication of Bellator after being asked for this transmission.
"Peppa the Puppa", yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on the program so that audiences in the UK would be involved in the future.
"I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it," Cooker said.
“But there is six o’clock on Sunday and we can’t make it by Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We reduce it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and tried with all our strength to keep the promise given to fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less valuable" because of sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to follow success.
A 24-year-old athlete reported that he did not realize until he entered high school that “not all are like him. ”
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hopes."
He also said that due to the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-term show Kirsty Young had a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a survivor in Laverno's first program, stated that he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: “Up until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherwise were real things that gave me strength and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone", said not to disappoint anyone who would eventually find out what happened to his sexuality.
The two-time Bronze Olympic medal holder became a LGBT rights fighter with a high profile and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called in because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others “hopes.”
This three-time world champion stated that falling in love with a man—the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013—was “affected unprepared."
Daley took the Oscar holder, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later of cancer – he said it was not easy to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said that he had "changed his whole perspective".
"If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of "I want to get a gold medal", he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't agree to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in front of the ranks.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
A year later, Daley attended the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life – jumping in front of our pets at the Olympic Games, I don't feel better," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first track – a stream by Heather Small – that resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.

Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson would have reached the record on Sunday when he played the 47, the Ryder Cup match, but would have to tune the form to prevent it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played on events held every two years by a record of the twelfth time, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's courballs and coursoms to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as often used to be in the US, the five-time main winner spent his day alternately between cheerleaders and working on a game in a row he hoped to correct what troubled him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, not even at the top of his career, so he is not the ideal choice for a narrow field of Le Golf National, where long rugged terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course itself is not worrying enough, Mickelson faces the exact British Open Francescu Molinari champion in the ninth Sunday match, who won all four of his matches on the team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If Americans, who had four points less, had launched 12 separate swords, had escaped the rapid onset, Mickelson's mač could have proved absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and added nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, patted me on the back, put his hand around my shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“They believe in each other so much.
He is a member of the Hall of Straw, and in the past this week he has been so beneficial to these teams.
I guess I just couldn't imagine two machos playing.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Fald's record in most of the Ryder Cup Wests played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson reached 18 wins, 20 losses and seven drawes, although Furyk says his presence of the team brought some intangible results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the fun of going to see him this week, which was fun to observe.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a large lead directed to the singles of the last days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 game in Valderrama, where the squad led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they made it to the finish line by a completely tight win 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You must always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only narrowly," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching when they won 5–3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10–6 in 2018.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it wasn't over.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have a target, and that's how we try to get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased with how his players did on a complex golf course, added: “I could never do it on my own.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
They're preparing individual performances tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with your partner when it's going well, but when you're there on your own, your golf player capacity is fully vetted.
That's the message you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will take care of making his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these major twists when he was part of the winning team at Brooklin to then end up being a loser when Europe reached "The Miracle in Medinah".
"I remember every damn word", he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to head to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklin, as in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts considerable pressure on those middle matches.
According to this, we set up a line-up and made the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to be magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead a counterattack and standing up to Rory McIlroy in a top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I went with that group of boys in that order, because I think it covers the whole journey, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
German new warship postponed again
The most recent German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and snowy coasts, reports local media.
The launch of the leading ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a brand new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit's citing military spokesman.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but challenging problems after delivery made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will serve as replacements for the aging frigates of the Bremen-class.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the top sea ships – which were reportedly supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time they were put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate made it to the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel in service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after the handover.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of major "software errors and faults on metal elements" glitches that would make the warship useless when deployed to combat.
Software glitches were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel will operate a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the workers needed on the Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a considerable overweight, reducing its performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfal ship will be twice as heavy as the class-like ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides defects in metal elements, the price of the entire project – including crew training – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euro, the price has climbed to a staggering 3.1 billion euro.
Problems with the latest frigates have become significant, particularly in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, confirmed that the naval army was indeed “running out of ships capable of deployment."
This representative stated that the problems were constantly being packed as the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacements were provided.
Lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are capable of becoming part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust organization listens to the secret life of bats
A new research is being conducted at the habitat of bats in the Highlands of Scotland to reveal how bats use the landscape in hunting food.
There is hope that research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help to manage future activities for conservation of this species.
A study conducted by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland Association will be followed by bats whistling and smallest and brown long and watery in the Inverewe Gardens Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas in this bat settlement, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of calling bats and what individual species do.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a report will be released to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and best practice in maintaining wooded areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain are shrinking greatly in the last century.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials, as well as cat attacks, may also pose a risk.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful in hunting prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, colony controls, and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even established the first and only reserved bat reservation at the Threeve housing estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson states that this is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Three we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and best habitats.
But there's too much we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand better what they need for survival."
It emphasizes the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages the public to put their hands to work and help.
She said: “There is much more to be learned about our bats and many species that we do not know about how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape charges "false reports," stating that people "want to make themselves visible" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who informed of these allegations.
This Portuguese and assailant for Juventus was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Reportedly, he subsequently paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, informing the daily Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of information on the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million watching and labeled the information "false news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time Golden Ball Award winner for the camera.
“They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are about to accuse Der Spiegel of unfounded charges that they called "unacceptable announcement of suspicion in the private area".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage equivalent to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights lately."
The alleged incident was to occur in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suite and in the casino in Las Vegas.
Following a night club introduction, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the arcade, where she was reportedly raped as a result of documentation filed in Clark County District Court's court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her that he was a “99 percent” “klaďas” and failed to “one percent”.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "feared of retaliation" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to retrial because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronald at the time of the charge of attacking one step away from the transfer to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer he was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain will forever regret losing car manufacturers
Great Britain “will forever regret” if, after Brexit, it loses its world leader status in car production, Secretary for Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that the car manufacturer Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"Agreement is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker stated that the impact of border delays in the absence of a Brexit agreement could cost jobs.
At the Burnaston plant, where Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured by Toyota – they produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have seen production halted at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, the BMW states that it will close its Mini car production plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what producers refer to as risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on the basis of deliveries ‘just in time’, with parts from suppliers in both the UK and the EU delivered for cars manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If Great Britain left the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be border disruption, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, said the company, and thus would stop production.
Mr Clark stated that Theresa May's plans to revive future relations with the EU are “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
“We need an agreement. We want the best trade that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the grasp of this opportunity,” he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run it warns that added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in the Burnaston race for 24 years and is chairman of the union in the race, said that the members of the union are becoming increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places have ceased, they will never return.
The government spokesman stated: “We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's encounter with Rosenstein may be delayed again, reports the White House
Meeting Donald Trump at a high level with Acting Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "delegated for another week", as he continues to fight for the position of Chief Justice with Brett Kavanaugh, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller's Special Council, which examines interference with Russian elections, ties between Trump's aides and Russia and possible judicial obstructions by the President.
Whether Trump releases the acting general agent and threatens Mueller's independence, Washington rumors have been feeding on it for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposed the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York City at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump stated that he would not "likely" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judicial Committee hearings where they filed witness statements from Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI a weekly investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox Channel news on Sunday.
Upon asking for a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may be this week, but it may be necessary to move another week with regard to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I will always communicate current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders stated that too few press conferences were not due to an aversion to the "theatre" of television reporters, although she said, "I disagree with the fact that they will perform."
She subsequently suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without providing evidence. "We looked at the numbers."
The conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly have been better than talking to me.
We are trying and you have seen that we have been doing this in the last few weeks and that there will be press conferences where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why, with his loose and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled reporters.
The health minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to avoid fear of Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU employees working in NHS, Scotland, to express their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to SMEs less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to settling the costs of requests for the state of settlement of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between Great Britain and the EU continue to distance themselves, and they move towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible scenario of distance without agreement.
I know this must be a very upsetting time for all of you.
That's why I want to reassure you how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our fervent wish is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie progresses emergency surgery after head injury
The dropped defender of the Tigers from the state of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie advanced an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines and then put him on the stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
A Tennessee state official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had advanced surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details about the type/range of injuries” are yet available and that the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, sophomore in red shirt, completes the first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five total procedures, meaning a total of 18 operations in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when purchasing real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy a property in the UK, with extra money being used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters
The increase in the obligation of higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state treasury is expected to increase by £120 million a year – to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they purchase a property in the UK, with extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announces today.
This act will be called an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property purchase tax will relate to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the money will additionally strengthen the government's efforts to combat sleeping without a roof over its head.
The surcharge, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay property purchase tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago at other houses and the purchase for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury is expected to increase funds by up to £120 million a year.
Estimates say that 13 percent of non-UK residents buy newly built properties in London, which expels prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the ladder.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spirit cities" precisely because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
New principles only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property purchase tax to help more young people to their own first house.
He accused large construction firms of holding property prices high by occupying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to correct the “favor of home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an engaging number of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and ending the "permanent" evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my efforts as Prime Ministers to restoring the British dream – so that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and shape life.
However, it cannot be right for it to be easy for entities that do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to be able to buy houses as well as hard-working UK residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the disgrace of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross reports that it is his “highest ambition” to become a manager of Scotland at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scots enjoy the challenge of restoring the Northeast Club, which currently holds a third position in the First League, only three degrees below the summit.
This summer he switched to Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership league last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got rank B and it was," said Ross on BBC Channel Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and that’s always something that draws me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in the role of Sunderland executives were: Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic chief says he felt no anxiety about the succession of such established names at such a large club when he had previously rejected foreplays from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success would be measured for me at the time by asking if I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I'd probably feel successful if I could just put the club back there."
Ross only makes a career in charge for three years, before serving as assistant boss in Dumarton and spending 15 months as among Hearts coaches.
He then helped Club Alloa recover from descent into the third group and transformed St Mirren from beginning decline to champion title winner right the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he's ever had in his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic clubs.
"It was probably real intersections," he recalls the time when Allo took over.
“I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than acting.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money and enjoying reasonable heights.
But acting can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through a week.
I'm still going through them from the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good about being in charge.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel like in my entire adult life, I feel like I'm the most in my shoes."

Research found that the perfect time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased British pub incomes struggling with difficulties, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pub and bar groups recorded an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and longer than expected attendance by England in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June deteriorated even further in July.
Pubs and drinking bars have so far done the strongest as the restaurants have offended themselves.
Pubs whose main sales are made of food also suffered the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman of the analytical firm of leisure activities and hospitality said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has lasted since the end of April.
The weather and influence of major social or sporting events are the greatest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual drop in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing pressures on costs.
A long hot summer can't be a worse time for food-enticing business operators and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much-needed relief."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand presentation.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitor for the British sector of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, which is an established industrial benchmark in the sector.
One in five children has a secret social media account that hides from their parents
One in five children – at the age of 11 – has a secret social media account that hides from parents and educators, showing research
Research among 20,000 high school pupils showed an increase in "false Instagram sites"
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of pupils reported having a “main” account that parents know about
One in five children – at the age of 11 – creates accounts in social networks that they hide from their parents.
A survey among 20,000 high school pupils showed a rapid increase in “false Instagram accounts” in which they share photographs.
Reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they had a beautified “main” account that parents know about, and they also have a private account.
One mother who had stumbled upon her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website found that her teenage girl was urging others to “rape her. ”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools has shown that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an inexecutive director at the annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most acclaimed lightweight athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport as those for whom her far-reaching experience at international level will be useful in the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community, and we are sure that it will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland if she is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes and hope to be truly beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland. ”
An American who won a total of four gold medals at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, won a total of 200 and 400 metres, and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after the transitory ischemic atace.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I was going to get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've done a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I can handle the exercise!
Thanks for all the encouraging news!"
The milk-sucking apparition of mothers to cows divides opinions online
The company involved in the production of suctions divided online opinion by advertising that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of the marketing of the "first silent wearable suction in the world" company with consumer technologies Envi released a music video with exaggeration showing the freedom that the new suction gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows for a song with the lyrics: "Yes, I will eat, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed that I don't have udders, my breasts are here."
The choir continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk. ”
However, the advertisement that was posted on the company's Facebook page sparked online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, with many of them stating that it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
Elvie suction is applied discreetly to breast-feeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added: “The commercial is completely off. ”
There were also those who defended the advertisement, while one woman admitted that she considered the track “infectious.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breast-feeding.
Suction makes me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but it's a good thing.
It is a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another added: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who suck milk (often at work or toilet) and feel like “cows.”
It is not an advertisement to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet suctions hidden under a bra.
The concept behind campaigns is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's suction machine is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and hides beautifully in a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold a child and even walk while suctioning.
Ana Balarin, a mother’s partner and ECD, added a comment: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between lactating mothers and milking cows, we wanted to point out the suckling of milk and all the challenges associated with it while showing a fun and reliable incredible feeling of freedom that the new suction will ensure.
It's not the first time Elvie's suction got into the sun.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers designer Marta Jakubowski, who had just used the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrants' children detained has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, particularly because hard rhetoric and the principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the companions were traditionally created by immigrants without documents who were afraid of endangering the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to be one of the children.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Department, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people seeking the status of escorting single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of the home of sponsors are illegally in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," said Mr.Albence.
According to asylum workers, officials have introduced new rules in an effort to process children’s affairs more quickly, requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of earlier standard 60 days.
Many appear through calls within the video conference instead of personally declaring their case to be legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who, according to the report, are not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he will develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbursts of rage or escape attempts, claims asylum workers and report from the system over the past few months.
Advocates state that these concerns are raised in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where there are indications that the child is suffering, more likely not to be noticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or farewell to friends could create trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria announced that US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” should withdraw immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also called after the return of Syrian refugees home, although there is already an eighth year of war in the country.
Moualem, who is also acting prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “it will be handled accordingly."
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terrorism in Syria was almost over,” with more than 360,000 people dying as of 2011, and millions more losing their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until we have rid of all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal strangers present."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria that predominantly train Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of a war-torn country.
In issuing refugees, Moualem stated that there were good conditions for them to return, accusing “some Western countries” of “dissembling irrational fears” that caused refugees to not want to return.
"We have approached international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They pity what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no assistance for Syria to recover until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last refuge of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russia-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces shielded by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clearly given final terms" and expressed the hope that military action would be aimed at jihadists including Nusra Front fighters with ties to Al-Qaeda who would "be exterminated."
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition, will soon take place to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning of intervention.
Why Trump will win in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won the 2020 election as well if, as many liberal observers would have hoped, the prosecution and scandals had not prematurely ended his office as president.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue.
As of 2014, ratings in major broadcasting time more than doubled to 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has average ratings of 2.4 million in prime time, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen agency and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC increased ratings on cable television to 3.5 million watching major night news.
"It's a heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designed Survivor" show on ABC's Cabinet Secretary drama that became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and show "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has a different theory.
He recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
Why? she asked
"He said, "Because he's funny," Mrs Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of having fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story of Washington could predeterminate the future of Roe v. Wada, whether immigrant families can reconnect and for the benefit of the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you are an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses "deep reserve" resources for his book "Fear," ostrich Paul Manafort's leather jackets worth $15,000 ("dressing arrogance" as Washington Post said) and the consequences of Mr Trump Storm Daniels's disgusting portrayal of "anatomy".

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny, out on the north shore of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the tightest home races of the medium-term election
It is no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania after experiencing a financial inflow due to the reorganization of congressional districts, which generated two holders of office in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the reconstruction of the suburban district of Pittsburgh by District Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who acquired a different district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another office holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17.
After the Supreme Pennsylvania Court issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th district started a fierce financial dispute between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March Special Elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump won by 20 points in the precinct.
Policy experts give the Democrats a slight lead.
America is considering fined Salvador for supporting China, subsequently retreating
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners court-imposed Trump's organizational team leadership.
State Department officials have decided to call off the U.S. director of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama on the basis of "unrecent decisions not to recognise Taiwan any more," said Department Department spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement issued early in the month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including funds to control narcotics, development, and economic support.
Proposed fines, which included shortening financial aid and focusing on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, leading officials had clarified that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively complete any fines considered for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now tasked with solving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal the administration puts on the meeting, said diplomats.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without having any new hard news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to government executive and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible obstruction of Mr Trump's exercise of law, which is now in public records, could be a definite nail to the coffin.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller is said to have turned to whether Mr Trump's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If there were an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have to take responsibility for this body, just as he is preparing to re-embark before the voters, and in the end a jury consisting of his colleagues would probably expect him.
This is a whole series of 'ifs', and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to hold a coup against Hitler, all it took was for the Western powers to stand up to him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
Americans now face several similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, here the man who manages the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's had it on since the report announced that he had secretly proposed to record the president last year and speculated that he was not in a state of health to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly demanded investigation of F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote in mid-term for Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr Trump?
If we fail these trials, democracy will have a long dark night.
But I believe we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles on a swastika table.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning over the Austrians would give them a great deal of hope of advancing from the G Group of the European League after an impressive draw in Spain on the Villarreal field earlier this month.
Knee injury prevented reservist Graham Dorrans from appearing on the field for the first time in the season until a 2–2 draw with Villarreal. However, he believes that the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went into a match with the belief that we could grab something, and we took a point.
Maybe we could reproduce it at the end, but overall, the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half, but we got better at the second half, and we were better at it.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard, because in the last game they played a good result. But with the spectators behind my back, I'm sure we can push and it'll turn out well.
Last year was pretty hard, with all my injuries and changes to the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team's strong, and the guys are really enjoying it, the training's good, too.
I hope we'll get on with it now, get over it last season and be successful."
Women are worried about their pension savings
Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people discussed this with family members.
Roughly half of the people in the national study stated that they were discussing the long-term care prize with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not willing to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: A counselor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
For example, long-term care can be financed through traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these expenses, or by your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles while you can.
Choose a healthcare representative, who will be a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate yourself.
Also consider writing up a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your accounts in case you are not eligible for it yourself.
Do not forget the minor details: Imagine that your old parent urgently needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Put these details in the written plan to be prepared.
“The game is not just about finances, but about what are the names of the treating physicians, for example?" asks Martin.
‘Where are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the aforementioned plan ready at hand."

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and authorities are expected to increase the number of casualties.
As communication is out of service, auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees.
After the outbreak of the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, and its population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary of creation when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economics of Central Sulawesi Province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggal several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami in Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Tsunami struck west Donggaly even in 1996, when she claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and earthquakes regularly occur here.
Here's a list of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in the northern part of Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and cost the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh Province.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatry at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, near Sumatra Coast.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island Java and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra and caused a tsunami at an altitude of 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost the lives of around 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic because it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami formed, but over 100 died due to falling buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intruding on reports of domestic violence, and obstructing arrest.
According to a police report, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility facility and is detained on an unsecured $500 bond, reports KTUU.
According to a network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, stating that he felt “definitely innocent ” when asked to comment.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and to a fine of up to USD 250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a one-day prison and a $2000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has to face criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently before the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence and holding a gun under the influence of narcotics in conjunction with the incident.
Allegedly, he punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by groups of war veterans when the violent behavior of her son was linked to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the son's service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake occurred on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The 7.5 degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are off-line, and in the coming days the numbers of victims are expected to rise.
The earthquake struck directly at the friction of the part of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video depicting the moment of disaster appeared on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding an exceptional death penalty for a suspect from a terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York City, in which eight people died – an exceptional sentence that has not been granted for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly carried out an attack on the bike trail along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan district using a rented Home Depot truck that he swept away pedestrians and cyclists.
To defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries – this is how the terms of the intent to grant the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court are defined.
According to the court documents, the two figures would mean the possibility of granting the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 crimes, among which were, for example, murder charges in favor of extortion, which normally federal prosecutors use in cases of organised crime, and allegations of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and preparation", claims prosecutors and describe the manner in which Saipov carried out the act, as heinous, cruel, and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damian Pagnucco," he lists himself in intent.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court last granted the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York City in 1953, when a married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who had been shown a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal regrets according to court documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the allegations, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching Islamic State videos on the phone.
Police also posted that they also demanded the flag of the Islamic State to be posted in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the plaintiffs' decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for anyone involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
According to members of the Conservative Party, he should be entrusted with the Brexit negotiations of NIGEL FARAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party Conference, Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former UK Independence Party leader stated that politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics – as proposed by one of Theresa May's own MPs, he should be conducting negotiations with the EU.
A number of Conservative MP Peter Bone stated in the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out if Mr Farage were Secretary for Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in appeasement of her ranks, where there is deep dissension, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting to stay in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her compromise plan from the Chequers running under attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the Union and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr Bone has announced that the Leave Means Leave Group will gather in Solihull, where he wanted to "screw the Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would already be out today," he said.
MEP Wellingborough added, "I stand up for Brexit, but we have to bail on the Chequers."
To show his opposition to the EU, he said, "We have not fought the world wars in order to have to listen.
In our own country we want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone has rejected the proposals that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to remain is completely misguided.'
Conservative supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: "Simply I say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and our party members and our activists, who currently fill the streets, do not like him at all.
Forget about the Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says: 'Minister chairmen will retain their seat when they keep promises.'
Mr Farage stated that conservative politicians must "get into an uncomfortable situation" if they wanted to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we stand here today to say to them, ‘We will not let you do this.’”
In a report to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
"Now we are mobilizing an army of the people of this country that has secured us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain that rules itself."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the Union marched by Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners to the Conservative against Brexit after the weekend's start of the party's operation.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the party's security application issues after the conference began.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for trouble-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"All this is a farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit,” he added.
Warren's planning to think twice about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November election, she would “think carefully about running for president".
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts has spoken about her future on Saturday at the City Hall in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting November's re-election against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could confront Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning on applying for the office of president.
Warren replied that the time had come for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government, including a woman in the highest place. ”
A suspect was arrested for shooting Sims from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had apprehended a suspect from Friday's shooting of the LSU team's basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video was released from Friday's shooting with a request to identify the man caught on tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday in the morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot head injury that was incompatible with life," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the media via 247sports website on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to moving around the scene, had a gun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was obliterated without incidents and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

The Great Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of World Champion when the team directed him to the hands of a victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday's qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team director would play a major role in the race.
From the field position, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two corners he defended his position and challenged Vettel to attack the team's partner.
Vettel drove into the depot first and had Hamilton caught up with cars circling the tail of the group, which should be decisive.
Mercedes rider drove into the depot one lap later and after the exit ranked behind Vettel. However Hamilton went forward and in close combat the Ferrari driver had to reluctantly leave the inner runway free to defend himself in the third turn after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen set off from the rear row of the field and at the end of the first round he was in charge on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race, as he held the original tires as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and could take on Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
He eventually drove to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer raise the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two seats," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's rally for insisting that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford with charges against candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at the West Virginia Assembly, he did not directly mention the statement given to Ford before the Senate Judiciary Commission, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil and repulsive and lying."
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's been happening in Senar these last days, when you see the rage, when you see these people being angry and evil and disgusting and lying," he said.
"If you look at the release and publication and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you responsible for the leak?
Remember her answer... you posted that document—oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't. "
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, that's not it," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information leaked in early September – but Feinstein refused to leak from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, nor did I publish information about the case," said Klomisi Feinstein, as told The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, her words appear to be unbelievable to the president who commented on the case at the meeting on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's definitely the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend a candidate for a Supreme Court judge charged with sexual harassment by three women, and indicated that Democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back the power by any means possible.
You see the evil, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to stomp into the country to get back to power and the helm," Mediaite quoted the President's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars fixed Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's retaliation in Dundee, which ended 5–3.
The Giants soon took the two-man lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for home before Dwyer returned the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard then straightened again behind Dundee, then two wickets Lukas Lundvald Nielsen insured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe's team, who managed to beat 2–1 on Friday in Belfast Dundee.
Both teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous matches dominated by Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at time 3:35, under assist Kendall McFaulla, while David Rutherford credited the assist to Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first period was wild when Sullivan got home back in the game in time 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared it in time 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first break after all in the lead when he recorded his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The landlords regrouped and Bouchard again managed to match the goal from the power play in time 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's joint work helped Nielsen swing the lead to Dundee's side for the first time in the game later in the second period, and the same player insured his team's leadership in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another match at home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The air traffic manager died to allow hundreds of people aboard the plane to escape the earthquake
The air traffic manager in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died as he oversaw the aircraft with hundreds of people on board safely take off.
Over 800 people perished and many are missing after the great earthquake caused by the tsunami rocked Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong subsequent tremors flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that fellow twenty-one-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung was fleeing to save his life, he refused to leave his place in a wildly ramping control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, can take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower down when he thought it was descending.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia Air Traffic Control spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, reported to the television channel Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We have prepared a transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was taken to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities have expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for dealing with the disaster stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase as many bodies still remain unscathed under the wreck and many of them still have not been reached by rescuers," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesperson.
The waves in the devastationed Palu reached a height of up to six metres. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring assistance and supplies to the affected sites.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News Station: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies here.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small stores are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the spot.
It's already tragic, but it could get even worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military forces: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" CNN Station said.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that year, in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that after a plane crash in the lagoon, one person is missing
An airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the micronesian islands in the Pacific has now stated that one person is missing, stating in the beginning that all passengers and crew numbering a total of 47 people safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that she was unable to find one traveling man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in search of a missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests to provide details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships assisted in the rescue of other passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials on Friday claimed that a total of seven persons were taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
But what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon before the landing runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had run over the runway.
U.S. passengers Bill Jaynes reported that the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that he, along with others, managed to get water down the belt deep to the emergency exits of a sinking aircraft.
He further stated that the on-board staff panicked and yelled and that he himself suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who worked nearby to modify the dock helped rescue by an inflatable boat carrying passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network states that in the last two decades, a total of 111 people have died in PNG aircraft crashes, but no crash has occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution ended its speech on Saturday in this case, in which a man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
A jury analyst sketched a screenplay of how he used cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several cell phones that demonstrated that Tellis was at Chambers's company on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous statement, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When he was shown to have spent that evening with Chambers, he noted that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford stood trial in a sobore and testified that the day in question was not in the city.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that “he is lying because my car was in Nashville that night. ”
Another disagreement was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers about two weeks on the day she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after Chambers' death Tellis deleted text messages to Chambers, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased it completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the case to be before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative views on this genre by fulfilling its music with positive messages.
The band High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has shifted from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have already seen revival in the recent past thanks to such artists as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
A NY governess sues a couple for her sacking after a "racist" text message
A New York governess sues a couple for her discriminatory sacking after receiving a misdemeanor text message from her mother, in which she was labeled "another black woman" text message.
The couple refused that they were racists and compared the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dismay when she found out on the first day of work in 2016 that the new governess of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
"NEEEÉÉÉÉÉ, EXTERNAL BLACK," wrote Pí. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Pi. Maurice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice and stated that her just leaving governess, who was African-American, had been working really badly and had been expecting Filipino instead, reported the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for sacking work and asking for compensation of US$350 for a day of six-month engagement for which they were initially hired, although without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that this is not done," the Post reported this Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
However, the pair returned the strike with the fact that they were not racists, but that ending Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after the insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, said.
“But would you place your child in the hands of someone you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened a lawsuit for "extortion" and stated that his wife cared for only a two-month-old child and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Would you be riding someone like that?
That's not a nice thing at all," said the investment banker.
Although the lawsuit still persists, the social media jury denounced the couple very quickly for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of stories about the bear Paddington feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, showing the latest news
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the rapporteur: “It is difficult to put yourself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very funny to know now that we know the great success of the bear Paddington."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, she added on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a "sweethorn" dot after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of her family, ” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he was never boastful," she said.
“But since Paddington was such a real figure to him, it was as if you had a child who achieved something you could really be proud of.
I believe he was looking at Paddington's success with that perspective.
Although it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all the accomplishments only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that she did not expect to get out of it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nado, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
So I did.
I said, “Tash, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart running slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was shut down.
I just had to sit around and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to simply keep it inside me."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers without showing what a difficult test she is going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I kept my head down, tears were running down my cheeks all the time.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight, when I felt an overwhelming understanding of Nado.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send postcards to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people may seek support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and as a result, he took his life at 18.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, stated that her son was a gifted young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could turn on every room."
However, he left work before his death because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the immobile body of his sibling after taking his life.
Says Mrs. Davis: “I am constantly worried about the effect that this will have on his life. ”
Mrs Davis proposed postcards “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Do not sit silent – you must speak."
Mrs Humphreys, who is an elderly friend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling down, or depressed, anything at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst thing on Christmas Eve – when the kids opened the presents, didn't look at them, nothing."
She stated that her partner’s death was a tremendous trauma to them, but that she needed to gradually get over it: “This kind of thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something that he was actually asking for – an investigation at a time of limitations, with limited scope – we could bring a little unity into it," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "break apart" because both sides would bury themselves after partisanism in captured positions.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The mid-term election is only five weeks away from us, November 6, and if Republicans do as expected badly, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in attempts to push their desired man to the post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush telephoned Senators, lobbied with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI sets up a report?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm at the Supreme Court.
The numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim "declined"
The numbers of refugees from North to South Korea have declined since the beginning of Kim Jong-Un's reign seven years ago, claims South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, with quoting data from the South Korean Ministry for Unification, stated that there have been 1127 escapes in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates required by border smugglers were behind this.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement.
Today, the vast majority of North refugees are getting an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border.
Most of them escape through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees and often repatriates them.
The relations between North and South – which are still technically in a state of war – have improved markedly in recent months.
In that month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on halted denuclearization negotiations.
This was the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US of making no progress on sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to be unilaterally disarmed," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that due to her temper, she was unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but wonder if any woman had ever performed such a theatre, they would have called it "hysterical", said Pelosi in her response to Kavanaugh's Thursday statement before the Senate Judiciary Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still under the age of puberty.
during his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating in dealing with his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, stating that their allegations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated attack" organised by liberals who failed to move past Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because she showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question as to whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had acquired a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you this - if she's not telling Congress the truth, then she's not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also in the court she's working on now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential returns in court in the Acceptable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because she is considered a conservative judge.
As part of hearings prior to his confirmations in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question as to whether he would reverse any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to come to trial and expect us to just say, "Oh, that's wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women must rule it.
After verbal attacks, months, and years of resentment, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who was a principal somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a certain technique, which means that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to: “Maybe you think I am crying because I am sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued to do so.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office dominated by men. I once expressed my unexpressible anger by crying. But an older, always cold manager, who was always a little worried, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up to the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to get you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illegitimate affair aboard the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea for her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“Seven other candidates have already run, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and seven Dwarfs."
But since the campaign had been running for a long time, she was unable to keep up with receiving contributions, and so she pledged not to go into the match unless she earned $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give USD 1000 to a male candidate would only give her USD 250.
"Does she think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcame by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, by frustration with a system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters rather than on delegates and out of anger over sexism, that she was completely suffocating with anger.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press responded.
“And you might think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were gonna write on my headstone.
"Was she crying?"
Why can the Chinese-American trade war be good for Beijing
The opening salva trade war between the US and China was deafening and although the battle is far from being fought, according to experts between being a rift between countries in the long term beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, provided the first warning that year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
However, most of the most significant escalations saw the light of the world this week when new tariffs were announced on goods worth USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion), which basically means taxation of half of the trade exports from China to the US.
Beijing has always responded, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion-dollar imports of US goods.
China tried to repay the US with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would kneel on its knees.
Although China would want Washington to get back on track, it would mean giving in to his demands, but public submission to American demands would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Jinping.
Despite this, experts believe that if Beijing could play his cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The reality is that the quick political decisions of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic corkscrew in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have admitted so far," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia in the Think Tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives, are now met.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored insurgents.
Europe responded decisively to the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Evria won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the U.S. Team with a final score of 16,5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field on the edge of trouble in France.
The US has now lost for the sixth consecutive time on European soil, so it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
The US star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then batted the ball into the water on a 3 par of the 16th hole and let Francesco Molinari win.
Italian golf player Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 European team players with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The highest ranked world player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who apparently graduated from his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became overall the best European player with 25,5 points earned for his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy to get the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The odd statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won the 14 greatest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The US team wrestled all weekend in an effort to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing results of his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they really fought.
We really warmed Europe up this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could be their captain.
I really have to roll.
You played us over."
Update on the Red Tide: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest Florida Fish and Wildlife commission report points to the overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC's communications, stains of flowering water are now reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – this suggests a diminishing concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to southern district of Lee.
Blurs were observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but last week it was already relatively less places.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations were observed, the lowest to high concentrations in Manatee County, the lowest to high concentrations in the coast or in the high seas near Sarasota County, the lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, the lowest to high concentrations in the coast or in the high seas near Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County were observed.
Respiratory irritations continue to occur in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
