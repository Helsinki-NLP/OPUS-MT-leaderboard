The great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel French was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel French, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
A thirty-one-year-old Pilsner native will be on the bench and could soon get into the wicket.
Former goalkeeper Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas he rotated and has not yet introduced himself at the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to another.
"Pavel French will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury in the lower body," he announced the whole of Denver in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning of American time he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he credited 94.5% of the procedures.
The Pilsner Hockey Breeder finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and did not catch a single match in his shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, “France” caught 36 matches, his success rate is 93.3%.
Charles puts a mask on his Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also published his wish, who used a photograph in which his wife Camille helped put on a mask at the races.
On its website, the BBC's British news station reported this.
They send wishes to friends, coworkers, and foundations that they work with.
The photograph was created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just like Princes George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate did not mention, is not even clear when it was created.
Last year, the royal family for a photo intended as a Christmas wish posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their rural mansion in Norfolk County.
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla also published a photo that serves as a Christmas card.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, who has a top hat on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask in colour matching her with a light dress.
Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title according to efotbal.cz.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the accused former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was to have a million crowns promised by Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the efotbal.cz server about this, saying that he had reached part of the police files.
The chairman of the Board of Directors of Vršovice club Jaroslav Třítík said that they did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police interceptions, in which Slavia mainly features its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who finished last summer in the championship club.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also in the case among the accused.
CSIs reportedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berbro a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from the official SK Slavia Prague should have a promised million-dollar bribe for winning the league, quoting the server from the file.
A day later, according to CSIs, Berbr met not only Nezmar, but also Chairman of the Board of Directors of Slavia Třitík.
According to the server, the file no longer indicates whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The claim rejected any corruption act.
From 2015 to 2017 we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees contrary to fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," said Mr.
In the comments, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former players of Slavia's dark skin and also slanders his former boss, Třitík.
The cauza of alleged influence of matches through referees triggered police intervention in several locations last mid-October, including the Prague seat of the FAČR.
The highest-ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, as well as former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoznica was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but basically worse type (the cannons must come from the armored cabin and carry the cartridges manually without covering).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armoured vehicles - on a decent level, we managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the lease, traffic - too small with short range but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a chase right next to town.
There were nutrias coming from the river, and they were doing crop damage, so I sat there.
When I came in, I saw there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly, and I guess the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something came out, but of course, the fox went in for a while.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his forehead all over the place, so I called on him to say it was a fox.
By the time I got off the set, he was gone.
Even a meadow can be a dick.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive things you take to your feet in a spacecak and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Inner got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in one day the amounts for the respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
What were the authorities doing economically?
And why did others buy trudgingly?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate soldiers and armies (I am probably not affected by the memories of ČSLA, which have been experienced by older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory military.
We don't even have large storerooms of techniques that could take on, we don't even have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is still more complicated, so the ability of the loaners will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition to modern conventional conflicts, where they can be deployed, they will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where they can lead a mass guerrillas and it is also a stated necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where gerila will already be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography.
We don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is half of them play as if they had it.
Then there's this situation where you watch like a dude who didn't hit an empty gate for two minutes, runs into an attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you're like, "What do you think's gonna happen now?".
Well, of course they're gonna rip him off like an average taxpayer.
The "finding a defender" situation is so terrible that I find myself quite frankly surprised to see our striker play one player.
First Swallows
Covid's pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major twist for the next few weeks.
The strain in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as it is known: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-stinfect immunity acquired from previous illness is helping against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, an antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, reducing the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented with paxlovid from Pfizer, which has reported a success rate of 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients is molnupiravir by Merck.
The company ended up on tape first and because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease in the South American continent.
With these researches, it is often neglected that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking 'as our beak has grown'.
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will tell you no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and they vote sides like AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying that in public means losing his job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they're really gonna find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmour, they both have over 20%, according to the poll.
We even know that the objects are three by Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the spinning of the units so the soldiers don't have to relearn where everything is, so all objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, sssr didn't want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory, whether for reasons of safety or speed of deployment of warheads due to a wester location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were retained, not the entire rockets as they are said.
If this weapon was needed, a special unit arrived to pick up the warhead and install it on some kind of carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolation state.
We had a classmate at the second grade of primary school, Cigan, and we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, often went out and wanted to explain something, missed little, went out on a regular basis, engaged in sports with us, did not steal snacks, or telephones, walked cleanly dressed.
He used to go to schools in nature, do a lot of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings, cigarettes joined the same class, other classes.
Shortly after, the teacher was beaten up, the police were often there, threatening and threatening other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an ad (old things, something I don't need etc) and I've sold a lot of money to the Cigans, they always had money, they didn't try to draw me to price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, and a guy called in a month and said he'd already signed it over.
I say myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if anyone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave like they belong in decent society (works, works, doesn't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, he lays out his hand, houses and houses, he's just a mess, he makes trouble... no matter what color he is, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start doing business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatick
"The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot despite the resuscitational care," she told the Right Speaker of South Bohemian medical paramedics Zuzana Fajtlová.
The crash was probably caused by the driver driving the girl.
An 18-year-old Peugeot vehicle driver probably drove in the direction of Žíchovec to the municipality of Bavarov and from undetected causes he drove in the turn into the opposite direction.
After the collision with Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle on the roof ended off the road, describing the accident by South Bohemian police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová.
A young Peugot driver suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
There were multiple injuries, and he remained incarcerated in the wagon.
After exoneration, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to a České Budějovice hospital, said the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not provide data about them
Luke Neuheisl also orders from abroad several times a month.
He's a collector's card guy.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars above, where it still pays to be imported, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector says.
Since October, ordering small shipments has been slightly expensive to him, newly they must add VAT and post office data to the customs proceeding.
He will receive an e-mail with a message that customs officials expect the package to arrive.
Then it is sufficient to fill in the consignment details, and if the trader has not already included VAT at the time of sale, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide himself with the customs procedure, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luke Neuheisl, however, the process is not complicated.
I'm going to click one or two keypads, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments, however, manage to deliver smoothly.
Due to new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad decreased from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the requests for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
At the moment, there are 30,000 shipments to be processed at the international post office.
If people were to fill out all the data that is needed and fill them in on time, we would be here about half way, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation Solutions
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation, and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down this growth or compensate?
In Poland, for example, do we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable about where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you need to add (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I operate while working.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for just six months?
This just doesn't take my mind off how a court can only put an animal like that behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
And not to mention the fact that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape reports?
The Man of the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The Grave Man accidentally helped the officers secure his nationwide wanted friend from Kostomlat, to whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He himself called them to her.
He went around the corner.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he was robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after calling 911 and were not surprised when the alleged "stealed" told them that he had invented everything to get the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers on how to make an announcement on the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then found out that the woman was on the wanted persons list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant for arrest is issued on her.
The case is therefore addressed by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally believe that we are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with mem, of course, that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :)
Of course, I don't deny that we have Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually trust something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world if I'm right, about 10,000 different religions.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that there's at least one god in some of those thousands of religions that will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
But even in the Tenth, there is no god but Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the thousands of gods wrong, and the one true god I just missed will send me to hell or to some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is, I suspect, similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months of one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files could use something like that.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can speak like this: the cooperation between the educational sector and industry is constantly regressing, the companies are hunting in schools and there is some kind of blending, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see this as a way to build a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, an institution that guarantees that Russia, a German or a Mongolian raider will never come here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved in stone, we have allies, and they'll defend us if there's trouble.
Oh, my God.
All it takes is one U.S. election to twist their budget and all of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown themselves once enough to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is an armed army and a population that can control the military technique of its time.
And today, any teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so what's not possible?
We don't need border fortifications, that's fucked up today, but a playful teenager behind a remote controlled device can handle it.
How to Not Drown in a Boxed Tsunami
You open presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home covered in boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is being reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And it's not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring a cardboard box, plastic or paper filling, to the connected store (map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging, which is currently scarce on the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of eco-minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filler material are carried to Popůvek near Brno by individuals to whom they pile up at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular shipments of cartons.
We will use everything to package shipments from our e-shop.
Together, individuals and companies make us a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to future generations, says Petra Lopušníková of Tierra.
The application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand in expired medicines, tires, retired electro, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All rubbish can thus end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such locations.
"The collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are gradually growing in it to help find use for things that would otherwise become waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Učliďme Česko.
Rather, I find it wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and stupidly resistant that children who use computers or phones play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
A problem has recently emerged (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but just let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron introduced the priorities of the French EU Presidency before the weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he revealed the Presidency's logo, calling for protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioning so many actions that they cannot be made in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and voters like it that way.
Macron's supporters of the gap between the right and the left agree on little, but Europe does.
And there will be a new head of state election in France in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is prepared to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise that Macron was interested in pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it's what they're trying to do to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French president Éric Zemmour is now circling France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for one history book seriously, and let's not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are learning history as a story we versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mouses" did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he kept to the top of the audience rankings.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the movie Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like, "Having the flu/get sick" I had diarrhea for a few days, and I didn't feel much like smoking...
It was worse than a common flu.
I don't have diarrhea in flu.
(Only a personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it that way)

Trains begin to run according to new timetable, somewhere will change carriers
As of Sunday, trains start to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where instead of České dráhy RegioJet begins to run.
For most lines, only the departure time or their route is adjusted slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets during the fall.
ČD plans to announce on average 6783 passenger services in the new timetable daily, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to national connections within the new timetable, the routes will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main innovation will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
As of next year, the carrier will traditionally increase fare prices by 3.2 percent on average.
The runways take into account inflation in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entrance to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Cologne.
The carrier will replace České dráhy after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Each day RegioJet on the line will convey a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Cologne stations as of Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlařík, despite planned exclusion work, the carrier tried to maintain as similar driving times as possible for its long-distance trains.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also be exchanged in some regional lines.
Passengers are waiting for changes, for example, in České Lípa, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav via České Lípa to Rumburk there will be trilex trains from the German company Die Länderbahn instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use uniform rail fares for the second year.
As with ČD, their price will increase by 3.2 percent inflation.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the view of the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were, and they had to work, they died.
I've never heard teaching from the slave side or from that time, nobody defends this, just condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one at school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they'll just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the U.S., right in schools, both in northern schools and in Southern schools.
I didn't see anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I've heard it happen before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example in Japan the atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it's just who they are, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from back then.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never do this again.
By the way, while we're at the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they too had some good achievements and I found it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North has not been much better, as a lot of people idealise it these days.
And a lot of people forget, too, that not everyone in the South was slavers, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, deliberately leaving out some facts, lying, and manipulating, even if our view doesn't exist with them (the YT also had a video from television, where they turned out someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I felt that at some universities it was appalling, those students were pretty radicalized, and those schools supported them many times.
And if I imagine that these people are going to be much older one day, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because among the young, and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feministism has long since achieved what he had, and it's not about the same thing anymore, has radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT themselves, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even in quite sensible matters.
Besides, the more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
Anyway, in conclusion, I didn't see anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery either.
More like I met with bad geography, but it was both-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely meaningless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality in general to be unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If I'm connected to people, interests, worldviews, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than about politics, but then he always fucks up some bullshit about the coronavirus that everyone's ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Church of Czechoslovakian Hussite.
Officially, they're Protestants, but they're actually born from Catholic modernity, and they're actually Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to Hussite worship because it's theologically very similar, but members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs under Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, Scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – Flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Scouts did not go to Vienna this morning, they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
He was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem's light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in each year, and I look forward to it very much.
It's an honor for me to be chosen, told the present journalists Scout Amalia the alarm clock.
While last year the handover took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, right on the border bridge, now at the crossing of Reintal – Břeclav in the parking lot.
Usually, though, scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes about the distribution of flame around the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the Diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18, the Scout Couriers will take care of the subsequent light delivery, who will travel by selected speeders and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take the light at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of coronavirus.
It's just like last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to keep distances, it was as few as possible, not singing colleagues, simply acting as safe as possible, describing the speaker of the action of the Bethlehem light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace simultaneously with the flame.
Bethlehem’s light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes darkness.
Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread in the Czech Republic for over 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including the list of places people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirms that subsidies are economic cancer, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make proper use of the money, but I do not understand why the money is spent in agriculture, industry and overall companies.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it crashes the free market and "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where there are a million "xy-funded/co-financed project xy" linings in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the braking of development where this company is holding up and taking down orders/employees to companies that could grow after its demise and become more productive
It's absolutely consent, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet is also caught in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think online ads are moving with me, but then I get caught up in the same way that they've influenced me - it's just so elaborate that one can't always resist it.
For this reason, too, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to put a complete ban on programmable (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all crap, in the words of classics - I'd ban the Internet.
I have a feeling from this vira ma roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion of which I'm going to claim to be a covert thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV has fallen through the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinemas, television stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen through the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will present a record of more than two hundred to their viewers in the premiere.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
In recent years, a genre of Christmas family and romantic films has scored and greatly increased ratings, which is why these films are becoming more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their name, so there will be more holiday films in reality.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are mostly fairy tales associated with this period, worldwide there are also popular pictures of Sam at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
However, the real boom of Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the special film series came with the American cable television station Hallmark, reminded the BBC server.
Her Advent Project called Countdown to Christmas then included four films and was very successful.
This year this station began to tune its viewers for Christmas on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime has 35 new Christmas films on the agenda this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book on Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies) described with exaggeration.
"For viewers it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the past few years," Gray added.
For example, according to him, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there's about half an hour before some misunderstanding ends, which, of course, will be solved successfully and those two will kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, they complement Gray.
Mazepin had positive text on covid-19, does not hit the final race F1.
Only nineteen riders will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Award in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
The Haas stable will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was to attack a better position from the 20th rung, which he took in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not eventually intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prize.
He was positively tested for covid-19.
Only 19 cars will appear on the starting grid, from the last rung to the line Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively well, according to Haas stables, and shows no symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, with safety being a final priority for all stakeholders," its representatives for formula1.com said.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, nor can he.
A substitute would have to be qualified or driven in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first racer.
At the start of the just ending season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were tested positively by Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton.
You could get arrested for this, too.
And no one cares that the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
In the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put six months of work into it and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in my home sweaters never wore much," Liban admits, who spent 3,000 hours over his work.
Silk was purchased in Italy, 24 carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars then adorned 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but silk gives sweater softness," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend to wash.
And there's one more problem.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as quickly as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "just" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the posting of up to 150 troops to assist Poland.
Women, explorers, and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build a planned fence.
Poland officially asked NATO states for assistance, in connection with the several months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of the Middle East countries on its territory with a false promise of an easy crossing of the Union border.
British and Estonian soldiers already operate on Polish territory.
Omicron mutation spreads in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene's running another case on a child from Adamov.
“We currently have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School is not demonstrated," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county in a week.
"We continue to wait for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – performed by the National Reference Laboratory for Flu and Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that they were two nurses from one department of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, two 11-year-old students of Adamov school.
There is no connection between cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four of which have no symptoms.
No one has traveled abroad with suspicion of Omicron
None of the above traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, have any contact with anyone residing abroad.
Link with the water polo championship is none of these, Ciupek said.
The main hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that the international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was being tested.
It also included South African players, and one Belgian player got sick on his return.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial anti-abortion law following embryo heart rate detection.
People would then be entitled to compensation in suing anyone who produces or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which kept the Texas abortion ban in effect, though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the US within about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court now did not decide on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was passed on to the public in this case, thereby preventing the Texas Republicans from attacking him by the usual judicial procedure.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (fifth) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the Texas maneuver in order to protect its law," said the Governor of California.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
It is said that he commissioned his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would warrant public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons are referred to, which do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and court expenses from anyone in California to produce, distribute or sell assault rifles, components into "the weapon of ghosts" or sets for their production.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets, to create a threat to private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the governor of California.
The AP agency notes that California has for decades banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June the federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the State would now actually renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of the Liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed, who, in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, warned of the extension of the legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas abortion ban full immunity to judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected officials of the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where it is gradually discovered what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccine itself is improved, based on results.
For example, Israel already has a major study of the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to five times the increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect mentioned by you.
Just like any other inoculation will have its vaccination schedule over time, but it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should soon come on the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times more efficiency.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the Union budget
According to Zibra, the European Commission would act in contravention of the law if it exercised new powers and, due to the dispute over the rule of law, stopped paying money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw EUR 36 billion from the Union Fund to restore economies affected by covid-19 pandemics.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail by veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a tight majority in Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in Union energy and climate policy, which lead to drastic increases in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish Minister has provided.
His party takes more radical positions in EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice Party.
According to the European Commission, the changes undergone by the Polish judiciary for Ziobr's work threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Zibra, Brussels builds “impossible conditions because its aim is not the rule of law, but the change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw faces a "political dictatorship conducted by blackmail and efforts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles", Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels as would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland's colony status," he said.
But to know about it... in our country, Lidlo, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I haven't looked at other things, I've met one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk racks I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector, all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If it's avoided, I don't want to go to any market anymore, no action, no gold store in the square, but they usually have everything I need, and it's got some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidlo to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data like manure being handled here, most of the vaccinate opponents are just a little bit more off the plate than most of the vaccinate advocates.

Binary reasoning: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.

Ugh, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outburst, and have a nice day, all of you.
I was punished with a cook when I was a kid.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I refused to listen and I was angry repeatedly (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, Mom always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "knapping" of the cooker only brought and laid down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few butt punches (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical penalties (in reasonable execution and extent) are beneficial because the child responds much more to them than to words.
What I think is important is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice in a way of whether or not he will listen and get, or he will improve, and the punishment will not be.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether the sacred charter, which she swears on and about which she has been taught at school, or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary, was definitely inclined to the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and better spare them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, he glossed on the question Vojtěch Cepl.
More and more recently, however, the opinion among lawyers appears that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years it has been tested by situations that its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought out.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a sort of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that define the politicians of the game's mandate.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are binding bans on policies.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a few months old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder with children, there are also difficult cases that hospitals have been dealing with most recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said the New Chief of the Department of Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children in need of mild supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on the ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were continuously in the ward, according to the doctor throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease interferes next to adults both adolescents and several months old babies.
Children in severe condition are also found in hospitals due to coronavirus.
"We currently have a child of several months and adolescence," said the chief.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have yet been recorded on the coronavirus in the FN Brno Children's Hospital.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in a children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus ward – it is an integral part of the collaboration of a psychologist.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination reduces the course of the disease in children and also reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"This is why we recommend the injection of the vaccine in children," the doctor said.
In the peace zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
You can see them on the tourist map on map.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the resting zone you can go anywhere (but don't cross the fence into the field).
Skiing/skiing in the forest outside marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but, of course, it is not so much guarded outside national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music runs in my head, laughing Josef Kurfiřt.
He is breast-fed by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing virtually all repertoire and as a conductor he acts not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Šalda, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Wall Philharmonic, with the Film Philharmonic or with the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of a controlled disease and that the authoritarian regime faces a crisis better
Sinologist Jirous: China is building the impression of a managed disease and that the authoritarian regime faces a crisis better.
China has gone on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop the contagion that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in the infected.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids, and Chinese doctors are often helping to fight the coronavirus, for example, even in Italy’s worst affected.
How to perceive Beijing’s willingness?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend of a friend meets him and says, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?
I got him, and he's awesome.
My wife likes it because she saves the grass, she washes the car with her trunk, the kids play with it.
Just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: All right, high five, that's gonna be great...
After a while, they meet and the guy who bought it complains, "Dude, what did you sell for an elephant?"??
The grass is melted, the giant shit everywhere, the car is cut apart, the kids fight him, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The guy who sold says you're talking about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by powers.
Although sovereign state equality applies, it is the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
It is currently operating at the level of economic and political (in selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different, and it will succeed.
It occurred to me, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a word person.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse mostly includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish orange and tangerine", when it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas it is no longer clear from Mandarin that they are from Spain for "Spanish fruit and tangerines."
Moreover, I base it on the phrase being "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and there is no further need to specify it for the US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying :D
Either way, it's a ridiculous request.

Vicki Holland of Britain tortured the monkey cosman Milly
Scary footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her and laughed at her.
Holland's monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutritional needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwent has now for life banned her from breeding animals, informing the daily The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of the apes who care about Milly after her abuse have stated that they have never seen such a frightened cosman before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she is once again happy playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
Four times a mother confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrate Court, she was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life-long ban on breeding animals, and has to pay CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue even further."
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the view of new people can still create panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adding Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after the Gwent police discovered scary footage in the wife's phone after a raid in her apartment over drug charges.
On the shots you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
The next video shows Holland offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, “Do you want cocaine? ”
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) confessed to possession of cocaine with intent to sell it.
In her house, £1,000 of cocaine was found (in excess of £50,000) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from this prehistoric three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
You mean you're gonna take the same things out of your freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And it's all killing the idea of bifling, where no one, honor exceptions, doesn't care if you can or understand.
Just take a test on 1, and then nobody cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even scratch it, and they'll tell you they're totally fucked.
Then what the fuck is he learning for?
I'm a big fan of general review, and the fact is, people don't want to, and they don't need to.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly learning for the many people who will need the thing.
But, like, the remark that you really don't need all this to stand by the machine, I meant it completely because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(What our communist past is probably involved in with us and being hunted against the educated and elites) However, the price of the barbarians standing by these machines is simply high.
I mean, if journalists could count, what do you think was never going to reach this size?

Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave right away," Andrea answered at the Instagram in Stories about the curious questions of the curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to shut down all contact and even block it on social media.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it was gnawing from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
She resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was upset by the turn of Kadri in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity now didn't even like his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stand up for her brother publicly.
Normally, I don't talk about things like that at all, and even in my family, we've never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, they just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do this this way, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri publicly for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed him the most, despite how young he was.
I'm even more sorry to have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I wish I could have known Kadri as much as I, our loved ones and our family, stood in the creed in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know what it really was, have added indefinitely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's about.
Cao started his robbery expedition in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually alienated less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he thought of nothing better than climbing to the 5th floor and climbing through an open window into the apartment.
That's where he stole two bananas.
The footage from one of the security cameras then captures him walking down the street from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner woke up this morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
A man confessed to drinking alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.

More than 60 percent of voters came to vote for the councils of four municipalities on Saturdays
The new councils were elected by people on Saturday in the municipalities Komňa na Uherskohradiště, Lužice na Mostecku, Nová Ves na Liberecku and in Rovná na Pelhřimovku.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the legally determined number or the elected council has disbanded.
There were 99 candidates for the total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of Saturday's election results symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were quite four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very monitored election to the Chamber of Deputies, said Vice-President Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that the Covid-19 epidemic made the election more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
In Komni na Uherskohradiště, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's election, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two mandates.
Two seats in the council were won by Citizens for Komňa, with 18,52 percent of the electorate voting.
The mayor of the municipality Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privacy Policy, has also re-entered the council.
The Komňans – independent candidates – reached one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
The Pro Rovna Association won in the municipality of Rovná in Pelhřimov.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, meaning four mandates out of seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2 joined the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated election in Lužice on the Mosteck was won again by the Association of Lužice and Svinčice led by Mayor Henry John.

The second ended with a candidate for the municipality for the people, who voted 43.27 percent of the electorate, with three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
The election in Nová Ves on Liberec was won by independent candidates of Hope for the New Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, earning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
YES received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the proper elections in 2018, gaining more mandate and having three.
Election turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had raised, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, such as the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from 12 meters.
He survived the crash on concrete.
An incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was interfered with by rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
Officials of the Regional Operations Center received an hour after Saturday midnight an emergency call with initial information about a man's fall from altitude.
Two crews of ZZS – medical and medical – immediately set off.
Upon arriving at the scene, paramedics found that a 27 - year - old man was to fall from a window about 12 metres [12 m] high and hit concrete with his head!
There was coal in Vítkovice.
But not the way it should, and the fire department went into action.
At the time of arrival of the rescue service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The interventional physician intubated his airway, secured artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures in pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance vehicle transported him to further care of the Ostrava Traumatic Center, informed ZZS spokesman of the MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I'm more concerned than I am about coronavirus because of inadequate responses from the public and the authorities.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of combating the disease is primarily faced by doctors and medical personnel.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military physician David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
The MMA experienced a great gala full of interesting results.
Things were happening at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňa managed to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hadn't found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in lightweight, showed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept away Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This brought a women's bout of bantam weight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered into battle with each other as an imaginary "dwarf", for Nunes did not lose for seven years and sharpened her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively and even gave her a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peña did not allow herself to make another mistake and unsuccessfully tried to attack herself using a lever on her arm.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals took on a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Peneña put Nunes on the ground where she started strangling her.
She had to give up and knock it off.
The American woman thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was better off, but the card gradually began to reverse.
In the latter, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to hit the opponent with a lever on his arm.
Although this did not work out well, he then created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back and sprinkled him with a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock the strangulation off.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, on the contrary Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He subsequently beat him with a series of precision strikes and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now losing after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most of the principal names in the Czech language express only one grammatical genus, and therefore there is no problem in them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle genus.
But then there is also a fairly large group of essential names in which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
They then gain double endings when bowing down, and in some cases they remain in an incoherent form.
For example, the words "quick" or "whistle" are both male and female, in the first, they bow down according to the pattern of "machine", in the second, according to the pattern of "song".
In the case of another group of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the uniform heading, such as: ‘row/row’, ‘keptub/kedubna’ or ‘potato/potato’ (in terms of food).
Both shapes are in writing, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may vary regionally, such as "curcuma" in Bohemia and "curcuma" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly other Czech-Moravian pairs of words are on it: "dift" and "dift", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that penetrated Czech from other languages were originally inflexible, but gradually the Czech endings take over.
A typical example is the term "image", which is a genus of both male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained incoherent in the middle genus, but has ends according to the pattern of "garden".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants attempting to move on to Europe.
Thousands of people began to embark on the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise to support Greece, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
What really motivates refugees to a uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen blue skies in three months, and we choked, describing a journalist from Sydney.
The devastating fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to a journalist from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they're trying to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who's been framed.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how these people are often treated by their surroundings or by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up to their traumas.
Too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there will be those who falsely accuse someone.
It's gross and spit in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is fictional" and that it's "trend" you're only helping sex offenders.
Czech Republic floods built houses, families have no money to finish
Construction material prices have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have been put in a difficult position.
Because it does not have the means to complete built-up family houses, and banks refuse to raise mortgage loans to it.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already built family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise mortgage loans to them, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move into undeveloped and unconstructed homes.
In the worse case, built houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and pay rents," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of it happened to us.
As a construction company, it is difficult for us to keep some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivon.
A lot of people are gonna be in financial trouble.
If they're counting on building a house for five million, now it's gonna cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivón added.
Copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment were the most important of the material.
However, construction companies also struggle with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction fields are missing, and the influx of foreign workers is hampering the pandemic.
Only the situation with regard to the issue of a building permit is more favourable at the moment.
"Construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček specified.
We're fine, and we're gonna be even better.
Real visions are missing, says Czech Republic commentator – myRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entry to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, apart from the Prime Minister and President ANO Andrei Babiš, they spoke to the nation and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman as well as the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What did we learn?
As in that, I find my thesis super, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on my bachelor thesis, I always work on it all year, and then in a week or two I'll write up the written part.
The statesmen are at peace with us, unless you're a total goblin and there's something left in your head, the committee won't smother him with a theory.
For example, I was studying for a week at state school, and when I was at the end of my life, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation that came right to me, and I had it right.
Otherwise, with the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we've done it a lot, really beneficial, a lot to learn) and then they just learn the project and they've done it.
I think it's great when there's a test at the end of the course to project the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't overwhelm e-mails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be a dick like them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you can easily build a statue of Putin next to the statue of Pooh Bear.
Maybe you put it on Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks at artists.
As soon as you don't give a new picture every day and at least every other day, your ranges will go down to the minimum.
Plus, it keeps changing what function is more important, like, comment or saving.
It's been pissing me off lately, so I might have to go down to the tick, where a lot of artists in my business are successful and barely able to do it.
In the end, I might even like something user-friendly to come that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration by the Workers' Party on Donbase
The union – yes, breaking – no, the opponents express their opinion in the picture of the USSR breaking.
Thirty years since the illegal collapse of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster occurred in the history of mankind.
In the Belarusian Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open clemency of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of the SSR as an international law entity and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one cut of the pen, they “resigned” a huge country with nearly 300 million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia’s population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years in one sitting in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately did deindustrialization, braked agriculture, tore away from the world's largest power fourteen republics, which had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poorness of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all resulting from geopolitical surrender, the surrender of first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "vacuum force".
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste quickly filled and conquered NATO countries that have adopted our geopolitical surrender.
And to this day, the whole world is shaken mainly because of events from the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'm gonna buy it, and I'm gonna put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday, the chain will be left to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to CZK 69 / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by CZK 120 and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer it myself - nothing.
This bullshit about when something is cheap, it has to be guaranteed to be bad, bad or bad quality are so retarded, to tell you the truth;-)
Now I went to Hlavs in Brno and they gave out a brochure in the underpass, I always take things like that to help the temps, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of the functioning of the world, but nowhere was anything about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be some sort of agitation.
After I finished reading, I found out who was publishing it, and then Scientology came out.
Well, like good stuff, full of completely useless instruction, like getting washed up and not being a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail force you to accommodate that person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself several times because of the fact that I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and begged me not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
For a year, it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by, and she started going nuts.
Then I ended the relationship with the one that I told her that I was breaking up, and he lied to her, but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch an amok again.
Such a person will suck your feelings, emotions, and joy in general.
You'd better keep your distance.
When the insurance companies here are furiously robbing by buying a cloud of tests and fast for positives who wouldn't even know about this horrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we achieve is a complication for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been grounded for five days.
In the west, they've already stopped the clowning and acknowledged that it's not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new and has to steal something else and fuel your ego by fabricating faggots.
I see we've got a good old bastard coming back.
After a few years of attenuation and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting again returns to the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at the university), initial promises to train products and business skills quickly shifted to "you don't care, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products that I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and talk people.
When the first money was made, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make a living, he had to tap several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so it made a person feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
What I can say, though, was that experience was valuable, one learned not to jump on every fat and information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in the same bag.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen many of these things in the corporation where I work.
HR is cool, managers are looking at their management, and they're not really sticking their noses in anything.
So the regular evaluation is going on somehow, in the form in which it happens in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, we will see what came out and what did not) - it is more self-evaluation than someone would evaluate you by some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we're also a little bit unique within our company - there's a department that's more corporate.
Sometimes one feels like we're kind of a almost-startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works that way, they don't bother us much as long as the results are.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Foreign Affairs Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that they found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we won't be sharing more information on the case.
My condolences, he posted on Twitter Kulhánek.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on the bus on her way home from work, she was to collect money from the ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues from work five days later.
Subsequently, London police began searching for her, Interpol ranked her as missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police detained a man in this context a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case, and what he suspected, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, new councils were assigned in four municipalities
On Saturday, December 11, a new council was elected in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskohradišť, Lužice na Mosteck, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rovná na Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the legally determined number or the elected council has disbanded.
There were 99 valid candidates for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Election turnout reached 62.41%.

The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of Saturday's election results symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very monitored election to the Chamber of Deputies.
Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed most of the work in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which imposed greater demands on equipment and personnel security.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to cope with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major setbacks.
Coping with how idiotic a lot of the population on all its layers is about it, I have a problem with that so far.
I'm looking forward to getting a vaccination tomorrow because it's gonna make me finally less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his office as president and be able to regain it.
The chances of it actually happening are, as others say, very small.
Besides, I'm not sure a shredded file could be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: There are growing numbers of people under 35 who are without sex all year long
More and more young adults in the U.S. live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounced sexual life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported that they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed a survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks, or video games that make sex less and less a priority for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 has been growing rapidly, stating that they have not had sex in the previous year," said researcher IFS Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of them saying that they have been without sex in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although the spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 still declines.
Young people are divided into premarital sex, about 30% thinks it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group there are minorities, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone talks about these 30%.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, there is a reason for religious establishment.
Since 2008, the ratio of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60% for single people under 35 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less believers", the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone stated.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social alcohol drinking during pandemic times, also contribute to the decline of sexual activities.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is smaller in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media that seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replaceing” this need.
This trend was mainly followed by a lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole ordering of vaccination against covid is about whether society should force a portion of the population into behavior they don't want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question that I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
I.e., the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some disinformation, and as a result, he didn't give himself an inoculation, and he finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we're responsible for the death of an accursed anti-vaccination opponent who's here at the side of the SPD and the C.S.S.C. is screaming something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics that I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will really be responsible for this themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does mild winter sign up to fight drought?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic so far.
Operators of ski resorts can not manage without technical snow, weather complicates the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story to tell, but it's not about a churchboy.
One day in high school, the teacher led us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there we walked down one quite wide street and who we do not see in the middle - the followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but I had a conversation with a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
There's not much going on, but the system's already crashing, says Orozovich.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, is, according to the chancellor, worth addressing with the use of diplomatic negotiations, even within the “Normand Group”, bringing France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine together.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we were determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but another nun was driving the car, trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving priority in driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, said TVN24.
She admitted another nun crashed into the vehicle asking her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestine.
She was given a breathing test, and immediately after they found out that she had more than two per mille in her blood, a driver's license was taken.
At the same time, she was informed that she would confess her actions in court.
Dog Hugo is doing his best.
But Juraj Shaymovich did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedy have seen in American stories about dog pets.
In doing so, however, they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After a cheesy film by F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, the audience emotion in the cinemas is now receiving another film Here we watch.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovich Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film I watch here from 2012.
Talking dachshund Hugo and some famous characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is dying, and so they begin to invite a dogger, Julie's father with a partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Shajmovicová (who is also a film producer) had been dealing with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog picture, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's review.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in the longing for a child and when the proper "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined – on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired Colonel Mojmir, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia), who falls into a coma, then is taken by the family to take the hospital in the heart of Šumava's solitude, so that a miraculous process of dog healing can take place.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pet animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the spectator wonders what content pelmel full of incredible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of shoplifters from the staff, dog contests, a Šumava charlatan, cops coming to report looking for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilized power of bone meal – and which a baked family in the guest house will of course get drunk.
When a heroine wakes up after a difficult coma and then sits in a tuxedo and makeup with a cigarette at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and slacks as a cured vegetarian, you can't laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain that “this happens sometimes after a coma.”
Šajmovich's team lacks basic dramaturgic knowledge of work with text, ability to build load-bearing situations, feeling for character and point and overhead.
The acting performances are unbalanced, the cut is clueless and the overall impression is wronged.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their party, they have little to play.
The film's only location remains poetic footage of the Šumava nature of cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch several characters, a flimsy plot and dog lines, let alone more popular vulgar expressions by which the characters commit themselves.
The argument is not even an old membership of the Badger Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer's wife.
The good intentions of promoting the nature and friendship of a man with a dog must include knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
There's a little too much erotic and minimal feeling for the genre for a good family picture.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapia, this amateur-like stunt wouldn't go through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how you understand shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to kids like that all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case, it's a part-time job.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time in a year when it rains.
"Such a complete absence of rainfall during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Weather Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas set, enjoying the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasím Ashkar.
The rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are impactive and irregular.
Winter rains depend on the forests.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was filled to the edge this spring due to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the levels have been dropping.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be less rainfall here," the spokesman for the Uri Schor Water Management Authority predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or sewage recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of Jordan, Amman, the cistern chariots are increasing.
Water ducts and private wells are drying out.
"My orders rose 70 to 80 percent this year compared to two previous years," said Imad Sulejman, a tanker driver in September.
There were clashes between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The trough of the local river found itself completely waterless.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister stated that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and that he informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz stated on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, informing Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., tries to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but also informs Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida Gantz, he said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them".
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I was prying the lady a little bit and grilling in an interview to find out what she wanted me to do.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
'Cause I really don't like these scams, so I kept asking the lady questions and questions for a while and finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I'm a punk, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers set out to the mountains this weekend, expecting plenty of snow and nice weather
The mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major ski rush this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week there is no need for snow and some ski areas have started operation.
She did not discourage the skier or the obligation to prove herself in the lifts by covid certificate.
While the ski lifters do not complain about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region set out on the cross-country trails and on the slopes during the weekend.
The skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sport complex Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people set out for the first weekend skiing in the new season also to Jeseníky.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or a resort in Branná na Šumpersku had opened.
Weekend attendance was very decent, an estimated 400 people arrived on Saturday and today.
Conditions are great.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare praise by the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Skiareal operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after losing covid-19 disease.
Except for the exceptions, people are prepared for this and prove the necessary documents, told ČTK René Hroneš from the ski center Špindlerův Mlýn.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in ski rental.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová of the Opava Skiopava store.
More strain is expected during the ski course period.
Also, Snowbear's manager David Shinták feels that the covid is not as interested in lending ski equipment as he used to.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowing.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, said CTK Šinták.
According to him, people got lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by a rental in Novako on Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and interested parties must order them in advance.
"We start lending this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a great deal of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the Pavlína Nováková complex.
According to her, interest comparable to the pre-eminence period is also a ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist's doctor.
Smart and skilled people who have no property are going abroad.
The owner of the company doesn't just go abroad.
But he's totally in agreement with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a sensible future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one beautiful day, ruling the year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election at all.
If it's hard to live here, some traditional V4 freak can win here too.
Young and educated leave, his supporters remain, and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic was in full swing autumn, in Thailand the crew of the film Ostrov led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of the face on social media.
Is this a real injury, or is this a filming trial?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are beginning to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor, of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, about 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her coworkers on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová served as an "assistant to nurses" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We have enormous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical establishments said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police," continued the message.
The public also calls for cooperation from Mrs Harriet Harman, who pointed out the Srnc case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are of course worried to death," said Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and worked here for our health care," said Harman.
Police have previously detained one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news site, however, police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
Even I don't underestimate Ukraine that way.
These are not "large quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the invasion and starting to get sick of our entry.
I quoted upstairs.
I don't know what made you think Russia wanted war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
Comparison with the situation in 38 is out of so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that to the first Punic war and the "anex" sicilie :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to keep the agreements from Minsk, Russia would elect those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would match.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague since Sunday, they will touch mainly suburban connections
Passengers in Prague integrated transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others were lost.
Mladoboleslav is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday stop express trains from České Budějovice in the Garden City station.
In suburban train transport, trains S7, which pass through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to České Brod.
In the recently opened station Prague-Garden City, the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will be stopping.
The PID will newly spread to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go all the way to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Old Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in Mladoboleslav will be incorporated, including lines with a crossover to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Region.
During integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 functioning operations will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will come out of Zličín in Prague, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be reinforced in the morning rush hour and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line number 404 will start.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 are included in the PID system driving to the Liberec Region.
They leave from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The return line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonný in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of Central Bohemia local lines, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rozžmitál pod Třemšín.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Praha – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
The changes await passengers at other locations as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on the 420 line from Dobříš with connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevska.
The route of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk was changed and the routes of some buses on the border of central Bohemia and Horovicka in the Pilsen Region are modified.
Healthy snack / lunch at the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only way to get food is to go next door to Billy or down the road to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to practice after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at a speed I will buy maximum pizza buns and yogurt and apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in a supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you, unfortunately it is.
And it's not the trees you need to see.
Only the top of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason why they forbid us to ride off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confession of Dara about the relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has lived nothing but a revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been hanging out since summer, the famous footballer even got a divorce for the singer.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she had been hiding her love from them for six months.
"I allow myself to argue that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěd," Dara Rolins jokes, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She said he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
Here we go.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen someday, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who don't care at all, and it's coming out of the can, or we, whose lives are being dissected in detail.
It's like one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough for each other, or you insisted that everyone really knows the list of your ex-partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want. That's what bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
The bear has long served as vice president of Juventus Football Club.
They didn't come out with the truth until now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to be completed.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are not married in paper form for only three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us luck.
We're just people too, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and like him, I stand by him. For better or worse, Rolins closed down.
Hello, the other commentators have probably said all the essentials, just confirming that the tracks are great until the beginning, my classmates have mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two, and then they found their rentals together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments aren't usually advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cejla, but also the surroundings (streets such as Vranovská, French etc., that is a very bad address), even some parts of the Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, the King's Field and that direction is fine, besides that it is close to most faculties of the BUT (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I mean, I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native of the Worm, so I can maybe consult Brno as such if you were missing any more information :)
That's an example of "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly all right that the state does not finance some schools enough.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it on their own, or they go by state and they pay for it.
We can't let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he raises a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and that will enable him to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, has expressed himself in this way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a voice against someone having an abortion is the same to you as a voice against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced in cataloguing/digitization that (even long-time professionals) it will either somehow throw it out of the eye, or write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and in the note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note based on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some sign databases and look for the nearest one.
But since you seem to be drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't that more of a Odry Empire than a OdryN?
PSS: Someone's already cracked it for you.
Check out that comment with
Politicians have no idea what will be the 'them' of our Presidency.
That's a hell of a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is funny.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, but some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for informal contacts, establishing superior relationships.
Moreover, with English, it is quite interesting, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't get that hat on Ceyl.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I come home from work at 10:00 and never have a problem?
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's never been there in his life.
Yeah, probably most of the Romani population of Brno live there, but all they do is get in the way on the sidewalk and parkja where they don't have :D is not that I'm afraid to climb the street there tonight.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap apartment with good access to the center, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovac (78) without Dada and mistress Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's he gonna spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the Advent Wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slovacek didn't.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw the dáda wreath, and I'm sure Lucie has some too, told the Lightning saxophonist who confirmed the words of Patras that he frequented it often.
She visits, but does not live in their home in Vinohrady, where Dada after his departure was left alone.
He still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We met recently with Annie, Felix, and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelem: Another team!
Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelem:
But we talked all the time, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I keep buying gifts, and I'm sure I'll buy something for Dáda and Lucia, probably perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the baptism of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to hang out with, says Slovak, who was happy to meet Ludek Saturday's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Novlta.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are short, and they can't afford it, so the firemen themselves, and anywhere else, there's not a high percentage of people with medical training at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend only Ostrava goes to the head of the previous governments, not the military, it's been begging for new toys for long enough.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic has been going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters have decreased in mountain and sub-mountain areas, with less precipitation recording even places where there has not been an emergency about moisture.
Climate change is the cause of drought in much of Central Europe.
But the effects are also enhanced by the way we manage the soil.
What is there to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I can barely keep skating on the ice, I don't know what playing hockey and the tactics (what I tried at Franchise Hockey Manager) are also a total mess.
And whether you're the "bear Russia" or "lama China" hockey team, losing by two goals even if you don't have to win at all costs is different than when it's leveled.
But anyway, what I listen to is Czech commentators who point out, what referees notice whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
There's controversy everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic has lost more often to Russia than it won, it would probably be a classic "we've won" vs. "We've won".
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 1967 for 100,000, 871 for 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily death rate since the end of October.
Britain faces an "inevitable" large wave of contagion, caused by Omicron, said on television on Sunday, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor for the British Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Persons infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
So far, no one has died of omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
UK Labour chief Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister advocated that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, they participated in it at Downing Street by a group of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is increasing to remove Johnson from prime ministership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
Both the British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial television editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won by overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from office as prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits elections in the spring that can end Viktor Orbán's 12-year reign.
It will be an election of European importance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz side controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesza to bind voters from determined districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about, not if Fidesz wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
That's a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they try to keep the power playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér leaked to independent media, where he tells secret service chiefs that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Is that the indication of the new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
Everything starts with the language.
I've been beaten quite often, the last time at 14, Mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, Dad has had it for a long time, but then it explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a little girl, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and was all blue, and they took me under the shower about two times to calm down.
Sometimes they gave me a slap, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I certainly have a tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a child, I've been fighting quite a bit, now I'm going to hit something for discharge, and as a younger parent, I've been slapping my hand like that (so I don't get too much out of my mouth), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to the extent that it's my explosive, but I'm sure the education has a part to it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids too and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting kids is just wrong, and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially at the time when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws things up, maybe it's not possible not to screw their kids up a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws are to be clear and unambiguous.
I'd call kundami the ones that make up the law in that quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're worried about a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on people wanting and buying the product, and you'll have something to pay the mortgage for?

Where will Slovakia move the trial with the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in a trial with four defendants for the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connection to top Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
It's all the press's fault.
How is it possible that this petition had a lot more media attention than the anti-petition of deans of all medical faculties that came out a day or two later?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
Minister Karl Havlíček's proposal needs to be substantially reworked
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is over, and there is still no law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of the deep-sea storage of high radioactive waste.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after years of transit.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the deep-sea repository, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-administration expects a more significant strengthening of its options in decision-making on the repository, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to redefine the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karl Havlíček, who has the Platform at his disposal, criticises the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the choice of the site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the start of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a substantive intent almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statists in authorisation procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the whole search and selection process of the repository site, its authorisation and operation.
According to today's legal standards, municipal officials do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a storage space.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the Office or the Minister, in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation, decides.
Any action shall not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of research or construction work.
Codecision of self-government, which the Platform asks for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorisation of storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by SÚRAO and following contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
According to the contract register, the total for these works is expected to amount to almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Vice Mayor of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against the Deep Sea Storage said: After the ministers of industry, who settled the position of self-government against the state authorities in search of the deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste just pushed away on their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The deep-sea storage platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep-sea storage.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of the site for possible storage should be conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced to weight loss fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything in his lifestyle for years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And that worked.
The Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the Roseanne sitcom is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body caused the crackling of furniture.
"I put everything in my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
I wanted to do it slow this time.
Move, practice.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, he said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that's expecting readers from the game environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and a college text, I'd probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more kinds of bosses for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, doesn't it, and so is "boss" something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, Hidden boss), who are not ever needed to beat the game or level has been completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need games like Half-Life, where bosses are, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and you can even call them that?
And then there's the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in a simple way, Czech and other languages do not solve it in any way (it is interesting only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game of general importance, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
Czech police also became involved.
The missing Petra Srnce has been wanted by the British police since December 3.
Czech police were involved in the search as well.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherland has been looking for her since December 7th.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"Czech police work closely with British police," said police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimetres tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, since such disappearance is very unusual for her.
Ms Harriet Harman was involved in the search for Petra.
She's involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police officers have already apprehended one suspect.
But it is unclear who he is and what he had to do with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October indicated a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month, with the approaching end of the year, the attacks intensified significantly.
We've seen a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is intended to attract attention in the user by a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name had the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the correction receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Esset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it subsequently sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and, with the impending holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
Spyware Formbook remained active in November as well.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically focus on the Czech Republic and security specialists captured more campaigns with global reach in November.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still stands behind almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contained most often an annex to the .exe extension, which bore the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt also appears.
The annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and downturn in activity are recorded by security analysts at the Fareit program, which was worth 1.6 percent of the attacks and has had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
Today's demo of smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinate morons.
The Prague parade was larger than the media reported.
Based on the footage of the waterfront parade and in my experience, I'm not afraid of an estimate of about 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and opposite waterfront communications.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by are spontaneously added to the parade of about 4,000 protesters.
I say something new is born here, writes Radek Wet.
That the continued dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to their finding a common language.
Only antivaxers themselves, anti-villains and associates could not fill or pay for a parade this big.
The actions of the Dip Dog Society have an upward popularity, reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I think they rent the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what kind of movement this dissatisfaction would be, depending not only on the supply of money, but also on whether a three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will become a square and more batch.
It certainly won't be the left-wing movement or the center, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become multi-dose because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The genius of scientists that humanity is rightly proud of.
The end of the heel, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned the formation of a new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue the change that won the November election.
This has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition that should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has lasted since April, when the past government lost the election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so there were two more early elections.
What do cats do when no one's watching?
The "secret" shot is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, there were growing concerns about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech Republic, after which London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to police, the current employer or MP representing the part of London where she resides calls for information about a child hospital worker.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are beginning to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor, of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, about 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her coworkers on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová served as an "assistant to nurses" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We have enormous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical establishments said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police," continued the message.

In Ústí nad Labem, a green moon hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was a death.
The Magistrate referred complaints about the HSD, which road belongs to, and because it allegedly did not respond, a hole of evil continued.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the HSD began to deal intensively with the situation.
