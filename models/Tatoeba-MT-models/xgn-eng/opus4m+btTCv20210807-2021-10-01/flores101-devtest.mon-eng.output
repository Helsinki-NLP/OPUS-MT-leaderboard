Traffic flow is the interlocking study of individual drivers and the movement between the two points of the caller station and the interaction between each other.
Unfortunately, exploring traffic streams is hard because it can't predict one hundred percent of drivers' behavior.
Fortunately, drivers behave in relatively consistent ways, so traffic flows tend to be relatively stable, and they can be expressed in mathematics.
In order to express better traffic flow, there are three main parameters created, including (1) flow, (2) compact and (3) frequency.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design, and operations of the roadfield.
