He has spoken like this in the case of health authorities who recommend that patients with dengue be given proper treatment instead of self - medication.

The former president of the Republic of North Carolina is going to confess his guilt for lying in a trial
Court documents that were attacked on Friday report that he had lied to the Federal Constitutional Court of the Republic of Carolina that he had been lied to by the Federal Constitutional Court.

Hayus is said to be known as a part of the criminal agreement, and in 2018, he was told that in a document signed by Hays, the lawyer signed by him, he was to be known by him as the very other person who questioned the FI agents of the FI.
The Convention has been sealed, and he does not really mention any charges he approves of.
At first, he was charged with scheming, bribery, and slander.
The chief insurance system of the state had charged the case with the case of Hayus, former member of the State’s company, with the policy of making a donation of public distribution and making a donation in response.
The official, Greg Lindberg and his associates, were charged with trying to bribe Mike Kaspi, state insurance director.

He also contributed to the democratic evangelizations and its politicians.
His lawyer did not respond to the message that was sent on Friday.
Karen Davis, a lawyer of Hays, did not answer further to the message sent to the discussion on Friday.
The court documents that were attacked on Friday report that he had lied to the FBI agents in August 2018 that he had never talked to Kashi about the worker in the state insurance department.
But Hays actually spoke to the insurance order about the request for the Lundberg to change workers in the face of the system’s system.
The prosecutors have said that Lindberg helped him when he asked for a meeting with the Cassander and that Huss directly recommended bribery to Reinstructure.
The charge issued in April charges that Lindberg wanted to make special contributions to his insurance business and that Kassa had placed up to $2 million for the campaign.
The charge also included the request to change the department officer, who was studying a company of the Lindbergs.
He told the officials of the Republic of Germany that he had tried to bribe them and helped them to defend their claim.
There is no charge against him.
During a conversation that took place in Lintberg and Kaspi, a friend of Lindberg asked Huys to send him $20,000 to the relic campaign.
The charge is also said that Hays, who first refused to say that it would be noticed by sending such large amounts of money, was also justified at the end of the conversation.
The charge says that he said he said he said that you all want to do what you want.
Well, I'm making him do this.
The authorities did not respond to information for the Federal Constitutional Court in order to give further information about the guilty agreement.

Leonard Kelley: I was told that I, with Klaaso accent, would never be able to enter the telescope
He revealed that television officials told him that he could never be a broadcaster because of his blaspheming to him.
Looking back over 35 years in the telescope, Kellie recalled that she felt like a movie before she first appeared on the screen.
He said that I had been in the full - time ministry when I was 25 years old.
I was working as a researcher in the Pacific Scotland, and my employer said that he could never enter the television because of the goose explosion.
Before I took charge of the Glass office, I went to London to see all the television crews and to see the show.
I will never forget that on that morning, Anne, and Mike were interviewed by the famous Patves.
I couldn’t believe that I was in the same room where a very prominent man was.
This was the place I wanted to be.
Kellie, who started his life as a local daily reporter in East Queensland, Scotland, became a Scotland television reporter in 1984.
He began to organize the events of the GMDW, IDR Prept and Deb, and then the morning event, which later became known to him, started.
He has been celebrating his 35th anniversary with a special event that reminds him of his unforgettable moments and interviews.
He, the editor, told me that he was the secret to standing on the television and that he had to work for you.
You must be honest and honest.
He added: “Be prepared first, and be zealous.

Zimbabwe: I was afraid of getting caught
One of the older officials said that the former president, Robert Mohamed, refused the offer of a chance to become greater when the revolution was at its height, and he feared that by November 2017, it might be a machine designed to get himself into military power to take power.
The last week, Zimbabwe’s Internald suggested that Nagang continue to take over the position of the greatest power for himself and the military during the revolution.
However, an older official in social media told him that he did not deny this opportunity because of fear, that he really had lost his position in the revolution, and that he was able to find out about the plan of Muhammad, using him to prove himself to world leaders and African leaders.
The 37 - year - old ruler of Zimbabwe was ready to hand over his authority to Singapore, but Eliezer was not with us, and he was confirmed by government officials that he was the senior officer of the Merber Office and minister’s senior office.
Seeing that Moses was exercising authority over his hands, the government officials said that Moses had approached Chicago through one of his messengers.
According to the chief of the chief government, there were three persons in the central center between the chief of the military and the former neighbors.
The official said that the most evangelical journalist of the conversation would include George Zámamba, Aaron Nuba, and Roman Catholic bishop of the Middle Ages.
Another man involved in his talk was the former president of the Zimbabwe branch of the Zimbabwe branch, Gigien Gombaba, who had been sent by the Zimbabwe branch to give Chianga (Esif) the best position in the country.
He was described as a symbol of Africa’s existence after his death, while he appealed to the heads of other African leaders, trying to prevent African cooperation from being approved by the military
The latter (Mgaba) chose not to be highly regarded as the CF (Sigans ’ general generals of the Holy Roman Empire).
He wrote that he had lost hope for the development of the situation that made it difficult for him to cope with, and he wrote that he was exhausted from a part of the hidden Indian family.
But there was even a measure of political strategy, and at least one of these would be to remedy the situation.
It would have been a struggle for them to keep their agreement with the African League of Nations, which would not be broken or damaged.
The hidden Ambulance (Escape) believed that the words of the general generals that he had lost his current CDF (Syngnical) machine would be confirmed.
In view of the situation, that belief (the cover) was the belief that the African League of Nations, which was so confused with how to take this on the basis of its theory of revolutions, would have pointed to revolution without any other way, so that the need for military intervention would have been to believe that the need for military intervention was.
That opportunity was given to reckon with the fact that the first human couple were created perfect, with the prospect of living forever on earth.
When the officials realized that the security forces were not ready to protect themselves, they said that Muhammad had taken this step.
They said that Muhammad was forced to write a Rajranam letter, warning him that the army would be in danger of being killed like the Caribbean.
The military commander told him that the citizens would not protect him from his onion because of the air conditioning.
At the time, he had two expectations that his family would be saved and that the military would prove to be a boon to the military.
The idea of the current CDF and the generals was correctly understood.
By means of a powerful illustration to the frustrated messenger, the older official said that he had been told that we were not politicians or political warriors.
By their men in Zimbabwe, government officials say that the country’s military chiefs are not eliminating their objective, but the military authorities say that he is concerned about the welfare of the prisoners around him.
In a short time in South Africa, while in South Africa, Muhammad tried to use the same UN to call us back to deceive us and to give us a chance to follow the way of revolution and rule.
Besides speaking with the military, Muhammad called for help from the territory.
South Africa, who was important to this practice-- not only because of their economic and regional strength but also because of the former Jacbne EZEZC leader, who refused to intervene but, as if the army had entered the house of Muhammad, as it had been a continuous retreat from the back, it made it clear that the Harre of South Africa would soon come.
According to The Independent of London, “the population of South Africa has grown to 1 out of every 4 people in the world, ” reports The Times of London.

The United States cannot control China, and there is no chance of preventing China’s growth.

A look at the surroundings shows that it is very unclean
Each year for Australia’s $2.9 billion - dollar - a - year journey, the Sydney port of Sydney is a huge part of the Sydney castle, surrounded by Obeira Hos, Szcair, Sr.
But being under the bridge is a grim fact.
Sydney’s famous harbor is one of the most polluted waterfalls in the country, with up to 15 Olympic springs per year.
This shocking statistics also make this area one of the most impressive places of our planet to attract tourists.
According to a new video known as Sydney Bridge and Down, all of them reach the harbor through the remotest waters of Australia’s most famous city of the most famous city of Australia, including clump pieces, plastic bags, bottles of distant shoes, clothes, and dead animals.
But plastic is the most important part of the process of stopping our waterfalls.
In harmony with September 27 of the world’s orbiting day, he said that as vice president of the Sydney harbor research program, Dr.
It looks beautiful to see, but it is one of the most modified and unclean toilets in our beaches.
Each hour, each of which is about 1560 miles [1560 km] of plastic comes into our waterfalls, and most of these come into the port through the raindrops.
Following some of the worst events of the day, the harbor... is in the worst condition, said Dr. Daffran.
One third of these pollutants are caused by waterfalls.
But while 70 percent of the plastics that come into the ocean reach the sea bottom, the problem of Sydney harbor is huge, like a ice mass below the surface.
According to Richard Nichols, administrator of the Malli de Necoss, the owner of the Malabar Center, only if you spend time under the water, suggesting that he and his team individually extracting plastic by 500 pounds [500 kg] each year.
Perhaps more people know (what is inside) will be shocked.
In the largest... half of everything we're finding is plastic bags.
The remaining 50 percent may be made of plastic.
When you look at the harbor, it is most beautiful, but people will not believe that there are all these plastics and garbage at the bottom of it.
The local and visitors have the same means of helping themselves with the same amount of fuel as the ozone layer and the waste that reaches our waterfalls, said Germ Bres.
He said he would start with the source of it, he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use and improve the quality of the process, and we need to be more alert that the way we go into our tubes finally reaches the sea.
If we destroy the sea, we will destroy ourselves, since 50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and food support.
But we can fix this port and bring back its back, which is very simple.
If we destroy the sea, we will destroy ourselves.
This video, a review of the development of DNA (TOMRA), as part of its wide - ranging efforts to stimulate the effects of the water supply that comes to the environment, agrees with a study of plastic and mental disorders that was released in this month.
In a survey of 536 children aged 12 to 18, 82 percent showed that plastic waste was also feelings of despair, and 25 percent blamed adults for the problem with plastic.
The study also showed that plasma is the fourth of the estimated number of thought - provoking 551 parents, while 93 percent of the thought - provoking parents are concerned about the most anxiety of the sea.
Many in the study said that we would like to do something about plastic waste but don’t know how to make a difference, which causes confusion about the environment.

Tasmanian dolphins can lead to cancer
Researchers have discovered a turning point in treatment for cancer that can lead to cancer.
Medical researchers discovered how some cancer cells hide themselves
Researchers found that the same procedure was done to the Tasmanian dolphins and humans
This discovery is expected to offer new methods of treating cancer patients
What is common with Tsimians and humans?
In the United States, it is estimated that 1 out of every 4 Americans suffers from cancer.
Researchers, including researchers from Melbourne’s Peter McKay Center, have developed a discovery that helps to create a revolution in treatment because some cancers have not responded to the method of treatment.
It may have a major feature of the removal of dangerous masks that threaten the future of the Tasmanian Devilles.
This study found how some cancer cells in humans and life - threatening cancer cells hide themselves, hiding themselves from a group of types of BRS2, unexploring a signal warning against cancer.
This may be a major challenge in treating short - cell lung cancer, a form of chlorophyll, and perchal cell.
‘ It is the greatest benefit of the program, ’ said President Mark Dawson Abe, director of the project, ‘ that at times we may be able to return to patients who are opposed to the disease - prevention procedure.
The disease - carrying proteins, known as mMM, can alter the purpose of current treatments to operate, and the immune system can detect cancer cells.
‘ It’s likely to have long - term benefits for those who have ovarian cancer, ’ said Professor Dawson.
‘ It is one of the world’s largest diseases.
We can treat it in a better way. The Bible says: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.
Researchers also believe that the discovery could eventually be used in masks of the Tasmanian deletons, which prevent the discovery of cancer cells in the same way.
Professor Dawson said that it is significant that the same procedure (both to men and to Tasmanian death) occurs in cancer.
Until this day, it was very difficult to treat cancers by the Tasmanian Delta.
But if you can use drugs that work with humans, it is likely to help control the disease.

Scientists are confused about the tiny orbiting of the largest planet
Scientists are amazed by the discovery of a sun family 30 light - years away from the earth that is around the tiny planet called the Red Twarf, which presents a challenge to the present understanding of the planet’s existence.
The largest gas - form of 3512 B, published on September 26, 2019, was the figure of a giant nuclear telescope around Red Twarf.
The stars are usually much larger than the giant planets that orbit them.
However, researchers said that the star did not have a major difference in the amount of planets.
While the star, named GJ 3512, is 12% of the size of our sun, it will be at least half the size of our orbiting planet, the largest of our solar family.
This is a very surprising fact, said the scientist Carlos Morlls Morelème, at the University of California, in the space plant at the University of California, in Spain.
This discovery was amazing at the point of a reference to the creation of theory that stars, such as the earth and the neutrons, usually consist of small planets.
In this, we have found a small star, similar to a comet like a comet, and Morels said that he had found him around a small star.
This gas - powered planet, such as Jupiter, was used by a telescope at the Geer Aldo telescope, in Spain.
It moves its star on its long path, which lasts 204 days.
Red twiffs are small and low - temperature on the surface.
GJ 3512 is not only smaller than our sun but only about 35% larger than the planet itself, which is somewhat comparable to a giant planet.
They reveal less energy than the sun, and their surface temperature will be relatively cold to Kilver (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit (6,327 ° C).
This is why he has a red color, as Morels said.
Morels said that while there is a basis for a second planet orbiting the star, a third planet may have been created from the star family in the past, which explains the elliptic path of the planet, such as Jupiter.
The planets form from the same layer of gas and dust between the cells that they produce around the star.
At first, as the primary model for the development of planets, called the virtuoso, a planet is formed from solid particles in the layer, and a way from the atmosphere surrounding the atmosphere is to form a way out of the atmosphere.
The pattern of a constant, steady gravity for this can be illustrated by this custom.
He said that in this case, he may be the largest and coldest figure ever expected by the protozoans around that star.
This allows the layer to be settled, so that some solid areas may appear.
These gems can grow as long as they are scattered, resulting in a planet being formed.

And the state president, the state president, has sent the court commissions to all district officials and police overseers to answer this matter.
In addition, the court has ordered that a bull be sacrificed only to the temple and its young to be taken into custody in all temples by the CCVs.
Now the state government has appealed to the Supreme Court against this decree of the Tartu High Court.
In 1949 the Supreme Court pointed out that the Supreme Court had rejected their claim not to violate their pledge to join India.

A joint appeal in the struggle against Australia
In the United States, according to the International Herald Tribune, the U.S.
Australia’s Adolescence will make them the most possible team to win in the D-Bre, to confirm the possibility of attack in the empty space with France or Argentina.
But if the Australian team beats the team for the last 15 of their last 15 visits, it will be forced to fight for the last eight years.
He has nothing to hide, and the two teams are trying to win the race and take the lead.
Some decisions were difficult in the past, but it was a delight to win a victory against them (Athalia) in the autumn.
I think they would be more determined than ever to overcome us again, but we want to make sure that we have another victory.
We knew that it was going to be an important contest before we came here.
Now we have come here, and the time has come for us to show real skill.
In history, the Wells team has won only one victory over the Australian, New Zealand, or South America, when it won the Australians 32 years ago in the race for the third place.
A collective trainer has only 7 of the 41 attacks against the three southern whites under the Wartburg.
Wells stopped the failure of the 13 - ton competition against Australia last November, one of the many who had participated in the sports stadium in Tokyo’s 9 -6 victory over that 9 -6 victory.
Before that victory, when asked if there was any emotional obstacle, the doctor added that he would find it hard to say it.
I don't know that those competitions were so difficult, maybe... that people thought there was something wrong with me, I don't know.
At last we left about 15 points in the race, and when we look at the points, it seems more difficult than they really were.
In order to win the Wells, the struggle with the famed Australian liner Michael Hupper and David Gücken would be important.
The Dyslexi, on the 67-time team, has fought the two players in several previous contests, and he knows exactly what's going to happen.
He said that the seven men were almost universalists.
You will always know that competition will be difficult when you encounter a world - wide array of rebels.
These two are fine proclaimers of the good news in the world.
You know what kind of competition you are going to face.
One of the world’s best customers in saving the ball is a thief who has a rifle in his right place at the right time, one of the best targets in the world, one of Michael’s best targets in the game.
You need to challenge yourself with the world’s greatest fighters rather than fight with back-line players who don't play properly.
You would like to play against the best hunters, and you should be with the best player when you play against these two soldiers.
I don’t say that I finish the race on Sunday, but this is our main competition in this world game.
A team’s efficiency is an important part of it.
If you continue to play well and express a fine activity, it may be difficult to overcome yourself.
Because the ocean level increases, the risk of drowning in the ocean is greater
With 27 ocean level rising, the United States and the United States, 4 Indian cities, such as Calcutta, Mumbai, Surrey, and San, have warned that time - tested civil change (AUCCC) was at the risk of drowning in the sea.
The Institute for Alcohol Abuse, which studied the effects of the HAO era change, published a study published by the Association for Disease Control and Prevention.
In it, by the end of the century, the lake would quickly melt and rise to the ocean level.
The risk of drowning in the sea is high in the 4 cities of Colombia, Mumbai, Suriname, and Senegal.
At the same time, many parts of northern India will face severe water shortages.
The sea level is increasing faster than ever before.
In the year 2200 B.C.E., people will be affected worldwide on a global scale.
In addition to the 4 isolated towns of India, 45 port cities worldwide are at a rate of up to 50 square miles [50 sq km], and there is a risk of drowning in the waters.
This danger is increasing every year, so low - lying seams and small islands are at high risk.
Moreover, unless there is an urgent action to reduce the global temperature, the sea temperature will rise and the oceans will be destroyed.
Sea food will be scarce on a global scale.
It is also possible to develop severe storms.
The sea temperature has doubled from 1982 to 2016.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health.
Essserters Spearers: After the earthquake of Whisnin, Ben Kamula kisss
As Viola Tanne (Shonoa McCurry) throws out and retreats to her boyfriend, the rush is giving way again in Easter.
But would the two regret having a relationship or an angry situation?
He recently said that it was nice to see Ben’s weak and gentle side to be seen in this case, even though his leg was helping to save his life, since he offered to help Papia Biley, and he and Ben, although he kindly dealt with things, were recently able to date, to see his weak and gentle side.
Today, he comes back from the vacation in a better spirit than he had when he left.
After learning that his unhappy marriage and the prospective husband had betrayed him, it is evident that being away from Fortham was the best for him.
When he comes home, his mind is tied to his leg.
But soon, a true lack of self - control that he manifests takes place. The Bible says: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.
James, who lives in the United States, admits: “I used to think that if I had more money, I would have to spend the rest of my life in the ministry. ”
When he is drunk, he is in a mood and has to go to Ben and fight the guilt of all that happens to him.
Ben is calm, takes the leg, heals him, and becomes an overwhelming emotional experience because of their long - awaited kiss.
But to what do they go headed thereafter?
The couple will try to date the next week, but Ben’s intense concern about his former relationships is a warning that damages all that the couple’s efforts to do.
But after proving himself to his homofoy, the new confidence - inspiring leg is determined to fight for what he wants.
The kiss is to be displayed in the PBC - INC series on September 8.30.
Since the White House is difficult to find in the bottom of which position the status is lost,
A man who knew the situation explained that for the past week, the white palace officials have been able to determine how to meet the renewed efforts of the democracies of the General Party to occupy the U.S. president, which has no solution for the new problem, the ‘ total shock ’ has arrived for the last week.
A man near the White House said that the charges made by the broadcaster could seriously affect the majority and those around him.
The man said that he was not sure that there was nothing there, he was.
There are white palace officials who are unsure of what to do, not because there is no open plan for the situation, but because the most common means of escape the church in the past would not be useful: He said it did not appear to be a matter that could disappear when the next news arrived.
Another person who learned these instructions said that the white palace has been struck by panic and shock, that if the trial continued, the higher the risk of getting into a situation that is beyond recovery.
When pressure is expected to increase daily during the trial of prestige, another one expressed the same concern as some around him were expecting that he would act better.
That, in turn, becomes increasingly uninhibited, causing anxiety that the behavior of the truck can be opposed in unexpected ways and that it can be taken in both conditions in the year of election.
At the moment of facing the threat of his high position, Robert Muller, who saw that he was capable of the Russian tiger, became an adult, and became a refugee from the Trimp attack style.
By turning attention to the activities of the democratic client and high - ranking patron Joe Byron, the broadcaster tried to undermine his desire to help the majority of the world’s political opponents, by throwing their confidence in him.
But the assistants and counselors said that this method was a different way of feeling, while many in the White House had had an experience of Muller tigers.
One person who knew this situation said that his visit on Wednesday had caused his loss of sight, while the name Aureer was considered to be a strong one.
They said that the question about Russian astronomy seemed to have appeared to be not in the attitude that would answer the questions about Ukraine.
Some people believe that the secret source of information has not been personally aware of the phone call between Trump and the U.S.
Moreover, the fact that, as often as he is walking, the greater part of the siege motivates his loyal ones to protect him.
But a layman who was close to the White House noted that the basic approvals of the Internet are already too high and that the approval of new ones cannot be obtained.
It is no good to concentrate solely on the financial status of the next four months, especially if it breaks down his legal cases and makes him an titled message.
Another observer claims that critics do not fully know what his answer would be like.
In the United States, for example, a government official in the United States has been asking for advice on how to help those who are concerned about taking the lead in the office.
While efforts are still at the beginning, the man who told about the plans said that the effort like the battle room might be beneficial or that it is still clear in the form of it.
He said that the one taking the lead in this was refusing to oppose public support of the one spreading secret report and that the report was acknowledging the need for organized legal and communications systems to resist the pressure of the public support of the public release and the report’s appeal to the status of the democratic Party.
One man who knew that the outside minister, Michael Bobborg and financial minister Steve Nachchwick, mentioned that with a keen awareness of not going to issue an explanation of the ransom, admitted that there was no way for the document to be transmitted after 48 hours later.
It is expected that there will be more pressure than Robert Muller's trial, who spoke only out of his charges. One who is expected to be involved in producing an answer to the promotion of position, said that he was Mr.
But to such an effort, the NPC News - Theologies said that the idea of taking the lead did not really exist.
For the past five years, I have done all I can to support the volunteers and his project, but he said that I did not give much advice about joining a team so that I could resist any effort to take a false stand.
From Muller’s trial, J. Seczyllo, the former lawyer of the train, is also without contact in the efforts to take position.
When the NPC News called on him, he said that we would handle matters at a suitable time.
While Meddfw, who served as chairman of the Mullin Court and led to the final trial, the lawyer of the White House had no similar experience, and there is no longer a lawyer in the White House who has experience in high office in high office.
A strange person of the White House said that there are no officials near the level of coherents or build - up rooms in the total, but he acknowledged that there was a need for an answer that all could get together and one who would be going ahead of the political struggle.
It is reported that in most parts of the country, there may be thundering rain in the evening.

Recoverable biological research can help reduce the output of smoking
It seems that in recent years, the electric cars and the Tessme Semics have been heading for news and that a respiration of energy has been flying out of control: Air Forces
But a professor of the University of Alberta has also developed a technology that can be used as a retrieval fuel.
Dr. David Brasler, professor of agriculture, life, and environmental science at the University of Alberta, began this process in 2003.
His study of hydraulic fuels has been creating high - pressure waste, such as food oil, animal waste, and carcinogen oil.
Unlike the engine and other organisms, this technology can use low oil in its production, allowing waste from other plants to reduce carbon output by about 85 percent more than fuel output.
This technology works to copy the hydraulics in the gas - based fuels.
He said that he was the first generation of microcarbons to produce the same hydrogen atoms that are molecules in Dixon.
In the process of providing a new choice for the use of biological fuels, previously developed biotechnology loses stability in low temperatures and causes a serious problem for a high - altitude plane.
He said that the problem of high - fuel fuel is like a useless Kate-22 problem, said Bresler.
In fact, its value is lower than that of the tea, but it is greater.
Bressler’s laboratory is now paying attention to two choices in producing life - fuel fuel for the plane.
First of all, their hydraulic fuel is another clean - up process of entering the hydrogen, less dangerous.
The second choice is to continue working in the chemical that has already been developed, which keeps the fuel in low temperatures.
Regarding the second choice, she said that she was able to play some games with the media at our restaurant.
There is much that can be done.
Since both airports and Canada and the American army are making more investments for a renewed choice, food production, food, clothing, and shelter continues to work for the company’s company.

It is expected that about 19 million gallons [19 million L] of fuel will be produced each year in this furnace.
Bressler also notes that while carbon output is estimated to be 85 percent reduction worldwide, the factors are the same how fuel production and production are not reduced.
He's a technical person, he's.
Bresler said that it would be to create choices in the way the information is presented and create different opportunities to choose what to choose.
The Supreme Court has decided yesterday to analyze the basic right of the right to be examined by Dr. Seikichi Schaffenen - Mohamed Shobe, who has been attacked by the bishop of the Inquisition’s Ministry of Justice.

In the request of the prime minister for peace, Britain may face such conflicts as the Los Angeles, the prime minister, and the prime minister, following the warning of the threat of peace.

The prime minister’s senior comrades warned that the fighting of the yellow shirts in France and the Los Angeles conflict in 1992 would be a global epidemic.
Mr. Johnsson asserted that he should reduce his anger in political terms, but he insisted that he would not stop using the word “constitution. ”

In the United States alone, 1 out of every 4 Americans is infected with HIV, and 1 out of every 4 people in the world is infected with HIV.
Now they have an example of a yellow - shirt struggle, as well as modern telephones to coordinate it, and only two well - known leaders are needed to encourage people.
In 1992 a riot broke out in Los Angeles following the court’s release of four white police officers in a case that the black driver hit Rhode King.
At the beginning of this year, disaster and destruction were caused in Paris’s streets for more than six weeks by French revolutionaries who were wearing high - eyeed yellow shirts against the French government.
The minister noted that in the lower atmosphere, Mr. Jansen warned that the hope of our political organization would be a disaster if the United Nations failed to break free from the European Union.
The minister said that if 66 percent of us say that he may join in the vote of 30 million people, he is still not satisfied.
Although 99 percent of them ignore, 100 more are really angry, and they write and ban the members of their division.
There is nothing great about it, and it will soon be thousands of people on the streets.
One senior cable minister added that if a second poll changed the end of the first vote, there was a danger of rise in the country that people would be in danger of rise.

The drought has caused floods and turmoil in many parts of India
The teenage years of India have increased almost a month, resulting in deaths due to falls by the never - seen rains, and a number of crops have died because of lack of food.
Usually early in September, the rains in northern India will begin to fall, but this month the average rainfall has dropped by 37% more than normal.
According to Indian weather researchers, if the situation continues in the rest of the days, this would be the last few decades.
The rain is still falling as far as never before in many parts of the country.
People walked through the streets, streaming into houses, and in the streets, such scenes were usually seen only at the end of the storm.
In other cities, such as Colombia, Latvia, and Haiti, there was strong rain.
The following rain has caused severe damage to homes in the state of Washington, D.C., in the north.
The summer rains began in the course of time.

What would be the situation if a government hospital was used for a variety of purposes, such as a bus stop, a free driving stop, a public report, or a public meeting of political party members?
That was the state of a government hospital in the Swiss district.
It is a government hospital that can treat between 1000 and 1200 patients daily.
There are a number of rules that should be followed where hospital stays are not too loud.
The U.S. government hospital is concerned about the absence of any of those around them.
The government and private calls are stopped just before the hospital’s entrance.
Even if the building is close to the hospital, they are stopped at the entrance.
The sound of those cries turns out to be loud.
The sound of the barbules is the sound of the victim’s voice.
In addition, private ambulances have escaped at the entrance of a government hospital.
The result is that traffic jams have been found in front of the hospital.

In view of the tragic effects of past storms, the disease is in full preparation to face the global drought.
It is estimated that 4,393 places are at risk.
In this list are the most dangerous areas up to 5 feet [5 m] of water.
Storms may strike at 12 coastal regions in the state.

According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, farmers may be able to choose the fast - growing motif fish and make more profitable.
In his report on this, he stated:
Farmers who feed farm farmers can quickly raise their young by selecting the rose - net fish they have developed.
The Tylophagou fish can live in less than a quarter of the world’s total population than other fish.
These are more resistant to disease and can grow faster than other fish.
And it is this kind of fish that you like most.
So farmers are asked to pick and raise gene - improved fish in their farm nuts and to make greater use of them.
Tallabis are ready to sell throughout the year at the government farm near the Kichikkis River.
Farmers can cultivate and benefit from their products.
Farmers who raise these fish should build their fish farm around and take care that the engine does not spread through the water levels nearby.
The Kashmir district fishermen had to record the fish farm at the development camp and then raise the fish in their fields.
In addition, the Ministry of Fishing for Details can be known directly or by means of the telephone called the Cafice Bay district, or 04-2449219.
The DNA tests on the lower human bones have been signed by a gravitation agreement.
In addition, The Encyclopedia Americana, and Harvard Medical School, have made a commitment that DNA tests the ancient human bones that were dug from the bottom of the country, the League of Nations, and the University of Harvard Medical School.
The director and director of the laboratory said: -
A link to the study will be signed by the physiology department, the Commology of the Communities and David Reagan School of Harvard School.
We believe that we will find most of the ancient human bones in our future ruins, lower, and original human bones.
These patterns will be sent to the DNA study.
This will especially reveal what kind of gene was in the human bones that were cut out in Tamil.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than half the world’s population suffer from malnutrition.
According to a new study, working with large - scale pesticides may be a cause of heart disease later.
The situation was the same in a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, followed by over three decades.
The researchers found that when compared with those who did not work with pesticides, the most frequently involved people had 45 percent of the risk of heart disease or stroke.
The study emphasizes the importance of using personal protective equipment at the time of insect - borne insects and the need to include in medical records for doing work and controlling regular heart attacks.
He is a professor of medicine at the University of Hawaii, Tokyo.
These findings have appeared from the data received to the more than 6,000 persons in Oho, who shared the heart scene.
Since only men of the Japanese family shared, researchers have noted that these findings do not apply to women or to other people.
Since pesticides have a long half - term effect, their effects on their health may appear many years later.
In this case, within 10 years the effects were seen.
After 34 years of operation, Rodrix said in a news item that he had never seen a connection between heart disease and stroke.
Since other factors related to age - related factors are important, there is likely to be a possible connection between insect - borne diseases and later heart disease.
Researchers found that there was no significant connection between heart disease or stroke to involve moderate levels of pesticides.

Elizabeth I’s lost garment is displayed in the court’s courthouse
It is made of the finest clammy furnace, planted with fallen silver sheets, and made into a fine manner of plants, animals, and butterflies.
In the historic royal palaces, it has only one word for Elylin, who is responsible for the collection of clothing.
The thin cloth that he saw, with 100 years ago laid down on the walls of a small rural temple, could be just a long distance from the original garments of Elizabeth I.
After three years in the temple in Hibernal, Hibernal, the last remote dress of the Divore, in the temple in Bakrford, was put to the show next month, over 450 years ago, in the same rooms where the queen was wearing it.
The importance of the discovery is that the garment of the 16th century is still one of the most popular.
While there is no key testimony that this garment was once worn by Queen Elizabeth, three years of research remains to the experts ’ view that the garment was a part of the royal family.
The beauty of the white - colored garment, the most outstanding of the royal family, and the great variety of plants and flowers produced, also shows the high status of the former owner.
When this council was created, it could have had a corresponding value to that of the Durer Manson.
Moreover, in the late 1950 ’ s, other women in the royal court would not have agreed to wear such fine clothing when they grew up to compete with him.
That was a big issue, so a number of commentators came and looked at it.
When they saw it, it was always satisfying to see what they saw at the time of their departure to wonder as the Word of God, and what they saw at the time was satisfied to see that it was one of the royal family’s content.
With a second long life in the clothing collection, the altar that was again cut out of the Most Holy of the Most Holy of the Temple in Baker could not be viewed as unexpected.
For the long life of the Queen of Bakton, Queen Elizabeth, he was the very closest village of the Black Dan, and local stories have long linked the jeepney with a long - term memory.
Although the cloth ran back to his death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth may have given it to the family, or the Persian temple, in 1603, before he died in the year 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of time saved, the altar’s over 400 hours of fine silk and fine surgery is being presented to the next display of the most famous of the ornaments of Elizabeth, showing that he was wearing a knife like that.
When you work with high - quality dress, you really respect those who have created them, says Libi Annsen, chief of security, most of its protection, most of its being held in the High Court of Human Rights, is just a small area where you can fit some of the precious scenes of the palace.
As I looked at the epigradary in front and back, I felt a great respect for the designers.
I had never worked in such a rich and prosperous garment.
Elizabeth’s lost dress on October 12 is displayed in the Hamburg court’s courthouse.

So the Ministry of Health ordered that the student be brought into the student’s work for the next year.
In the years to come, the biography and the handwriting will be brought into effect.
The student’s details are only made up of the student’s e - mails during the sessions of request, choice, and student combination.
So no one can cheat on it.
In addition to this, the Cududder and Jhorata, who had been subjected to trial, spoke to reporters.
