A study of the movement and communication between vehicles and private drivers is between two points.
Unfortunately, it is a bit difficult to analyze the traffic drive because a hundred percent cannot be calculated with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers show their control of automobiles into a reasonable range, resulting in a reasonable balance of traffic, and they are referred to as mathematically accurate.
To represent the traffic better, relationships are established between three main qualities: (1) race, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design, and activities of road facilities.
