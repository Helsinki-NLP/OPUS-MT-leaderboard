Due to the pressure of the surface, the steel needle is rising over the water.
The surface of the water has more water molecules attracting each other than the attraction between molecules and the air molecules above them.
Water molecules create an invisible form on the surface of the water, which is why materials such as the needle get up in the water.
A double hole of modern ice skateboard is surrounded by a hole, and 2 drops give a better grip even in the snowshed area.
Since the base of the blade is small, the blade is stretched from one side to the other, and the end associated with the ice will have curves.
This causes the skater to turn. The skater turns right when the skates are stretched to the right, and the skater turns left when the skater moves to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must avoid the excess energy they receive from the light.
This is a little bit of a photo-sharing thing that they do.
