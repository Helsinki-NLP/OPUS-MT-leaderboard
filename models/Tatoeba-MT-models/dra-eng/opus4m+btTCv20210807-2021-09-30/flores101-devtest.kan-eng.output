A vehicle flow is a study of the race and interactions between the two points of the individual vehicle and the vehicle.
Unfortunately, studying a vehicle flow can be difficult because one driver’s behavior is not measured by one hundred percent.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a reasonable range; therefore, traffic streams can also be consistently accompanied and represented bulk according to math.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
