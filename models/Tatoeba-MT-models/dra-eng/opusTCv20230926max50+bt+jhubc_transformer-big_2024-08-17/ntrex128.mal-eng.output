Members of the Welsh Assembly worried about 'sitting like fools'
There has been some confusion among some lawmakers over a proposal to change its designation to 'MWPs' (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal arose because there was a plan to rename the Assembly, the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Congress across the country have expressed concern that such a move would be controversial.
An assembly member from the Labour Party said his party was worried that "the name has a pronunciation similarity with the TWP and the PWP."
To the readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, "TWP" means "stupid" and "PWP" means "stupid."
A Plaid PM said her group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested other names.
He said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but that the transition from MWP to "Muppet" was a short phrase jump.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a draft law on the renaming, said: "The final decision on the description of what to call the members of the Assembly will certainly be discussed among the members."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public opinion poll, and it received wide support from the public to call the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the designation of members of the Assembly, the Commission favoured the names of Members of Parliament or WMPs, but in the public opinion survey, the name MWP received the most support.
It is clear that the assembly members are suggesting other names, but the fight to reach a consensus is likely to be a headache for Elin John, the presiding officer, and he is expected to submit a draft law on the change within weeks.
The law relating to reforms would also include other changes relating to the manner in which the assembly functions, including disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
When the law is debated, the Assembly members get a final vote on the question of what they will be called.
Macedonia is set to vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The vote is set to settle a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has its own province known as Macedonia.
Athens had long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represented a claim over a territory of their country, and Athens had consistently rejected that country's requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Georg Ivanov, who is the opponent of the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the name change is only the price to be paid for becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Mary's Church in St. Mary's is closed due to flooding
"Historically, the oldest people I've spoken to have said there was a bar and a mosque at every nook and corner," Mr Adams said.
“There’s no two today.”
He said he understands the bars are closed.
"These days, people interact with each other in different ways," he said.
"People don't have living rooms in bars anymore to go on a regular basis."
In the case of churches, he worries that the money from selling the property will not last as long as leadership expects, "sooner or later they will be back to where they started."
He added that apartments with rented rooms full of people who do not support the remaining wildlife centres in the area can be built in place of churches.
"Most of the people who are buying the rental rooms in these buildings will be white," he said, "so it will be faster to get to the day when all the churches close together, because most people who move to these rentals are unlikely to be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white churches, Harlem became a black hell, Harlem became a metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist church moved here in the 1930s.
The nearby church of the black worshippers gave the building its own name.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of blacks under Reverend John Howard Johnson, and it was Reverend John who led the boycott of small merchants on 125th Street, as the main place for shopping in Harlem, the street was too small to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to renovate the building, and they commissioned Carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin, proudly called Carillon, "the bell of the poor."
The expert who read Carillon in July described it as something else: "a cultural treasure", "an historical instrument that cannot be changed."
This was the first carillon in the world to be read by a black musician, according to Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan. This black musician was Dionysio A Lindh, who moved to a much larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merry Weather, the St. Martin's Church could not find anyone to replace him.
The complex story of architects and contractors has been heard in St. Martin over the past few months, some of whom were brought up by the church's alma mater, some by the Episcopal Diocese.
Vestry, the parish's governing body, which includes Almaya leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns, saying that although Vestry had nothing to do with hiring the diocese's architects and contractors, the diocese "must pay" the diocese money.
Some residents complained about the lack of transparency.
13-year-old drowns in lobster pond in California
Authorities said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was drowning in the sea on Saturday, the opening day of the shrimp season.
The attack took place near Beacons Beach in Encinitas at 7 a.m.
While diving in the sea with his friends for about half an hour on Sunday morning, he heard a boy screaming for help and his friends came to his side and took him out of the water, Chad Hammell told KSW B-TV in San Diego.
At first, I thought it was the sound of a baby crying, but then I realized that it was a baby!
He later told me that he knew I had a crush on him.
"His whole thigh was torn open," Hammel said of the incident, which caught his attention when he found the baby.
“I called everyone to come out of the water and said, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>There was a shark in the water!’”
The child was airlifted to San Diego Rady Children's Hospital, where authorities said his condition was critical.
The species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, a life guard, told the media that a few weeks ago he had seen a shark in the area, but it was determined that it did not belong to the shark's endangered species.
Giles added that there were trauma injuries on the upper part of the child's body.
As part of the investigation, authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the Swami in Nesinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but they are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's to capture UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is set to compete with brands like Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening department store-style beauty shops that employ specialist assistants.
As part of its focus on the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, Sainsbury’s plans to open <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Beauty Isles’ in 11 stores across the country, and if this becomes a success, Beauty Isles will open more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty sector comes as part of supermarkets' effort to take advantage of the shelf space used for TVs and microwaves.
Sainsbury said it will double the number of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, and these products will include brands such as Revlon, SC, Tweezermann and Dr. Paupau for the first time.
Current product lines such as L'Oreal, Maybleline, Butts Beas, as seen in shops like Boots, will get more space with similar branded spaces.
The supermarket is once again introducing the boutique makeup range, and most of the products will be vegan-friendly, and it is these products that young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Sainsbury's stores will experiment with perfuming retailer Fragrance Shop allowing discounts, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Brimingham later this year.
Now we see online shopping and the tendency to buy daily food in small quantities from local convenience stores, which means that a lot of work needs to be done to entice people to visit supermarkets.
"As supermarket chains battle discounts such as Aldi and Liddell, which sell more services and non-food products, the outlets will be more like department stores,"" said Mike Cooppe, chief executive of Sainsburys."
Sainsbury's is opening hundreds of stores with argros outlets, many stores have also introduced habitat outlets, and Sainsbury's acquired both of these chains two years ago, making it more profitable to acquire chains.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate the beauty department and pharmacy department was unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots, but the collaboration ended after disputes over sharing proceeds from the chemist's stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacy stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Adding a unique array of expensive skin care brands, including La Roche-Posey and Vichy, to the four stores, the company said Lloyds will also play a role in the project.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, commented: “We have changed the appearance of our Beauty Isles to improve the environment our customers get to enjoy.
We have also invested heavily in hiring specially trained assistants who provide advice and suggestions.
Our range of brands are designed for all purposes, an attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we have now become an increasingly attractive destination that challenges the old way of shopping and customers can’t avoid.”
Peter Jones 'extremely angry' as Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 deal with Dragons Den star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on deals with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to spend on a clothing and accessories brand.
People have compared the business of these pairs to that of Gyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 30-year-old announced on Instagram that he was retiring.
Holly Willoughby's last-minute withdrawal from the lucrative lifestyle brand business angered Dragons' Den star Peter Jones - who pulled out of the deal to focus on his new mega-deals with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Those close to the pair revealed that Jones was upset when the Golden Arrow on TV agreed during a turbulent meeting at Jones's Business Sa Kingdom headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that he had no time to set aside for the accessory brand Trully, as he had received new contracts - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The world compares their business to Ginette Paltrow's Goop, which if continued in the business would have more than doubled Willowby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truely, Jones left the UK by plane to go to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truli has been one of Holi's priorities for a long time.
It was a long-term project that could help Holi financially for the next one or two decades.
The decision to withdraw from the tournament came as a shock to everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, as the launch of the initiative was due to take place soon.
At Marlowe headquarters, there is a warehouse full of goods to sell."
With large investments in products ranging from cushions and cantilevers to fabrics and household items, experts believe that the withdrawal of one of Britain's most economically able stars, the Morning Appearance, will be a huge liability for the company and the delay of the launch.
It was the end of a long friendship between the two of them.
Willoughby, a mother of three, had been friends with her husband, Dan Baldwin, Jones, and his wife, Tara Cappe, for nearly ten years.
Willoughby Trulli started with Cap in 2016, and the 52-year-old joined as chairman in March.
The couple enjoys a vacation together, and Jones owns a forty percent stake in Baldwin's manufacturing company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Willoughby as the host of I'm a Celebrity, ITV's show and McPartle.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business affairs."
After a good fight, we fell in love.
He slammed the media for what some might consider to be "incompatible with the president" and expressed hope for the North Korean leader.
Why did the government give up so much?
Trump said he was playing "fake news."
"I didn't leave anything."
Trump noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June, which he hailed as a big step towards denuclearization in North Korea.
Nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was missing any "relevant response" from the US on North Korea's initial denuclearization moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. would continue to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a more optimistic view of his campaign.
"We have a very good relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a good relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results, such as halting rocket tests, helping to free the hostages, and bringing back U.S. servicemen's remains to their homeland.
He justified his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"Speaking the way the president should, it's easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get in and out of this confined space, we'll have about 200 people who are standing right now," Trump said.
The earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people on the island.
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they did not need their help.
Although more than ten percent of Lombok's population has lost their homes, it has not been declared a national disaster and is a pre-requisite for international assistance.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they are very clear about not seeking international help, which is a bit of a challenge," Ms. Sambang said.
Though Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear if foreign officials will be able to work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Response Force, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to the relief efforts.
Considering the magnitude of the earthquake that Indonesia has had to endure, the country still remains unprepared to face the ravages of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Asiha, it is not a common sight on other seashores.
Although the warning is in effect, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu is likely to add momentum to the loss of life.
Even with the best of weather conditions, traveling to many islands in Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters have made the transportation of goods more complicated.
The hospital ship, which was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, has now departed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
During his election campaign, President Joko Widodo promised to improve Indonesia's fragile infrastructure, but he also spent money on roads and railways.
Mr. Joko is facing re-election next year, and the lack of money has made his administration miserable.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian issues that have crept into Indonesia, and the country's Muslim majority wants to adopt a more conservative form of faith.
Christian gangs and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets with knives, bows, arrows and other deadly weapons, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's consolation goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute in a match at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Pass Sturridge from Zerdan Shakiri was received when he was about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal post, at which point Liverpool were 1-0 behind.
Sturridge hit the ball to his left before striking the ball in front of the post.
This effort propelled the ball over the box and left the ball facing the right upper half of the net.
The ball fell to the body of Kepa Arisabalag and finally shook the net.
"I was trying to be in that position to get the ball, always pushing the ball as far as a player like Shaw could, so I tried to make the time as long as possible," Stridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw the car running, I touched a ball, and then I didn't think much, I took the shot."
Chelsea took the lead in half-time with a score of 1-0 after Belgian Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In that match, the Blues striker gave Matteo a pass before turning roughly in the middle of the field and rushing into Liverpool's half.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic took a quick "Give-and-Go" pass.
He then led Hazard to the box and gave Kovac a beautiful throw ball.
Hazard, who was driving the defence, hit the ball with his left hand and the ball shook the net over Liverpool's Allison Becker.
In the group stage of the Champions League, Liverpool will face Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will face Videotone in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia's disaster agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the tsunami had risen to 832.
Sudupo Parwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference that several people were reported to be trapped beneath the debris of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude quake, with waves as high as 20 feet.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is scattered among the ruins of collapsed buildings.
The police have arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
A murder investigation was launched this morning following the discovery of a woman's body in Brickenhead, Merseyside.
The body of the 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at the Greyson Museum on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have appealed to those who saw or heard something unusual in the area to come forward to provide evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagan said: 'The investigation is at an early stage, but I request those who live and have seen or heard anything suspicious in and around John Street in Brickenhead to come forward to provide evidence.
I also request everyone, especially the taxi drivers, to contact us, as there may have been some visuals in the dash cam footage of the drivers, as such information may be crucial for our investigation.’
A police spokesman said the owner of the body was a resident of Briggsham and that their body was found inside a property.
A group of friends arrived at the crime scene this afternoon, believing they knew the deceased woman, to ask questions about where her body was found.
Police said they are investigating the matter and are trying to contact the victim's family.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Muse, had tried to get into his flat, but people were prevented from entering or exiting the building, police said.
The taxi driver was stunned when he saw what happened.
Residents have now been informed that entry into and out of the building will take hours to reverse.
I've heard people say that the whole area is a crime scene.
He saw a woman standing at the scene of the crime crying.
They said it was "extremely bad."
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the Coroner's Office and one outside.
A group of police officers watched from inside the building.
Anyone with information is asked to send an email directly to the <0x40>MerpolCC address or call 101, or call Crimestoppers without informing the name on 0800 555 111 by saying "247 30 September."
The most recent monumental demolition of the Parliament has been caused by the "disruption of history" scandal.
The removal of Cromwell's statue should be called poetic justice, as England's cultural and religious artifacts were destroyed by his fanatical Puritan followers, as the Taliban did.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "ridiculous" and an "attempt to distort history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, commented: "The current debate over the removal of the statues made it inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, erected outside the Palace of Westminster, would become the target.
The events during the English Civil War were never at Cromwell's command, nor did Cromwell.
It is now being offered as a false cromwell for events committed by his predecessor, Thomas Cromwell, in the previous century.
The magnificently built Cromwell statue is proof of the 19th-century opinion of Cromwell and part of the history of a leader that many think is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "He was, in the course of his authoritarian rule, one who protected Parliament from pressure from external forces, and now more than ever, at the end of the 19th century, many, perhaps many, were counting Cromwell.
Whether it is a complete and accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation over time, and that Cromwell is a recognized individual leader who represents one of the two factions that divided and fought.
His achievements as a 'Lord Protector' should be celebrated and remembered."
A Chinese farmer was killed.
According to local media reports, a farmer was killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man known by the name of 'Yuan' was found dead next to a pig in a market in Lupanshuu, Guizhou province, with his blood vessels ruptured and his body lying in a pool of blood.
On 30 May 2001, a pig farmer prepares vaccines for pigs in a field in Sining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man had arrived with a relative from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell his 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his family found him dead, and a pig was found in the open.
The family said there was a large amount of blood coming out of the victim's mouth.
According to the report, the pig, weighing 550 pounds, was beaten to death by the farmer.
The man, known as "Woo," said he had "full blood on my cousin's legs and all of his legs were amputated," according to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market to feed the pigs at around 4.40 am on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The killer was not the victim or his family.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone, while police collected evidence from the scene of the murder.
Reports suggest that his family and the market authorities are in talks for compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have been documented in the past.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a well-to-do farmer was hit by a 650-pound pig tractor and his wife saved the pig.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon, whose pigs had been killed and eaten, was told by a Manitoba charity that pigs were generally not aggressive, but that the taste of the blood could act as a "catastrophe."
"They are playing.
They're biting, they're inquisitive... and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect," the farmer said.
Heavy rain is expected in the southwest of the U.S. as Hurricane Rosa closes in.
According to the weather forecast, Rosa is weakening as it moves up to colder seas off Mexico's northern coast.
However, heavy rain is expected across northern Mexico and the southwestern US over the next few days.
The storm is expected to make landfall at a speed of 85 meters per hour as of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, making it a Category 1 hurricane and setting off 385 southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected to move south on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a cloudburst has begun forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards and reaching the west coast of the US. With the arrival of Rosa on the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin pushing heavy tropical moisture northward into the southwest of the US.
On Monday, 10 inches of rain is expected in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical humidity and approaching cloudbursts will counteract and in the next few days, the southwest is likely to receive widespread to heavy rainfall.
Rains of 1 to 4 inches can cause sudden dangerous flooding and landslides locally, as well as landslides in the desert.
In some areas, particularly in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona, heavy tropical humidity can result in rainfall that can reach 2 to 3 inches per hour.
Southwesterly areas, especially over Arizona, are expected to receive anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, there is a possibility of sudden flooding as conditions may deteriorate rapidly.
It is strongly advised not to travel to the desert during the rainy season.
Heavy rains will turn the canyons into torrential streams, thunder and lightning, causing localized turbulent winds and dust storms.
The approaching cloudburst will bring heavy rain to parts of Southern California's coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is expected, possibly resulting in small-scale landslides and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the area.
Rains will continue to fall through the night and into the morning on Monday and into Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread in all four directions and will continue till Wednesday.
As the Arctic Ocean cools but the tropical wave continues to be really hot, there will be intense temperature changes in October across the US.
Sometimes, this can lead to dramatic temperature changes between small distances.
A perfect example of dramatic temperature fluctuations across the central U.S. can be expected on Sunday.
Temperatures vary by about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis, Des Moines and Iowa.
Over the next few days, the nest will begin to grow and develop again.
October is expected to warm up over most of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures ranging widely from the southern plains to parts of the northeast to as high as 80 degrees.
Temperatures in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which can be an average of about 10 degrees higher.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the western U.S. through the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial was watched by more than 20 million viewers.
More than 20 million people watched testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has been accused on six television networks of sexual harassment by Brett Kavanaugh in 1980.
While broadcasters disrupted regular programming for Friday's last-minute turnaround, political parties continue to distance themselves on the issue, as did Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who signed an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had sneaked into his high school party and had tried to undress him.
I am 100 per cent sure that nothing has happened, he said.
On Friday, Nielsen reported that more than 20.4 million people are likely to see it.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership information from the Met networks that aired the news, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, is not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen has technical difficulties in counting the number of people who sit in offices and watch television.
Explaining this, it has the size of a football match or an Academy Award audience.
Commenters on the Fox News channel, which strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, said Nielsen led to an average of 5.69 million viewers across all networks during the entire day of the trial.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS received 3.1 million viewers, while NBC received 2.94 million, MS-NBC received 2.89 million and CNN received 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the trial, the public interest in the matter continued to rise.
It was the highlight of Friday's fireworks.
The moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, and on Friday morning, protesters shouted slogans against him as he tried to get into the lift for a judicial committee hearing.
When the crowd booed him, he was seen looking down for several minutes.
"I'm right in front of you," the woman said.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
"You have the power when so many women are powerless," someone told him.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he had more to say at the meeting of the committee, before the door of the lift was closed.
Later, at a time when the committee voted to decide whether to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote, all cable networks and broadcast networks broadcast it live.
But Flack said he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee next week, a demand made by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced through conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
The decision was made after a series of meetings with Mr. Cruz and several other senators.
Flake's decision had force because it was clear that the Republican Party did not have the votes to approve the Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister says Brexit 'playing politics'.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May said critics of her plan to leave the EU were "playing politics" with Britain's future and were "playing with national interests."
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Brimingham on September 29, 2019.
On the front page of Theresa May's interview, she also included an interview with Boris Johnson, a former foreign minister, who reinforcing her attack on Theresa May's "checkers plan for Brexit" by calling the UK and the EU's proposal to keep tariffs on each other a "total travesty."
Dayton Simpson, LSU football player shot dead by police: Police say he may have been involved in the shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Simms.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of "a second degree murder."
Authorities have released video footage of the fight between Sims and Simpson, in which Sims' glasses were lost during the fight.
The police recovered spectacles from the scene of the murder and DNA samples of Simpson were among them, the CBS sister agency WAFB reported.
When Simpson was questioned, he admitted that he had fatally shot Wade, police said.
He is expected to sign a $350,000 bond.
East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office on Friday released a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for helping to carry out the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Allewa thanked the law enforcement authorities in the area for their "wild vigilance and efforts for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-year-old forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
In one match last season, Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "in a big shock" after learning the news of Wade's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The Popocat<0xC3><0xA9>petl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital city.
The National Center for Disaster Management on Saturday warned Mexican residents to stay away from the volcano for more than 24 hours after the face of the volcano became operational and recorded that gas and ash had been released.
Several trees and plants were being monitored.
Like Xochimilco, images of people showing ash-thickness on the windows of cars in the vicinity of Mexico City were circulated on social media.
In September 2017, geophysicists noticed an increase in volcanic activity in central Mexico, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico.
The volcano, which has been active since 1994, is known as "Don Goyo."
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of an election year.
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona following clashes between pro-independence protesters and police, with thousands taking part in demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's referendum on independence.
The police action came after a masked mob of pro-separatist protesters threw eggs at the police and hurled dust canisters, creating black clouds of dust on the streets that were normally crowded with tourists.
The police resorted to lathicharge to control the violence on the streets.
As pro-independence groups chanted slogans for several hours, unionists shouted, "Don't forget, don't forgive," and anti-Spain protesters chanted, "Let Spain last forever."
Local media reported that 15 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but more than a year after Catalans supporting the split celebrated the referendum, tensions in areas with independence are high.
Although the majority of voters supported independence, the majority of those opposed to the partition abstained, so the number of voters was small.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were snuffed out last year in clashes that broke out when police tried to end voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-freedom groups had camped throughout the night on Friday to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the show went ahead, the performers were forced to choose another route.
Sixty-eight-year-old Narcissus Termes, who was attending a secessionist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's future in independence.
Last year was the best year of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are embarrassed," he said.
Although regional elections last December saw a small but significant victory, the parties supporting Catalan independence are struggling to maintain momentum this year, as some of the best leaders have either fled or are under house arrest, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
Forty-two-year-old John Pewg, a mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone, said leaders on both sides of the dispute were igniting an argument.
"Things are getting worse," he said.
Oriol Junkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before trial since late last year, announced on Saturday that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we are seeing from the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate in the European elections," he said.
London: A man has been arrested after a car crashed into his home.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballinagarh Crescent on Thursday, around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
There may have been a crossbow shot in the car.
Meng's 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Mengha's first goal for Livingstone led the team to victory.
As a manager of Ibrox, Livingstone was shocked when he handed the second defeat of the season to Steven Gerrard in 18 games.
When Holt's team was promoted and Hibernian came in second place, Doli Menga became a different kind of goal.
Gerrard's team remains without a win in the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they will face Harts, the leading team with 8 points more than them.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, their unbeaten run in the division has expanded to six games, with Holt replacing Livingstone, who replaced former coach Kenny Miller last month, yet to taste defeat.
Livingston missed the best opportunities given by the visiting team.
Holt's team should have been far ahead even before they scored, as their direct moves have given the Rangers problems of all kinds.
While Scott Robinson managed to penetrate into the face of the opposing team, Scott's effort was wasted on the face of the goal, and Allan Lithgow also took the ball towards the face of the goal, but Craig Halkett's head was returned.
The hosts Livingston, who we knew could confuse visitors with their performance on the ground, were happy to allow the Rangers to play in front of them.
That's how this main character was born.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and then Livingston tried an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson bringing the ball to Meng, Mengahayat, passing the ball from the centre of the box and scoring the goal.
The Rangers had the most time with the ball at that stage, but the defense of the host team was unbreakable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained unchallenged.
Although the ball was blocked by Alfredo Morelles, this pattern continued until the second half.
Scott Pittman also tried to score but the Rangers' goal did not yield, and Lithgow in the Livingston-style hit from the open field, but the ball was out.
Crosses continued to come into Livingston's box, but they were all wasted, and two penalty claims against Glenn Middleton, who came in as a substitute, were dismissed by Halkett Foul, who was accused of showing him a handball.
"Breakfast" from Lidington
Tony McCormick at the BBC Scotland's Alastair Lamont at the Arena
A legendary performance and the result of Livingston.
They did a great job of keeping their hopes up.
After returning to their top spot, they rarely changed their style of play or their team-mates, but Holt's ability to hold the team together after he took over should be applauded.
The club had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding in his ability to keep a well-prepared defence in order, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worrell active throughout the game.
There was a lack of motivation.
"When they were under Gerard, they played superbly, and from that level, they were very down.
They didn't have the finishing ability and only once did they get in the face of the host team's goal, which was a warning to the Rangers as they are currently at the bottom of the points table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and blue skies.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit - a visit aimed at improving ties between the NATO allies.
They also discussed human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then left for Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
It is the largest city outside of Turkey.
Police lined up security reasons to prevent a crowd of around 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters of Erdogan had gathered on the premises to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also voiced their disapproval of Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The protests and cheers reflected the division between some German Turks seeing the visitor as a hero and others as a dictator.
Pedestrian dies in road accident
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident took place at around 10:15 BST, near the junction between Best Wood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and was examined by paramedics, but died at the scene.
The incident comes less than a month after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and contact his family.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted, and motorists have been asked to avoid the site of the accident.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in encounter inside prison
Six prison officials were injured in the attack on a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and the rioting is still going on.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to bring the situation under control, and the encounter, involving eight prisoners, takes place inside a wing.
A small number of wounded soldiers were treated at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "The HMP has deployed specially trained prison staff to deal with the developments that are taking place on Long Latrine.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries.
"We will never condone violence in our jails, and we will hand over those responsible for the violence to the police, who may have to spend more time in jail."
The HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, there were reports that the prison's governor was being treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, prison staff were attacked with pool balls by inmates, and officers who were trained to control the violence to manage a serious encounter were sent to jail.
The threat of Hurricane Rosa over Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which may be beneficial for areas with severe drought) raises the risk of flash floods.
Such a tropical depression over Arizona is a rare phenomenon, but it is precisely what is going to happen when, early next week, the remnants of Hurricane Rosa travel into the desert to the southwest, causing a sudden flood.
The National Weather Service has already warned of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday for places from western Arizona to eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct route over Phoenix and arrive on Monday evening, accompanied by rain.
"Since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have been brought within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a cyclonic storm within 40 miles of the AEZ border," the National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of rain, and isolated rainfall of up to 5 inches can occur at Arizona's Mogollon rim.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, but may receive a total of up to 1 inch of rain.
In the case of areas where there is no risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by rosa may become a blessing as the area is facing severe drought.
Though flooding is a serious issue, as the South West is currently experiencing drought, this rain is likely to be beneficial.
"According to the U.S. Draught Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the second highest category of extreme drought," Weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa makes its first landfall on Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm's effect on cold water in the Pacific will reduce the strength of the winds.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the shores of Mexico by Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of the tropical winds.
Heavy rain is expected across parts of Mexico, which poses a risk of sudden flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of 10 inches in some places," Weather.com reports.
It will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching Arizona's border early Tuesday morning, and then through Arizona and into Thetan Utah on Tuesday night.
"The major risk expected from Rosa or its residual power is very heavy rainfall occurring in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the US Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to be accompanied by sudden floods that are life-threatening, landslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four men charged with attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenager was found with bruises on the Excelsior terrace in Midsomer Norton area around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
The injured child was admitted to the hospital and the child's health continues to be "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man have been arrested from the Radstock area of Evon, Somerset police said.
The officer requested that if anyone had mobile phone footage of the incident, they be handed over to the police.
Trump said he had to bear the Democratic Party's 'little bits and pieces of anger'.
"""A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to protest the ruthless and unfair tactics of the Democratic Party,"" Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia."
Trump said Kavanaugh had to bear the Democratic Party’s <0xE2><0x80><0x98>little bits and pieces of anger’ throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted when she was a teenager.
Ford also gave an affidavit during the trial that his allegations were true.
On Saturday, the president said the "American people have seen the brilliance, quality, and courage of Kavanaugh."
"Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote given by a judge with a history of ten years of public service and by one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time," he told supporters in West Virginia.
While talking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
"We have only five weeks to make one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I run everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to "defend and deter."
With regard to Kavanaugh’s nomination, the aide of a senior GOP leader told CNN that the first important procedural vote on the Senate floor would take place on or before Friday.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people, the death toll is rising
At least 384 people were killed on Saturday when large waves swept away several beaches following a massive earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said.
When hundreds of people gathered for the festival in the city of Palu on Friday evening, waves as high as six metres (18 feet) slammed into the land, destroying everything in front of them and killing hundreds.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"Even when yesterday's tsunami threat was high, there were people on the beach, people who didn't run away suddenly because of the warning, victims," Sutupo Parwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, said in Jakarta.
"Not only did the tsunami come, it swept away cars, logs and houses, it swept over everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour).
He said that some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and they managed to escape.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
In the aerial footage released by the Disaster Management Agency, many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges collapsed and a mosque covered with water was also seen.
On Saturday, large waves following the end of the tsunami continued to batter the beaches.
2.4 In an area inhabited by people experienced a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than a home atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency said the city's geography, located along a long and narrow coastline, may have added to the tsunami's strength.
Nugroho said the damage was "vibration" and thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were recovered from beneath the rubble of the collapsed buildings, with 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the so-called "dongala," a coastal area about 300 km north of Palu and located near the epicentre of the earthquake, could be at risk of more deaths and damage.
Nugroho also said that the communications were "interrupted without any information" from Donggala.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that volunteers were heading to affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but there's a way to make it even worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was widely blamed on Saturday for not warning that there would be a tsunami in Palu, but officials explained that the waves were blowing within the time the warning was issued.
An amateur footage of a man giving a tsunami warning to people walking down the street from the top floor of a building is circulating on social media.
Within a few minutes of the explosion, buildings and cars were engulfed in flames.
Reuters has not yet confirmed whether the footage is authentic.
Power supply was cut off after the earthquake and tsunami, and authorities had difficulty coordinating rescue operations as communication systems throughout the province were disrupted.
Officials said the military had begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the survivors were left without food and other basic amenities.
The city's airport will remain open only for rescue operations, and the airport will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palau refugee camp on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia is more than 800.
The conditions are bad.
According to Mr. Dosebo, the staff members of World Vision escaped the tsunami and reached the city of Palu and though they were living in tents made of tarpaulin in the courtyard of their own office, they passed through the sights of destruction.
"I've seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The conditions are very bad.
Though relief teams have begun to take the lead in relief operations, some have complained that foreign volunteers with well-skilled skills have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign aid, materials and volunteers can only be used if the government declares a natural disaster a national disaster.
It has not yet been declared a national disaster.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can make preparations for international help, but that's not the case right now."
It's the second night in Palu after Friday's tsunami, and friends and relatives are hoping for the return of those who have lost their lives due to natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers had rescued a woman from the rubble, who was lying next to her mother's body.
For the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month, two of the paragliders trained by Gendon Subando, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, went missing in the tsunami.
The others, including Mr. Mandagi, who were stranded at Rowa Rowa Hotel were also his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding industry, I have my own emotional stress," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Rowa Rowa hotel, the news spread among the paragliding community and that he sent frequent WhatsApp messages to the milk contestants who participated in the beach festival.
All of the messages received only a gray check mark instead of a pair of blue check marks.
"I don't think the message has been conveyed," he said.
$26,750 was stolen while filling an ATM in Newport, Lewes
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, in Newport, Lewes, on Friday, thieves stole $26,750 while the Brink officer was filling the ATM.
Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release that the driver of the car was trying to refill an ATM empty in the complex for entertainment purposes.
While he was working, another person "run away from the back of the Brink employee", stole the bag of money which was being brought for delivery.
Eyewitnesses have seen multiple suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, the press release said, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the perpetrators can call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper says his name is 'Ya'
The rapper West changes his name to "Ya."
On Saturday, he wrote on Twitter: "The man officially known as Kanye West."
For a time, the 42-year-old was nicknamed "Ye" by West, who used it as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change comes ahead of a live telecast on Saturday night, during which he is expected to release his new album 'Yandhi'.
The show's creator said West was coming in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, who left the show for "emotional reasons."
West had previously said the new name was an abbreviation of the current professional name and that the word had religious significance to him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and 'yes' means 'you'," West said earlier this year while discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So, I am you, I am us, we are all us.
I went from Virgo to what you mean by single - whether we are good or bad or confused, this is our reflection.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is one of the most famous rappers.
Sean Combs, known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P Daddy, or Daddy, said this year that he would like to be known as Brother Love.
The rapper Jay-Z, who had previously worked with West, had changed his name without hyphenation or capitalization.
Mexico's president-elect says he won't use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andreas Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has said that he will never use military force against the common people as the country marks the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
At Tlatelolco, Lopez Obrador said he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, a peaceful demonstration at Plaza de los Muertos, in which about 300 people were killed, marked the beginning of the left-wing student movement in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support the younger generation of Mexicans by allowing a monthly subsidy for students studying and by opening more public universities.
He said that the lack of education and job opportunities is leading to unemployment among the youth.
The U.S. needs to double its artificial intelligence funding.
Cai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner, has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, demanding the US double the amount it spends on research in the region because China is increasingly active in artificial intelligence.
Kai-Fu Li's comments came after various departments of the US government issued AI declarations even though the US does not have an overall official AI policy.
Last year, China set a goal of becoming the world's number one innovation destination by 2030.
"Considering the fact that all other countries are far behind the U.S., doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we are looking forward to the next leap in AI," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding means that the next big AI breakthrough is likely to be in the U.S.
The book titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published by Huffton Mifflin Harcourt and is now CEO of Synovation Ventures and Li has invested in Phase<0x2B><0x2B>, China's most important AI company.
In 1980, he built an AI system at Carnegie Lelan University, beating the highest-rated American Othello player, and later worked as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee praised the impact of U.S. government technology contests, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when there would be one to contact the next philosophers.
Lee said researchers in the U.S. often struggle to get government funding.
"It's not China that's taking the best from the academy, it's corporate companies," Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired graduates from universities to work with AI.
Lee said immigration policy changes may be able to help support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think people who get PhDs in AI should be able to get a green card naturally," Lee said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council released its <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan’.
Just as the National Science Foundation and other government institutions fund US researchers, China’s National Natural Science Foundation also funds people in academic institutions, but the standard of academic activity in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an initiative aimed at engaging stakeholders from industry and academia, and the White House has announced the creation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
Earlier this month, Dabra announced that it will invest $2 billion in AI Next.
NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
For months, there has been no action on a U.S. law requiring the creation of a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence.
Macedonians have voted in a referendum to change the country's name.
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move aimed at finding a solution to a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's bid for membership of the European Union or NATO.
Since Macedonia is a province within Greece, Greece takes the name of its northern neighbour Macedonia to represent a claim on its territory, and thus Macedonia's requests to join NATO or the European Union are blocked by Greece using its veto power.
The two countries reached a compromise in June regarding the new name, but the nationalist opposition argues that the renaming would weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's population of the Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that this minimum requirement might not be met, as at least 50 percent of the votes needed to be valid for a referendum to take place.
The plebiscite was marked with a ballot that read: "Do you agree to membership of NATO and the European Union in accordance with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the name change is a price that Macedonia must pay to seek access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO; Macedonia is one of only two countries to have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come to cast my vote today for the young generation of Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which means a more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 69, of Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would abide by the results of the referendum.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, in the 2016 parliamentary elections, 66 per cent of the registered voters cast their vote, while the voting percentage was 36 per cent in a bell, compared to just 16 per cent in a plebiscite.
"I came to vote for my children, Europe is our place," said Jose Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zayeh, his wife Soria and son Duzhkum cast their votes in a referendum on the name change in Macedonia, which opens the road to joining NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, where plebiscite boycotters had set up tents, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardhakov set up a small stage and pulled up chairs.
"We are not opposed to joining NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the head held up, not through the back door," Kawardha said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can request help from China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Tsai Ing-wen said the investment will bring in the required investment and NATO membership for Macedonia, which currently has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe a large majority would support the name change because 80 percent of our citizens support both EU and NATO membership,” he said after casting his vote.
He added that the result of "want" would be "the confirmation of our future."
Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said on Monday that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the plebiscite - a percentage lower than the required percentage.
Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said on Monday that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the plebiscite - a percentage lower than the required percentage.
Seventy percent said they would vote "yes."
To be successful, a candidate must get 50% of the vote and one vote.
Failure to pass the plebiscite will be the first serious blow to the government's policy towards the Western world, which took office last May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is on the verge of breaking Britain's entire defence line
Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday saw Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling strangle their opponents.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute came as easily as it could have been.
At the beginning of this effort, this Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field.
Before hitting the ball into the open field, Aguero bounced through three British defensive players.
Aguirre is surrounded by four green jerseys.
Aguirre pushed a defensive player and tricked several defensive players in close proximity to the face of Britain's goal.
When he saw Sterling on the left, Aguero handed the ball over.
Be that as it may, the English forward returned to Aguera as soon as he got the ball, and Aguera then shook the right side of the net by tricking Matthew Ryan, the goalkeeper for Britain.
"Aguera has retail problems in his leg," Pep Guardiola, the city manager, told reporters.
"We told him we wanted to play for 55 or 60 minutes.
Thats what had happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But in the Premier League, Sterling was the initial priority for Sky Blue.
That goal was scored in the 20th minute.
In that game, Aguero got the ball on the British border.
Leroy Sains left-arm spinner Aguirre bowled a beautiful throw to the right-arm off-spinner.
The ball hit the ball for a while and then it was handed over to Sterling who was climbing forward.
The Sky Blues forward smashed the ball into the net before it reached the boundary.
City will take on Hohenheim in a Champions League group match at Rhine-Necker-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday.
Sherlock Holmes wants to play the game of thrones.
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-offs, there's no reason to look for another start.
But Sherzer, who has always wanted to compete, wants to get back on the field Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but this will only be a reality if the Rockies still have a playoff mentality, and the Rockies have the lead in a match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but are still trying to win their first division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, knowing the atmosphere in Denver, where there's a lot of crowds, we can rubber-off at our fingertips, and that's going to be at the top of any point I'm facing this year.
Why can’t I compete with that?”
The Nationals haven't yet announced a starter for Sunday, but it's likely that Shermer, who has expressed interest in such a scenario, will be allowed to do so.
Sherzer, who is set to make his 34th start, threw a bullpen on Thursday and will be on his natural rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has 18-7 from 220 2/3 innings this season, with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike outs.
Trump's trip to West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the nomination of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we've done so far will depend on the outcome.
We have only five weeks to make one of the most important choices of our lives.
The biggest one - I'm not contesting, but I'm actually contesting, and that's why I'm running everywhere, fighting for the top candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see the terrible, terrible terrorist-inspired gangs of Democrats, and you see what's happening right now.
They are determined to come back to power by any means necessary, i.e., with the slightest of decency and decency as you can see.
They don't care who gets to get power and control, they don't care who gets to trample on whom, they don't want power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to "defend and deter."
Asked "what have you seen in the last four days," Trump said, "Democrats are full of anger, depravity, bigotry, and dishonesty."
When the Senate Judiciary Committee ranked Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by the name of Trump, the audience roared.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you put it in the paper?
Oh, oh, what.
"No, no, no, I'll wait for it - that's really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a big party.
He will not forgive those who repent.
I'm not surprised that my local councillors voted against it.
I'm the last member of the Labour Party to say that I don't agree.
I had the same experience with my parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, who stood up for antisemitism.
"In my case, I was criticised by Thackeray for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, Jeremy has disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues, such as responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe.
The notice for Saturday's Notingham East Labor Meeting stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In my nearly eight years as a local Labour MP, that's how Friday night's GC meetings have been.
Sadly, that’s not the nature of many meetings today, and over the years people have forgotten the promise of “more kind, more gentle” politics; of course, if such a promise ever began to be made.
It has become increasingly clear that in the Labour Party different views will not be tolerated, and each opinion will be judged by whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It began as soon as Jeremy became leader, and my colleagues, who had long held a political view similar to mine, hoped that I would go in the opposite direction and take views that I never agreed on, concerning national security and the European Union, a single market.
Every time I speak to the public, regardless of what the issue is, there is a plethora of scepticism on social media; some people say that I should lose my MP status, I should quit central politics and I should not be in the Labour Party.
This is not my experience alone.
I'm definitely luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments that come to me are related to political issues.
I am proud of the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racial harassment every day and who never shy or lower their heads.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is that the levels of temptation seem to be natural.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer an enlarged church, and the party is narrowing down every time a "no-confidence" motion is introduced, or changes in election rules.
Over the last couple of years, I've been getting a lot of advice, advice that I should keep my head down and not speak so much, so I'm going to be "correct."
But that's not why I'm in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was a school student. I was angered by the indifference shown by Thatcher’s government to the fact that my entire school classroom was really falling to the ground. Then, as a local councillor or government minister, I always tried to provide better public services to those in need.
I didn't vote in any election, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham is likely to be confused about my policy understandings and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
"To those who promote Friday's resolution, I just want to say that while the country is moving towards a Brexit that hurts homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the ambition to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I really want to give a message not to the Nottingham Moment, but to the Labour Party followers and non-followers in my constituency: I am proud to serve you, and I can assure you that, for threats to blow my title or political takeovers, I cannot be deterred from interfering with what I believe is in the best interest of you all.

1x17 - Lost in the Middle of Nowhere
While the previous two draws may have nearly dented the final result, it is certain that Ori deserved a win in today's surprisingly interesting Tennents Premiership match.
These two teams are the top 10 teams in the table.
In a nutshell, the team was propelled by great defense and their courage to test the possibilities, and coach Peter Murchi has every right to rejoice.
"We've played every game we've played so far, and we're happy with that," he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie commented: "Yes, Ore is right, they have been at the forefront of testing the possibilities."
Frazier Climo scored the goal in the 14th minute for Grant Anderson, leading the Ore, but through the Warriors, the yellow card given to Scotland's cap Rory Hughes for the match gave Melrose a chance, but Jason Buggot's attempt was fruitless.
The ore was delivered to Climo Lead with a penalty, and before that it was almost half time when Climo made a solo attempt to reach the target, which Aririn was able to do with an interval score of 17-5.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and when Patrick Andersen's effort got them to Buggot's goal, they were able to reduce the difference in scores to 5 points.
Ruarid Knott suffered a serious injury, and the game was halted for a long time, and Ore rebounded when the match resumed, and Stafford McDowell's effort helped Clemmo reach the goal.
Then the temporary captain of the ore was given a yellow card, and Bruce Colvin was unable to take advantage of the chance given to Melrose, who was in a vicious circle of extreme pressure.
Although the home side began to bounce back, at the penalty lineout, MacPherson made an attempt by jumping to the advancing ore side when Hutchinson received a yellow card for dismissing Clem without a ball.
Clem again scored as he did when the match resumed, before David took the box from Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry off the edge of the field for the home side's fifth attempt.
Searching for new opportunities in the restaurant industry
The matter came to light when Ford took over as director of the still-game star Ford Keiran, a restaurant company that had been licensed.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes himself and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner Greg Heffley.
The star couple has announced that the ninth series will be coming out soon, and it will be the show's last series, and it looks like Kiernan is busy planning his life after Craig Lang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adrift Mon Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, but a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan would focus on Glasgow's "growing rental business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia hopes the court will open a path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
A blue flag is hoisted in government buildings.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the same slogan: "The ocean belongs to us by right.
We need to get it back."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the bloody dispute over resources in the 19th century that forced Chile to cede its coast - once again a desire to sail across the Pacific Ocean.
While this hope has been in the air for decades, it is at its peak now, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, which has been under deliberation for the past five years.
"Bolivia now has a sense of momentum, unity and calm, and the country certainly expects the outcome with a positive outlook," said Roberto Calsadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, and they hope the tribunal in The Hague will sympathetically look at Bolivia's claim that, after decades of volatile negotiations, Chile is obliged to consult on allowing Bolivia to have a path to full power to the sea.
Bolivia's influential local president, Evo Morales, also faces a controversial battle for re-election next year.
"We're close to getting back into the Pacific Ocean," he vowed last August.
According to some analysts, the court is unlikely to pronounce the verdict in Bolivia's favour, because even if the court declares in its favour, nothing is going to happen.
The UN body, which is based in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to adjudicate on a matter within Chiles territorial jurisdiction, and has stipulated that the outcome of potential negotiations will not be determined.
Paszarote, a Chilean expert on international law, said the ICJ's ruling comes just six months after final arguments, suggesting the case was "not complicated."
Instead of advancing the goal of Bolivia, the developments of the past four years may have been a setback to this goal.
"The current Bolivian government has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Sartre said.
The aggressive rhetoric of Morales may also have spilled over into what Chile may have had in mind for Bolivia, she noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at times, but it will be more difficult after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Welts<0xC3><0xA9>, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was extraordinarily fast.
He said Monday's ruling would give Bolivia a "wonderful opportunity" to "open a new era of relations with Chile" and "end its 139-year-old disagreements related to bilateral benefits."
Caldwell has denied the claim that Morales is turning the maritime issue into a race for his political gain - and that he is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents.
"Bolivia should never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"It's an opportunity to change the way we look at the past."
North Korea won't denuclearize until the U.S. does.
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho said the country would not denuclearize itself unless it could trust Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began trying to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy talks in Singapore, three months after a summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said the continuing subplots and the U.S.'s obstructionist approach to the declaration of an end to the Korean War were just a "pipe dream" that would ever drag North Korea on its knees.
At first, Pyongyang was reluctant to agree to the declaration without significant disarmament measures.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
Given the potential to be seen as the only way to ensure the security of the nation, there is widespread uncertainty as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning a warhead.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The latest line-up of the huge collection of hats that will soon be on the High Street near you is displayed in a Parisian fashion
If you want to increase the size of the hat collection or completely cover the tail, there is no need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a line of oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway.
This summer, Instagram has conquered hats that seem to be completely impractical, and these designers have brought their eye-catching creations to the ramp.
Valentino's master piece was an over-the-top light brown cap with broad edges, like a swamp-like feather standing on the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with ornaments, a witch's hat, and a pineapple - but these hats were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also illuminated a collection of strange facial expressions, many of which are adapted for use by Halloween.
These eye-catching colours stitched the lips of many, and these masks reminded Hannibal Lecter more than Horticulturists.
One creation reminded me of a complete scuba diving gear with snorkel and goggles, while the other was more like a melted ice cream cone.
If you live in a big city, you're in luck.
I'm sure you'll be able to find these types of hats in stores soon.
These large-sized hats came in the form of 'La Bomba', a two-foot-wide edged straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajowski.
The cult label behind the no-practice hats, which quickly went viral on social media, led to another huge creation, which was a strap-on beach bag, about the size of a swimsuit, and the models wore it on a ramp.
La Riviera was a creation from the collection of Paris Fashion Week's La Riviera SS19, a brand new orange raffia bag with a white handle on top.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to Fume: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the High Street next summer <0xE2><0x80><0x93> because the designer has made a big impact, so it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.’
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, with another set of exceptional exam results, which continued in 2018 as well, with individual and collective success in sports, music and other community endeavors, strengthening academic excellence.
Represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and home to over 30,000 students across Scotland, the schools strive to provide the best quality of service to students and parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare students for the future of higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as global citizens.
As an education sector which can design and implement an exemplary school curriculum, we see that modern languages will continue to be popular and an aspirational choice subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to a person in an understandable language, it goes to his head.
But if you speak to him in his language, go to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that when you want to build relationships with people from other countries and win their trust, you can't rely on English alone.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that the languages top the league lists with the highest success rate within independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
Data collected from SCIS schools, which have 74 schools as members, show that 72 per cent of students scored a higher A grade in the Mandarin language while 72 per cent of students studying German, 69 per cent of students studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish earned an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that children and students will need in the future.
Languages are now considered a elective subject, as are STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of the reasons that challenged the hiring of candidates for the posts were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more essential to prepare students for future employment opportunities.
These skills are indispensable in a globalized world, as languages are essential for future employment.
Whatever the career path you choose, if the candidates have learnt a second language, they will really get the advantage in the future as there will be long term expertise like this.
The ability to directly communicate with people from foreign countries, a person who knows multiple languages, will naturally be far ahead of the competition.
In 2013, a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to initiate a conversation, compared with only 15 percent who said French was the only foreign language they knew.
That's why investing in language teaching is becoming so important for today's children.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those with language proficiency in developing countries, gives children a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
While a handful of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, like Mandarin or Japanese, other schools will teach languages that are considered to be important to the UK by 2020.
Whatever your childs interests, there are always a handful of languages to choose from within independent schools that have teachers who specialize in the foreign - language field.
While we do not know what the future holds, Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children to succeed in life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed.
In a global business environment, it is no longer a matter of denying that languages will continue to be an indispensable key element for the future of the country, and therefore should be reflected in education as well.
Of course, modern languages really should be treated as "international communication skills"
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for children in Scotland.
The Fair in Ai Fouth Bien.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
Lebron will play for the Lakers on Sunday.
Here's a look at some of the players LeBron James is expected to play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against Denver Nuggets in Santiago.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"Times can be longer than one minute and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudel, a reporter for Lakers, tweeted that James would only play for a limited time.
Following his first training session this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is scheduled to begin campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies planned for next week, in places where he has a lot of followers, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to ensuring the vote for his nominee on the Supreme Court, Trump also aims to increase popular support ahead of the midterm elections in November, as fears are rife that the Republican party will lose control of Congress when the polls are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. (Eastern Time).
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below, via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s trials of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose case has been tainted by sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, as the FBI is investigating the matter and the Senate has extended the Senate confirmation vote by a week.
The primary goal of this election is to give the Republican Party a little boost in the run-up to the November election.
So, the goal of the five rallies next week is to "encourage volunteers and supporters as the party seeks to maintain and increase its Republican majority in the House of Representatives."
"Congress's control is very critical to the president's agenda, and so as we heat up campaign events, he will visit states as often as he can," a spokesman for Trump's campaign programs told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally, which will be organized at the Wesburn Co Arena in Wheeling, "will attract followers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and gain the attention of Pittsburgh media".
Trump visited West Virginia last month, and it will be his second visit with Saturday's rally, in which Trump won the state by more than 40 percent of the vote in the 2016 election.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican senator, Patrick Morris, who is far behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for him that the president has to come in to give Morris a lead in opinion polls," Simon Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. women's team to play in semi-finals on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Forsoms’ may have been exactly what was needed for this year’s Ryder Cup.
While the dynamics of the constantly changing game are purely a fabricated command, it's something that players actually believe in, especially in games like this.
If so, where's the proof now?
"They were six points ahead, now they're four, so I guess that's a little jump ahead of us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the match.
Europe has four points from 12 games and is currently leading the table.
However, as Spieth puts it, Americans feel that the wind is a little bit in their favor and there is a lot to be proud of. The quality of both Spieth and Justin Thomas' game is nothing short of what motivates them. They have played together all day and are proud of the fact that the two of them have been able to score three to four points each.
The "Grey's Anatomy" star is a role model for others.
After playing two games, Spieth and Thomas were two points behind, and the celebrations got even louder when a vital <0xE2><0x80><0x98>putt’ (Panthurutty Pit) was sped up to take the match to four all-squares.
His dog, who won the match in 15, also received the same celebratory calls, which he told people he believed the American team was not out of the game.
"What you really need to do is be deeply aware and concerned about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for the players.
18 points for a perfect score.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players in the last two days to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Two of the four were from Europe, but none of the four were from the United States.
The only pair that didn’t take a bogey shot on Saturday afternoon was “Mollywood”. But they dropped bogey shots on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, then played the last nine holes on Friday morning.
They are the players to beat on Sunday, which reinforces the game and the way their energy seems to flow back and forth from the noisy crowd. When the sun sets on Le Golf National, there will be no players more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to ensure a European victory.
It's better to play different games at the same time.
However, talking about European glory has remained a thing of the past.
Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foreballs, while he was playing in pairs with Alex Noren, Bubba Watson and Web Simpson worked hard.
In the first nine holes, a bogey and two doubles threw the Spaniard and the Swedes into a pit that could not be salvaged.
No one is going to stop you on Sunday.
It's interesting to see the closeness between the pair, the advice they give to each other, the lack of advice they give to each other, and the way any strategy can change in an instant.
Europe, who have played well as a team so far, are going into the final day with a good lead. But this foursome session has also shown that Team USA, some people, especially their country, have a fighting spirit.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe, which emerged from Saturday's Foreballs and Foursomes games with a 10-6 lead over the United States, is heading into the Ryder Cup with a healthy advantage for the final day.
With two wins over Tiger Woods, the motivated pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their way to their four-point lead at the Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Jorne, who was trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hasseltyne two years ago, dominated the American side, which reached the series 3-1 at Forboles early in the morning.
The U.S. showed more resistance at Forzams by winning two games, but not by slowing down.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the title.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Mollywood" after a thrilling weekend, are the only second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the foreballs, they came together to defeat the self-defeating Woods and American newcomer Bryson DeCambau in a much better 5&4.
Woods, who pulled off a two-match winning streak on Saturday, has now lost 19 of his 29 matches at Foreballs and Foursomes, seven of them consecutively.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copke 2&1 in the world rankings.
However, on that comfortable, windy day in the southwest of Paris, Europe couldn't have it all.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
At Foreballs, they won a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Polter, and later at Forsembles, Polterge and Rory McIlroy, who lost the opening two holes, returned to beat 4&3.
Although Furyk's side needed a draw to keep it as trophy holders, it has only returned from a four-point deficit in the Ryder Cup's history when a team has gone into singles twice.
After a couple of days, it looks like they're going to be on top of the world on Sunday.
North Korea says 'no way' to unilateral disarmament because it doesn't believe in it
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions would increase distrust in the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong said at the United Nations' annual General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken "substantial steps to name a few," including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling its nuclear test site, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any similar reaction from the US," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, we cannot have any confidence in our national security, and we have no way of first unilaterally disarming ourselves in such circumstances."
Although he rebuffed familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past; North Korea should benefit from the step-by-step approach.
Mr Ri mentioned that at a summit in Singapore on June 12, a joint statement was issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in which he pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and pledged to ensure the security of North Korea; the summit was the first to be held in Singapore where an active US president and a North Korean leader had met.
North Korea has been trying to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease existing severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is forcing 'first nuclear disarmament' and increasing the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by force, even opposing a 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The idea that we'll be overwhelmed by obstacles is a pipe dream for people who don't know about us.
The problem is that because of continued sanctions, our distrust is growing."
He did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader said at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Referring instead to three meetings in the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, he said: "The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a tragic end had the South been the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament, and not the United States."
Even so, the tone of Mr. Ri's speech was dramatically different from what Mr. Ri had preached at the UN last year. Mr. Trump called Mr. Kim a "rocket man" and said at the United Nations that it was a "suicide attempt" and that North Korean rockets targeting U.S. Mainland were inevitable.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was "no problem" whether it would take two years, three years, or five months.
China and Russia have been arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the actions taken so far.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “We must remain active in implementing the sanctions recommended by the Security Council until complete, final and verifiable nuclear disarmament is realized.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has been fruitless.
Although he left Pyongyang claiming progress had been made, North Korea denounced him within hours after he left, saying he had made "the same demands as the gang."
North Korea had promised in a meeting with Moon this month that it would dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar measures."
He said he had been told by Kim that the so-called "similar measures" were security guarantees promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn the course to get enough sleep.
This year, a new course was introduced for all students of Harvard University to get more sleep, in a fight against the growing "macho" culture of sleeping all night with caffeine in it.
One academic found that students at the world's number one university often lacked clarity on the basics of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Seesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Briggsham and Women's Hospital, who believes it is the first course of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after delivering a lecture on how sleep deprivation can affect learning.
“When I finished speaking, a girl came up to me and said, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>I’m in my final year now, why are you telling me all this?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This course, introduced for the first time this year, provides students with the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their general well-being.
The university decided to introduce the course after students were found to be suffering from severe sleepiness during the week, said Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Services.
The one-hour course included a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door room, where when students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, they can hear about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep hygiene.
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation increases students' risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages students to think about their signage routines.
"We know it won't immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke."
"There is still a culture that takes pride in saying 'learned without sleep', which means that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem," he said.
Ensuring that you get enough quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - while not sleeping to avoid gaining weight, we are pushing the brain into a state of starvation, which results in constant hunger.
Raymond Zo, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped design Professor Sisler’s course, which Raymond attended in his first year at Harvard last year.
He has stated that the said course opened his eyes and prompted him to conduct the said course throughout the campus.
As the next step, he expects all post-graduate students to be asked to complete a similar study plan, before joining a competition-based institution.
Professor Seissler recommended that students should consider the time of sleep and wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting; this blue light can lower your circadian rhythm in a non-traditional way, causing problems with sleep.
Livingston Rangers 1 <0xE2><0x80><0x93> 0: Menga’s goal defeats Gerard’s players
When Dolly Meng's foot left Steven Gerrard's crumbling team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingstone, the Rangers once again felt they were far from their permanent left.
Since their 4-1 win at St Johnston in February, the Ibrox side had been looking to record their first away match win, but as manager of Gerrard, Gary Holt's team conceded just the second defeat in 18 games, eight points behind the Ladbrokes premiership's unmanageable hero, Hartz.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but the under-inspiring line-up of the Rangers didn't look like it was going to bounce back.
The Rangers are now down to sixth, while Livingston slipped to third, only behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
It would be more difficult for the Rangers to take care of Linsman Kale and Spencer when someone threw something on the back of their head.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that made it to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, put down the same Livy 11 that scored a point from Harts last week, and that well-trained team must have made him so happy that he outclassed his opponents at every stage.
While the Rangers may have dominated the position, Livingstone has handled the ball well.
They should have scored as soon as Menga's first layoff pass sent Pittman to Allan McGregor's goalpost in the second minute of the game, but the midfielder squandered his big chance.
Kagan Jacobs's frigid approach to captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Allan Lithgow was only able to hit a missed shot to the back post.
Although the Rangers took control, there was more than confidence in their forward line-up.
When Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lowless met in the fifteenth minute, it seemed certain that he would receive a penalty, but referee Steven Thompson rejected the Columbian's appeal.
In the first half, the Rangers had only two shots on target, but a header from Lassana Colibaly and an enthusiastic delivery from Ovie Izaria did not bother Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
The goal in Livy's 34th minute may be against the course of the game, but no one can deny that they deserved it if only their consent was taken into account.
The Rangers once again failed to manage a set piece of Jacob's super-skilled set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher delivered the ball to Scott Robinson. Robinson did not let go of his composure and chose Meng to complete the simple.
At the interval, Gerard reacted by dismissing Ryan Kent as the replacement for Colby. The change was almost a shock. The winger made a move with Morlos, but the heartthrob, Kelly, jumped out of his line to block it.
But Livingston kept the visitors in the game to their liking. Lithgow and Halkett took long shots one after the other.
Holt's side could have pulled off their lead in the final stages, but McGregor continued to deny Jacobs and Lithgow opportunities.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' replacement, argued for another late penalty when he sided with Jacobs, but Thompson again denied it.
Pantheon: Inventor of the Geiger counter
Now a page from our “Sunday Morning” calendar: September 30, 1882, today is the 136th anniversary of the birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter, which has since become an important reference for science, has also become a major reference for pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that make up the radioactivity in the mineral."
Evan: "Tell me, it's definitely broken!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
However, his name is still in use today.

It is a method of segregating immune cells from a patient and transplanting them into a lab.
Then, they can "see" a common protein that causes many cancers, and then inject these cells back into the patient.
A trial vaccine in patients with a variety of cancers has shown promising results.
When a woman was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize sluggish cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for a period of more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein, known as HER2, that causes many cancers, and then injecting these cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Prof. Berzofsky explained that HER2 influences the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach that takes immune cells out of patients and teaches them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating leukemia.
After his presence at SNL, Kanye West has gone out wearing a giant hat and a pro-Trump rant.
But it's not Asia.
After an unrelated performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run in 2020, Kanye West was booed by people during Saturday night's live show.
After wearing Make America the Great hat and singing the song titled Ghost Town, the third of that night, he lashed out at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, they say, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>How do you like racist Trump?’
"I would have been out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a skit starring Matt Damon joking about Brett Kavanaugh's affidavit before the Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding sexual assault rights raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though not broadcast, footage of West's futility was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
As of this writing, it's not clear if West will be re-signed.
He also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him to wear a hat in the show.
"They scared me in the hallway.
She said, “Don’t wear that hat.”
They threatened me!
They say I'm in a sinking place," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the place where you've drowned? Wear my Superman cape because what this means is that you can't tell me what I want to do," he said.
Try it with love.”
Listening to his comments, audiences were stunned at least twice by the cuckoo and SNL cast members, Variety reported, where one person told the publication: "The whole studio fell into the silence of death."
West has been replaced by singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
Many people were surprised to hear her sing the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TP USA, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous souls: Thank you for standing out in the crowd."
West, who hosted the talk show, tweeted: "He was just the way he was, and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I wouldn't decide to give a reward (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") to someone I believe is embracing an ideology that is harmful to my community and spitting it out.
He is free.
And so are we," he added.
Prior to the show, rapper West had tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he was "officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and West followed in the footsteps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg, a fellow rapper from the West, changed his name to Snoop Lion, a symbol of the musical legend Prince, who was previously known as Prince.
He was charged with murder in a shooting at a local restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballia, the police said.
The accused is expected to be produced before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will review the charge.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been charged with sexual assault
Kit Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of Macho Hero, saying that young boys believe that he needs to be tough to be respected for such roles on the screen.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said she believes "something went wrong" and asked how she could solve the problem of toxic masculinity of the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to his co-star in Game of Thrones, Ross Leslie (31), admitted that he believed he was "sure" that the issue needed to be addressed.
“I feel very, very strong now personally <0xE2><0x80><0x93> where did we go wrong with regard to masculinity?” he asked.
“With regard to the problem we’re seeing right now, what are we teaching growing boys?”
With so many masculine characters in TV shows, Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What do you think young boys should be taught on TV and on the streets?
I think that's one of the biggest questions of our time - how do we change this situation?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In an interview, he admitted that he would not make the prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer and that he was "tired of the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West remake, which tells the story of a film producer and a spoiled brother.
The best thing that brought him out of Game of Thrones was that the actor recently revealed that he thinks he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so that show gave me a future family and a life moving forward," he said.
In this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played the character of Kit's lover, John Snow, played by Yegrita.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Lesley's family estate in Scotland.
China reports 14% increase in new cases of HIV/AIDS
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been affected by the disease.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of blood transfusions from infected individuals.
However, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province that the number of people infected with HIV in this way has almost disappeared.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 a year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem among the LGBT community in China.
China made homosexuality a criminal offence in 1997, although discrimination against LGBT people remains severe.
Because of the conservative values that continue in the country, studies have speculated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women themselves.
Sexually transmitted diseases often occur because men do not receive enough sexual protection when they have sex with each other.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV drugs universally available since 2003.
Maxina Waters has said that the data of her staff and GOP Senators were not leaked and that such allegations were "dangerous lies" and were a "conspiracy theory."
US Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information of Republican U.S. Senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages
The Los Angeles Democrat stressed that these were just claims being made by "extremely right-wing" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orin Hatch of Utah, according to reports.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an anonymous person from Capitol Hill during the Senate panel’s hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The data was leaked online shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Hill reported that conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters' office and released information of a member of Waters' staff.
"This allegation is completely false and completely false," he said.
There have been compromises in the identity, personal information and security of one of my employees as a result of these false and misleading allegations, but my employee is not responsible in any way for the leakage of this information.
This allegation is completely false and baseless.
Waters's statement online drew criticism from critics, including former White House press secretary Rice Fletcher.
"There's an anger in this denial," Fletcher wrote.
"This indicates that they do not have the sensibility to become a Congressman.
No one should be angry about something they haven't done.
We must not be dishonest.
Do not question the motives of the accused person.
We need peace and quiet."
Fletcher was trying to compare Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's trial.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If that's the case, it's a big deal," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that the office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement of these bogus claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are brought to light and we will also ensure that they will be held legally liable for all their acts which have caused destruction and danger to all my employees or any of my employees," she added.
Johnny English Strikes Again review <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Rowan Atkinson’s powerless spy spoof
It has now become the norm for any new British-oriented film to seek Brexit prominence, and it seems to apply to this second part of the 'Johnny English' action-comedy spoof franchise - a franchise that began in 2003 with the film 'Johnny English', revived in 2011 with the film 'Johnny English Reborn'.
Is this counter-intuitive self-satisfaction related to the issue of how absurd we are, and will it become a new export opportunity for the country?
Whatever the case may be, a rubber-faced, incapacitated Johnny English has a license to fatten things up a second time - an extensive comic strip designed for non-English speaking, cinematic audiences.
Of course, he is a dull secret agent, and despite his odd quirks to graceful charisma, he was made to feel like an inspector close-up, as Mr. Bean's pedigree is mixed with a handful of fads and a handful of young fads contributing a single note to the 'Chariots of Fire' theme tune at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is actually based on Atkinson, a traveler and eccentric man of mystery, who once starred in a series of now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
This latest Johnny English release has one or two good moments.
I loved the fact that John was in the middle of the movie, with a bit of a back and forth between the two of them.
Atkinson's ability to play physically is evident in the film, but the plot lacks power and is strangely overpowering, especially in a time when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now confidently adding comedy as an ingredient.
The humor in the film feels more childish than adult, and I didn't feel Johnny English's crazy adventures were fresher or more concentrated than the silent movie melodies that Atkinson played as Mr Bean.
The UK is in a very difficult position right now in terms of the film industry.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain's super-secret web network and uncovers the identity of all British agents operating in the secret intelligence sector, disappointing the agent on duty - a pity that Kevin Eldon, who plays the agent, has only a minor role.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is already in the throes of political disarray, showing pride and anger at everything. While Emma Thompson is doing well to play this Theresa May-like character, the truth is that they have nothing in the script to do much more.
The prime minister's intelligence advisers inform them that they need to bring in someone who has retired, as the personal information of all spies who are active in the intelligence field has been revealed.
The intended recipient, Johnny English, is a well-rounded and undisciplined, working as a school master at a wealthy institution, but the party teaches 'off-the-record' lessons on how to perform 'undercover' activities: Here are some good jokes, and the school of rock-type academy is good at spying on Johnny English.
English is brought back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunited with his long-time classmate, Bogg, whom Ben Miller played again.
Bug is now married, his wife is a sub-marine commander, and has destroyed Vicky Pepperdine in this 'Jolly-Hockey-Stick' character.
Batman and Robin are back in the Secret Service of Her Majesty, and 'Work' has begun, but things go awry as they encounter a much-desired beauty played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling into the trap of the influential tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: Jake Lacey plays the clueless billionaire Jason Volta.
English and Buff begin a procession of artificial cockroaches: they set fire to a French restaurant dressed as waiters; they smuggle themselves abroad in Volta's luxury boat; and John English confuses matters when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get to know the inside of Volta's house.
They definitely have all the talent for this part of the movie, but it's so gentle and hilarious, it's like watching Koch TV on the whole.
It's an average movie.
Even after watching other Johnny English movies, I still couldn’t stop thinking: Can’t the British film industry give a character to the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
The British Labour Party has rejected the idea of a four-day work week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a progressive plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week and receive a five-day wage.
According to reports, the party wants the company's capitalists to pass on the profits generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day's leave.
If this happens, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but will be able to buy the old wage themselves.
According to news sources, the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and the party is planning to tilt the country in favour of the workers.
As a means of benefiting workers from the changing economy, the idea of a four-day work week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress.
A senior Labour leader told the Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
<0xE2><0x80><0x98>It won’t happen overnight, but a four-working week is an aspiration that fits into the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and as a party’s overall industrial policy.’
The Labour Party is not the first party to recognise a four-day working week, which the Green Party had promised during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not accepted by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The idea of a week with four working days is not a party policy and does not consider it a party policy.'
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explain his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he plans to take back power from "non-faceted directors" and "profit-makers" of utility firms.
Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in the white companies may not get their full share back, as a Labour government may be able to levy 'deductions' based on the wrongful acts observed and understood.
He also confirmed that there are plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds for the transfer of 10 per cent of the shares of private sector firms to employees.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in "60 Minutes" to discuss whether the FBI's investigation will change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, has raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings would force any Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, Scott Pelli, author of "60 Minutes C," asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI's finding anything would lead them to change their decision.
Kennedy was more open-minded than a colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to trial, and I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, after that allegation came to light, I called him and asked, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Did you do this?’
He showed determination, determination, and unshakable will."
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be cemented to the stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, it's just an indictment shot," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Balsey Ford.
"No one has been able to confirm it.
It's a 36 year old story.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be hosted in New York this Saturday, and the annual concert will feature impressive performances by the stars, as well as a remarkable mission to do just that; eradicate poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people flocked to the Great Lawn in Central Park to attend the Global Citizen Festival not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the program's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group working with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To get a free ticket to participate in this event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), music concert lovers need to perform a number of tasks or "activities"; these activities include volunteering, emailing a world leader, phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But with only 12 years to go to achieve this goal, how far has the Global Citizen succeeded?
Is rewarding people with a free concert ticket a fundamental way to persuade people to respond in favor of a call to action, or is "clickivism" - a situation where people think they are making a real difference by signing an online complaint or sending a tweet - another form of so-called uselessness?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters, helping a platform of different goals.
It says the measures have helped persuade world leaders to announce pledges and policies worth more than $37 billion, aimed at driving mobility into the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has selected 390 pledges and declarations that have been derived from its activities, and have distributed or raised at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the money they raise has so far directly impacted 649 million people around the world.
After receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens, one of the key assurances was that they would be offered $35 million to help the country end the acute acute acute malnutrition in Rwanda. The promise was made by The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow in a way that takes advantage of their full potential."
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can bring a complete stop to the social injustice of malnutrition in history," Tracey Ulman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
After taking more than 5,000 steps, calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced it will fund a scheme called the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children as a nutritional supplement.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is "Why do you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights movement and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger when we are together.
This year, the event in New York will feature performances by Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janet Mony, with Deborah-Lee Furness and Huff-Jackman hosting the event.
U.S. Navy could be used as a "restriction" to disrupt Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Tsingke has revealed that Washington could seek the Navy's help "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy reaching markets, including the Middle East.
Singe alleged that Russia's intervention in Syria was a means of seeking new markets, and that Russia was acting on the invitation of Syria's legitimate government.
"I believe they are interfering in the Middle East because they want to be a powerhouse in the Middle East, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the South of Europe," he said.
According to this official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"With our navy, the United States has the capability to ensure that sea lanes remain open, and to block their energy if necessary and ensure that it does not reach the market," he said.
Singhke was addressing the participants at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that in practice they are one and the same.
While describing Russia as a "single-strategic horse" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, "The economic route over Iran and Russia is to almost always make the most out of fuel and replace one with another."
The Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, away from Russia.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Germany the "prison" of Berlin Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that there are economic reasons behind Washington's fierce opposition to the plan and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be seen as a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position was met with a backlash from Germany, with Germany once again reiterating its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading body, has asked the US to refrain from both EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big headache for me when a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will make a "decisive decision" about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would make a "decisive decision" about running for president following the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider running during a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and the government needs a woman on top," she said.
“After November 6th, I will take my running for president seriously.”
During the Town Hall session, Warren rated him as "a leader who is taking this country in the wrong direction", saying President Donald Trump was "going in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"We need an FBI investigation before the vote is cast," Warren tweeted on Friday.
However, according to a poll released on Thursday, a majority of people in Warren's own constituency are considering not running for president in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported such a move.
There was more support in the opinion poll for former governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy, while 48 percent opposed.
Other prominent Democratic leaders who are likely to contest the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will officially decide on his candidacy in January.
Sarah Palin's speech at Donald Trump's rally
After joining the army in September, Palin spent nearly a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"When I think of what my own son is going through and what he went through when he came back, I can understand the plight of the other families who are suffering from the trauma of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers bring when they return home," she said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Describing his son's arrest as "the elephant in the room," Palin said, "They're coming back a little different, they're coming back hard-hearted, they're thinking and wondering if they're getting any respect for what the accompanying soldiers, airmen and every member of the military has given the country," she said of her son and others who have retired from the military.
He was arrested on Monday from Wasilla, Alaska, where he is charged with domestic violence against a woman, who had a weapon with her when she was harassing him, and was under the influence of alcohol, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC to challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing lynchings or domestic violence.
Representatives from 10 states and the District of Columbia filed a "Friend-of-the-Court Brief" in Washington on Friday, opposing the new policy and supporting a person seeking asylum.
The full name of the complainant in the 'Grace vs. Sessions' lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said she had been raped by her partner and "sons who are members of criminal gangs," but her application for asylum was rejected by US officials on June 20.
They were arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where widespread criminal gang attacks and domestic violence take place, where a large number of applicants seeking asylum in the U.S. come from.
In 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals overturned a U.S. asylum policy that allowed undocumented immigrants who had escaped domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement issued on Friday, District Attorney General Carl Resin said the new law was a "disregard for state, federal and international law that has been in effect for decades."
"Federal law mandates that all claims to asylum must be settled on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, but such a ban violates that principle," claims the "front-of-the-court brief."
Lawyers then argued in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants hurts the U.S. economy, saying asylum seekers are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the "necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to people who have survived attacks from criminal gangs or domestic violence.
"Shelter is available to those who leave their home country because of fear of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 policy announcement.
Giving shelter was never intended to solve all the problems people around the world face every day, even the most serious ones.
The death toll in the state of Tamil Nadu has doubled, with rescue operations in full swing.
The situation was even worse for the survivors.
"The pressure that is felt is tremendous," said Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sickly boy in one of the bustling milk evacuees in the city.
"The ambulance is arriving every few minutes.
There's no clean water."
Residents could be seen returning to their damaged homes, picking up belongings soaked in water and trying to shift whatever they could find to safer ways.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake left hundreds of people injured and hospitals destroyed.
Some of the injured, including Dvi Haris, who suffered a fracture in his back and shoulder, took a rest outside Paul's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous strong tremors.
When the earthquake shook the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter, Dwy Harris' eyes were filled with tears.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
"I feel like I've been cramped for the remnants of the wall," Harris told The Associated Press, adding that she and her family were in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but no sound was heard thereafter.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they're somewhere safe.
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of using "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily about the bilateral benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread China's propaganda.
The US president made reference to the China Daily's supplement in the newspaper Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after he accused China of trying to meddle in the November 6 election to the US Congress.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election was a new step in the escalation of Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, the relationship between Beijing and Washington remains mired in a deepening trade war, with both sides repeatedly increasing tariffs on each other's goods.
In the trade war, China had already increased tariffs by giving a blow to the US, which economists in China and the US said was designed to target import firms in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a long-time resident of Iowa and owner of one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling down on the threat by publishing Propaganda in our own independent media," Bransted wrote in a comment column for the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By placing an ad paid for on the 'Des Moines Register,' the Chinese government is taking advantage of the freedom of expression and the freedom of the press that has been nurtured in the United States to spread Propaganda," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, here in Beijing, in the news stands on the streets, you can see the limited voices of dissent and not even a true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people may have of China's troubled economic path because the media has come under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also wrote that his article had "slipped one of China's leading newspapers from its promise to publish," but did not mention which newspaper it was.
As the Kavanaugh scandal continues, Republicans are likely to woo women voters before the midterm elections, say analysts.
With many leading Republican party leaders standing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh facing numerous sexual assault allegations and defending him, a political analyst has warned that during the upcoming midterm elections, the Republican Party will face a blow, especially from women.
The sentiment around this is so high that a majority of Republicans appear to already want to move forward with a vote.
There is no going back on these things," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse Universitys Maxwell School, wrote in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
The last-minute demand by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation was not enough to appease angry voters, Reehr said.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and November," Karin Jean Pierre, a senior adviser and national women's spokesperson for the progressive group Moowon, told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
Despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s affidavit, Mike reports that on Friday morning, protesters demonstrated in the Senate corridor and chanted “November is coming!” as the Judiciary Committee, which is controlled by Republicans, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democratic Party is going to be removed from the chart," Stu R<0xC3><0xB6>tenberg, who does political analysis without bias, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; that's true.
But there's still room for more, especially among women voters who lean back and forth in the suburbs and among young people aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president but don't vote as often."
Even before Ford's ad affidavit detailing allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that there would be a backlash if the Republican went ahead with the confirmation.
"It's messing up the GOP," Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether they'll be appointed to the Kavanaugh bench, it's about the way Republicans have handled this allegation and how Republicans have treated the victim," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, according to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to disagree on who to trust in the context of Ford's and Coventry's affidavits, and they give a little weight to Coventry's belief.
A new poll conducted by YouGov shows that 41 percent believe Ford's affidavit is true or probable, while 35 percent believe Kavanaugh is true or probable.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh had lied about his affidavit, with only 30 percent saying he had lied about Ford.
Following a request from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked him with alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that while attending a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals.
The founder of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, the project is built on Berners-Lee's own open-source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In a separate interview allotted to Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the purpose behind the intrusion was to "dominate the world."
"We have to start now," he said.
"This is a historic event."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It will contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is a technology similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in a single browser at the same time.
The peculiarity of the personal online data store is that it is entirely the user who decides which types of information can be accessed by which people.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea is to become a company that provides resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee and Bruce IBM, as well as some on-staff developers and a community of volunteer coders who are hired to work on the project.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inform website.
"""I and my team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they want to introduce a complete overhaul that will completely dethrone all of our business models overnight,"" Lee said."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post published in the media on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Intrapt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influence on net neutrality debate.
Although the input begins, Berners-Lee will continue as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: The priest who won the Victoria Cross for his participation in World War I is remembered
The Church of England priest, who won the Victoria Cross for being a fighter in World War I, is remembered 100 years later by his own compatriots.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Wan received the award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehoucourt.
However, four days later, he was assassinated by a sniper, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons unveiled the memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wan, said that the unveiling of the stone was a "bright symbolism" exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning work.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vane led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quent, "through heavy snow and bullets fired from the field and from mechanized guns."
He then jumped into the firing line, expressing "great defiance," and single-handedly jumped into a field-gun column, leading his battalion forward and dropping three of his enemy soldiers.
A month before the end of the war, Lieutenant Colonel Vane was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918.
"I know I haven't been able to live up to the example of my grandfather's heroic deeds, but that makes me humble," said 72-year-old Michael Vann.
After the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, he and his brother, Dr. James Vane, laid a wreath.
Michael Vaughan said he was extremely proud to play his part in the parade, adding that "the bravery of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give."
MMA fans who stayed awake all night to watch the bellator 206 had to be content with a peppy pig
Just imagine, what it would be like if you woke up all night to see a crowd-stricken Bellateur 206 and this important event was denied to you.
The bill from San Jose includes 13 fights, including six on the main card, which are shown live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were about to fight, viewers in the UK were shocked when Peppa switched coverage to the Pig.
Those who waited until the morning to wake up to enjoy the fight were disappointed.
A fan on Twitter wrote that the screen turned into a children's cartoon "a kind of dirty joke."
"With government regulation in place, broadcasting that content at 6 a.m. is inappropriate so they had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Shorts, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Oh, the pig, yeah.
The company's president, Scott Cocker, said it would try to work out a schedule that would include more UK audiences in the future.
"When I think of Replay, I think we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning, and we can't fix it until our time on Sunday and their time on Monday."
But we are trying to resolve it.
Trust me, when the coverage changed, a lot of text messages flew here and there, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it and at first we thought it was a technical glitch.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that it won't happen again.
"We've had six fights, five of which we'll shorten as we normally do, and I think we've given the audience more than they need."
This is an unfortunate situation."
Deseret Island Discs: Tom Daly says he felt 'embarrassed' over sex
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said she didn't realize until she went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
He spoke at the first Radio 4 Desert Island discus featuring Lauren Laverne, and spoke about gay rights that give "hope" to others.
He said he had lost interest in being a parent and winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the show's regular host for a long time, was on vacation for several months due to illness.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> said that he felt "less" than others when he was growing up because "the society did not approve of boys and girls being loved equally."
He said: "I feel inferior and different from others, the real things that have given me the strength and courage to succeed to this day.
He said he wanted to prove he was "something," so he wasn't disappointed when everyone finally found out about his sexuality.
A two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics, Dali has now become a big LGBT campaigner, using his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to legalize heterosexuality.
He said he opened up because he felt fortunate to be able to live in public without any adverse consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" by falling in love with a man, a US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
He further deposed that Dali married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him but the age difference was never an issue.
"When you are going through so much hardship at such a young age" - Dal<0xC3><0xAD> first competed at the Olympics when he was 14, and Dal<0xC3><0xAD>'s father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to meet someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs to his own.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, with whom Daly said his "whole view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have been talking about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than Olympic gold medals.
It's an Olympic gold medal."
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> has a son named after his late father, Robert, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011, at the age of 40.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> said his father never accepted that he was going to die and the last thing he asked was whether tickets for London 2012 were still available because he wanted to be in the front row.
"But I couldn't say, 'Daddy won't be here until we see him in the front row,'" he said.
"I held his hand until he took his last breath and it was only when the breath actually stopped and he died that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Dal<0xC3><0xAD> competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
"I knew all my life that it was what I had dreamed of - to swim in front of a crowd of a motherland at an Olympic Games, and there couldn't be a better feeling," he said.
This was also the inspiration for his first song <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Heather Smeen’s Proud <0xE2><0x80><0x93> to be chosen, and the song resonated with him until the Olympics, and he would still be thrilled when he heard this song.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Michael Jackson wasn't in the best shape of his life on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will make history when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll have to fend for his form to keep it from becoming an unpleasant milestone.
In the two-year-old event, Mickelson, who is playing for the 12th time, was dismissed by captain Jim Furyk at Foreballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
As was often the case for America, he was a five-time major winner, encouraged by others and trained in the range in the hope of solving problems that plagued him.
The 48-year-old, who was at the peak of his playing career and lacked the accuracy of the ball, is not fit for the toughest Le Golf National course. The ground is full of grass and will punish the wrong shots.
Although this golf course is no longer so difficult, Mickelson will face ninth-seeded British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's match. He has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
Mickelson's game is definitely going to be decisive if the Americans below four points get off to a strong start playing 12 singles matches.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, saying he can't say anything else.
"He's fully aware of the role he's going to have to play today, and he told me he'll be ready tomorrow when he's ready to take me out," Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in him.
He's a great player and has contributed a lot to the team this season.
"I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined it more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It would mark the end of a rider's Cup career that has virtually disappeared along with the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but his presence has brought a lot to the team that can't be erased, Furyk said.
"He's fun, he's intense, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great person to have on the team," Furyk explained.
I think it was a lot of fun for the young players to play against him this week, and it was fun to watch.
He gives more than just a game.
I'm sure Captain America will soon be gone.
European captain Thomas John is well aware from experience that a flawless lead that advances to the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup will then crumble.
Dane made his debut in a match at Valderama in 1997, where the team under the captaincy of Sev Ballesteros scored five points more than the Americans but came to the finish line with a very slight margin, winning the match 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You're reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, we won at Valderrama, but it was just a win," John said, referring to the class of 2018 when John's team won 5-3 at Le Golf International on Sunday and 10-6 yesterday.
So, history has shown me and the rest of the team that it's not over yet.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Get out of this situation and do the right thing.
Nothing is over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's what we're trying to achieve with this trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in my team, but on the other hand we know who is better - they are the best players in the world."
John, happy with his team's performance on the rough golf course, added: "I can never be ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a different animal.
It's a personal choice to do something different tomorrow.
It's great to be on the course with a partner when things are better, but if you're on the course alone, your ability as a golfer will be fully tested.
That's the message you have to give to the players, that is, to bring out the best in you tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to go and get the best out of him."
Unlike Jon, whose opposite is Jim Furyk, who asks players to perform in person rather than as partners, the only exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Furyk has seen both ends of this huge sporting event, which takes place on the last day of the tour, when Furyk was part of the team that won in Brooklyn, and when Europe pulled out the "Miracle in Medina."
For the final day, when asked how 1999's captain Ben Crenshaw lined up his players, he said, "I remember every bit of it."
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but as seen on the Brookline, you want to have a fast start as seen in Medina.
When speed goes the other way, there is a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We've set up the line-up accordingly, we've styled the players in a way that feels right for us, and you know, we're trying to sort out a magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been handed the task of leading the comeback, and in the top-match he will face Rory McIlroy, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I went with this group on this order because I think it covers it all the way,” John said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship commissioning postponed again
The latest warship of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 as a replacement for older and cold war-era warships, but due to faulty systems and snowballing costs, it will not be commissioned until at least next year, according to local media reports.
A military spokesman said the commissioning of "Reinland-Fals," the flagship ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class of warships, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The Navy was supposed to get the ship in 2014 itself, but the fate of the prestigious project was adversely affected by the issues faced before delivery.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships to replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
The ships will be equipped with high-powered artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some covert technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature is that there is no need to carry out maintenance for a long time, so it is necessary to be able to deploy new warships, up to two years, away from the ports of the mother country.
However, the continuous delay in commissioning means that these warships with advanced technologies are likely to have expired by the time they enter service; these ships are said to have allowed Germany to demonstrate its strength in foreign countries.
The ill-fated F-125s gained media attention last year when the German Navy formally refused to commission the ships and sent them back to the Hamburgerhele Blom and Vossship Yard.
It was the first time in the history of the Navy that the ship was returned to the manufacturer after taking delivery.
No one knows the reasons for the ship's return, but German media reports that the ship has several critical "software and hardware malfunctions" and therefore would not benefit from a warship being deployed on a war mission.
Software inadequacies are particularly important as the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates are controlled by a team of 120 men, just half of the sailors on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, there have been reports that the ship is overloaded, the performance of the ship is significantly reduced, and the Navy's ability to innovate in the future is limited.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Fals" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the German car during World War II.
Even if the hardware issues with the error are kept aside, the cost of the entire project - including training of the crew - becomes an issue.
It was initially expected to cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion, but is now said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion.
In light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining, issues affecting the latest warships are of particular importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was in fact "eroding deployable ships."
Officials said the problem is compounded by the fact that old ships are being decommissioned and new ships are not being procured.
He expressed regret that none of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates had benefited the Navy.
The Secret Life of the National Trust
A new research is underway in an estate in the hilly region of Scotland, aimed at understanding how bats are used in the hunt for food.
The findings are expected to be useful in gaining new knowledge about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and helping to guide future bat conservation activities.
At Inverveve Gardens in Wester Ross, scientists at the National Trust for Scottland will observe normal bats, soprano pipistrelles bats, and brown-eared doubenton bats.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the estate to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will conduct a mobile survey using hand-held detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings can help in determining the frequency of bat sounds and knowing which bat species make the sound.
Subsequently, an ecosystem map and report will be prepared to create a panoramic view of the behaviour of the bats.
Rob Dever, a nature conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results of the survey will reveal which areas of the ecosystem are most important for bats and how each of the bat species is used.
For bats and other related species, this information can help determine the benefits of ecosystem maintenance activities, such as the creation of grasslands and the best care of woodlands.
Over the past century, the number of bats across Scotland and the UK has declined significantly.
Bats are at risk from habitat destruction, development activities and buildings affecting their habitats.
Wind-driven turbines, electric lighting, flypapers, chemical treatment of construction materials and attacks from pets are threats to bats.
The shadows aren't really dark.
However, due to their hunting habit at night, their ears are more useful than eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technology to accurately determine the path of insects and obstructions in the flying path.
The NTS bats are in charge of the maintenance of over 270 historically important buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
The institute has ten trained specialists, who conduct surveys on a regular basis, conduct nesting tests, and sometimes even rescue animals.
The organisation has opened Scotland's first dedicated bat sanctuary in Trievea Estate in Dumfries, housing eight of the bat species found in Scotland in this sanctuary, called Galloway.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says that this estate is ideal for bats.
"There's a lot of interest in triathlons here," he said.
"There are a lot of old buildings, a lot of big trees and a good ecosystem.
But there's still a lot of unknowns about bats, so the work we're doing here and in other estates will help us understand more about what it takes for bats to be prosperous."
He stresses the importance of checking bats before making repairs inside buildings, as the accidental destruction of a motherlode can kill 400 female bats and children, and sometimes the entire bats in the area can be exterminated.
It is illegal to kill or injure them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, has appealed to the public for help.
They said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t even know how many bat species there are and how well their numbers are increasing.”
Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers are seeking compensation for the publication of a rape story published in a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations against him "fake news" and said people were using his name to "make a name for themselves."
His lawyers are preparing to move court against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Ronaldo is accused of raping Katrin Mayorga, an American woman, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 when she played for Portugal and Juventus.
It is alleged that Ronaldo paid the woman $375,000 to not disclose the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Within hours of the allegations being reported and Instagram talking to its 142 million followers in a live video, the 33-year-old Ronaldo slammed the reports as "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
"It's been a long time coming," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in a live stream.
They want to use my name.
This is natural.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm fine," he added with a shrug.
With regard to the allegations, Ronaldo's lawyers said they were preparing to file a defamation case against Der Spiegel, which they described as "an impermissible reporting on suspicions in the realm of privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Shorts, the actor’s lawyer, said the actor would seek compensation for “moral damages as serious as a violation of the law,” adding that “in recent times, this is one of the most serious violations of individual rights.”
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suit at the Palms Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room after a meeting at the nightclub, where they allegedly tortured him.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo knelt in front of her and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good man" but that he had cheated on "one percent."
Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but documents say it was consensual.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and took photos of the injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court, saying she agreed to the settlement because she felt the "reactions would be intimidating" and because she was worried about being "publicly humiliated."
Thirty-four of the plaintiffs said they were still in the process of filing for bankruptcy.
Ronaldo was preparing to leave Manchester United and join Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, when he moved to Juventus for a whopping $100 million this summer.
Brexit: 'I'm sorry for the loss' of British automakers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its status as the world's number one car maker.
He added that he was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that if Bexit goes ahead without a deal, it will lose jobs due to the impact of delays at the country's borders.
The Burnston plant, manufactured by Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I think we will have to stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Burnston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns over how cross-border trade will operate, with the UK leaving the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says it will shut down the mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the main concerns that carmakers say are related to supply chain risks.
Toyota's manufacturing line is based on "time components arrive," with components arriving from suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
On 29 March, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there could be a barrier at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of components, the industry said.
The company said it was "impossible" to store more inventory than it has in Toyota's Derbyshire plant for a day, so it would have to stop production.
Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border," Clarke said.
“We need an understanding. Not only do we want to enjoy the current success, we want to have a better understanding that allows us to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers reminds us that what we have had is a highly successful supply chain and we definitely need to be able to keep it that way."
While Toyota did not say how long it would halt production, the company warned that in the long run, the extra cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and result in the loss of jobs.
Peter Suvallaris, unit union convener at the plant, who has been working at Burnston for 24 years, said his members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience once these jobs go, there will be no coming back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a definite and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein delayed again: White House
The White House said Sunday that Donald Trump’s crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “will be delayed by a week” as the feud over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election meddling, the relationship between Trump aides and Russia, and the obstruction of the president's involvement in the justice system.
For months, Washington has been fueling rumors about whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby undermining Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Despite the news that he was going to retire, he went to the White House last Monday.
Trump is scheduled to meet at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he was "not interested" in dismissing Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that would have required Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, and once again delayed the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set and it's likely to be this week, I think we can postpone it by a week, taking into account everything else that's going on in the Supreme Court.
I'm always looking for new information."
Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
Chris Wallace is the reason for it.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to resentment towards the "mass" of TV reporters, although she stated: "I do not disagree with the fact that they are reaching out collectively."
He added that there will be direct contact between Trump and the media.
"The president has conducted more Q&A sessions than any of his predecessors," she said, adding without evidence: "We've looked at their numbers."
"There will still be press conferences," Sanders said, "and if the media gets a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me."
We've done it many times over the last few weeks, and I'm sure you've seen us do it many times.
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters during his White House visits or during open sessions, either on a regular basis or during press conferences with distinguished people.
It is very rare to find newspapers.
This week in New York, we're going to show why it's done so well.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland on fears of Brexit
The letter was written to EU workers working in the NHS in Scotland to thank the country and express their desire to remain there after Brexit.
Just six months before Britain's departure from the European Union, Schoen Freeman sent a letter to the MSP.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to pay the cost of the status of permanent residence applications for EU citizens working in the field of transferable public services.
In the letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "As of late summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on a compromise on the withdrawal have continued, and expected decisions may be made this autumn.
However, the UK has already begun to prepare for the inevitable.
I know this is a time of uncertainty.
That is why I would like to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution made by every member of the staff, whatever be their citizenship.
The invaluable experience and skills demonstrated by colleagues from many parts of the European Union and elsewhere have played a major role in strengthening and improving the functioning of health care services, thereby benefiting patients and society at large.
“Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay here.”
Christiane Abercrombie has undergone an emergency brain surgery.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who underwent emergency surgery for a head injury following his defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31<0xE2><0x80><0x93>27, reported Tennessee’s Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He's been down the line," Reid said.
On the side-line itself, the trainers and medics administered oxygen to Abercrombie and put him on a stretcher and then took him for further tests.
An official in the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery from the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"Details of the extent and type of the injury are not available," he said, adding that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the accident occurred.
It was the first season in the state of Tennessee since Abercrombie, a red-shirted second-year student, moved from Illinois.
By the end of Saturday's game, he had a total of five tackles, including 18 this season.
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they come to the UK.
When buying a property in the UK, foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the Tory plans.
The move will neutralise Corbyn's move to attract young voters.
Stamp duty will be levied on non-residents in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help the homeless
When foreigners buy property in the UK, they will have to pay a higher stamp duty - and Theresa May will be able to use the extra money to help the homeless.
The move is an attempt to block Jeremy Corbyn's bid to attract younger voters by offering more affordable housing and targeting higher-income groups.
In the UK, stamp duty will be levied on individuals and entities who do not pay taxes. The additional money will support the government's move to provide housing for the homeless.
Surcharge - in addition to the current stamp duty, which was levied on second homes and rental homes two years ago - could be as high as three per cent.
The fund aims to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year.
13 per cent of the newly built London properties are bought by people outside the UK, making it difficult for first-time buyers to get into the housing market.
Many of the country's richest regions - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because a good percentage of buyers are foreigners who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction firms of holding the land but not using it, and called on Mrs May to drop her quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's "apartheid" problem.
Mr. Corbin announced an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent restrictions and an end to evictions of "non-smokers."
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "I said last year that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, to make life better for every new generation.
This means that we need to fix our broken home market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that those who do not live in Britain and foreign companies can buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
The dream of many people having their own home is so remote that the humiliation of not having a shelter where one can sleep well remains quite a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate wish is to have control of Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to control Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old is currently third in League One with a challenge to revive the North-East club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a player, I want to play for my country.
I got a B cap, that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's something that's always held me back.
But only if I get the chance to do so."
Rose's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poit and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alova Athletic boss says he has no hesitation in succeeding the established names of such big clubs. He had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The question for me right now is, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’ Success will be measured.
The structure and facilities of this club undoubtedly put it in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but if I can get back to the club, I'm sure I'll be successful."
Ross spent only three years of his management career as assistant boss in Dumbarton and 15 months on Hart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alva to recover from a defeat to move into the third tier, and saved St Mirren from a defeat to become the champion title winner of the following season.
Rose said she feels happier than ever in her sports career at Clyde, Heart Lipule, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academies.
"That may have been the real turning point," he says, taking Loyola's role.
"I've always believed that management is better than playing.
Strangely enough, but I've earned the right to live, to reach certain heights.
But it can be hard to play.
There is a lot going on every week.
I still have work-related difficulties and dedications, but I feel very good about the management.
I’ve always wanted to go into management, and now I’m happy that I’m doing what I love at my best age.”

Restaurant chains are under increasing pressure as the heat of the summer has fueled the loss of pubs in the UK.
Figures indicate that sales in July were up 2.7 percent in pub bar groups, while in restaurants it was down 4.8 percent.
The figures were compiled by Peter Martin, CGA, a business consultancy, who said: “The continued summer and the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup was a pattern in June and July in pubs. Restaurants suffered a setback if they rose as much as 2.8%.
The restaurant sector saw a 1.8% decline in June.
Restaurants and bars have been downsizing while bars and pubs have been downsizing over the years.
Food led pubs also suffered in the summer heat, but this was not as much as restaurants.
Everyone wants to go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages in bars and pubs across the country increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food prices fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman of Leisure and Hospitality Analysts RSM says: "These results, seen in late April, are still ongoing.
The main factors that influence sales in markets are weather and social sporting events.
It's no exaggeration to say that restaurant groups have nothing to worry about when it comes to this, however, the 4.8 percent year-over-year sales drop is in addition to the continued focus on price.
Food-led operators will have to wait and see if the relatively mild weather in August can provide temporary relief."
The overall growth of 2.7 per cent in July, with new openings in the pub and restaurant sectors, actually indicates a slowdown in brand roles.
The Koffer Peach Tracker, a UK-based sales observer for pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and reviews operational data of 47 activity groups with a turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is a benchmark in the field.

A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in “fake Instagram” accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "main" account and confidential personal accounts to show to their parents.
A mother who went to see the secret site of her 13-year-old teenage daughter was stunned to see a teenage girl in it urging others to "rape her."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Head Masters and Head Mistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had 2 profiles, and half had secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Bucknan said: “It’s an unpleasant fact that teenagers are trying to build online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eliud Kipchoge "will be the voice for athletics" on the Scottish Athletics Board
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland’s most famous track and field athlete. Chairman Ian Beatty said it’s a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from the vast experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Elied has great respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we believe that bringing them on board will greatly benefit Scotland's athletics," Beatty added.
Doyle said: "I'm very excited to be working as a voice for the athletes and believe I can make my own contributions to and help guide Scotland's sport."
At the 1996 Atlanta Games, an American and now a permanent BBC pundit who won four Olympic gold medals, including 200m and 400m races, lost his mobility due to a transient ish-keem attack.

I couldnt walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell how long it will last.
It was a very difficult time, but all is well. I have learned to walk again, and now I am able to exercise with enthusiasm!
Thank you for the messages!”
Mother-in-law's use of cow's milk has sparked controversy online
An ad for breast-feeding cows has generated a lot of comments online.
In an announcement entitled "The World's First Wearable Noiseless Breast Pump," Consumer Tech Company LV released an interesting music video showcasing the new pump's facility for mothers.
It features 4 ammars dancing to this music in a place where straw is kept for cows. The lyrics say: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see the tail." And "If you don't listen, I'll tell you, these aren't farts, they're my breasts."
He said, "I'm going to give it to the kids, I'm going to give it to the girls, I'm going to give it to the boys, I'm going to give it to the girls."
However, the company's Facebook page has been flooded with comments.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been receiving mixed reactions from fans, with many commenting on the dairy industry’s “incidences”.
“It was a very bad decision to use animals to advertise this product.
"They, like us, produce milk by conceiving and giving birth, but unless their babies are taken away from them within days of birth," one person wrote.
The LV breast pump (LV/'mother') can be very well placed inside a nursing bra
He added: "It's hard for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can breastfeed their babies?”
Another added: “Unforgivable ad.”
Some people have commented that the song is "interesting."
"I think this is a good idea.
If I had a shower, I would do it.
When I was a kid, I felt like an animal.
This post is a bit long, but I'll take it as it is.
"It's a good product," he said.
Another commented: "It's an interesting ad targeting mothers (sometimes at work and in toilets) who feel like "pumping, cows"."
This is not a criticism of the industry."
At the end of the video, the women are seen dancing around the fire.
The idea behind this campaign is to make women who pump breastmilk feel like cows.
However the LV pump is definitely convenient, there are no wires or tubes. And the nursing bra is properly fixed inside, which gives women the freedom to walk, pick up children and go outside while pumping.
Anna Balarin, partner of Mother and ECD, says: "The LV pump is definitely a revolutionary product, and it takes courage to start.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and cows, we tried to bring to light breast pumping and the inconveniences associated with it. The new pump provides the freedom to do so in a very interesting and relatable way.
This isn't the first time that LVMH has been in the news.

Hundreds of migrant children shifted to tent camps on Texas border
While the number of children crossing the border each month remains unchanged, there has been a sharp rise in the number of children who are prohibited from crossing the border because of some tough policies of the Trump administration that make it difficult for children to be taken over by sponsors.
Many traditional sponsors are undocumented immigrants and put themselves at risk if they decide to take on the responsibility of a child.
In June, the U.S. government announced a policy that requires federal authorities, sponsors, and adult members of their households to submit their fingerprints and share that information with the immigration authority.
Matthew Albans, a top official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress last week that more than a dozen people had been arrested in the past week for sponsoring unaccompanied minors.
The agency said that 70 per cent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80 per cent of sponsors and their families are illegal immigrants, with a large proportion of them having a criminal background.
"We're trying to protect them," Mr. Allen said.
In order to settle the case quickly, the authorities had implemented new rules that required them to appear in court within a month of their detention.
More and more people are making conference calls instead of appearing in person before the immigration judge for their legal representation.
Those who do not comply will be removed from the country immediately.
Depending on the situation over the next few months, like the comments and reports from Shelter activists, children who spend more time in detention become anxious and depressed. This can lead to poor postures and attempts to escape.
It is important to note that these concerns are more likely to be ignored by children who are at risk of being neglected in large facilities, such as Tonelo, according to the Advocates.
She said it's important for families to be able to say goodbye to their loved ones, even if they don't have the time to say goodbye to their loved ones.
US, French, and Turkish forces to withdraw from Syria
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Interior Minister Walid al-Moulam called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes at a time when the country's war is entering its eighth year.
The deputy prime minister, who is also in charge of counter-terrorism, said foreign forces were present on Syrian soil illegally and would "deal with them as required."
"They should be removed without delay," he said.
Moulem stressed that the "war on terror" in Syria, which has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions from their homes since 2011, is almost over.
He said Damascus would continue its "sacred struggle" until "illegal aliens and terrorist groups" were wiped out from all Syrian territory.
About 2,000 U.S. troops are in Syria, training and advising Syrian Arabs and Kurdish militias who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moullam said it was time for them to return.
"We call on the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"It's a human rights issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid to Syria will not be provided as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the construction of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, provided an opportunity to move forward with political negotiations, according to UN diplomats.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region of three million people.
Moulem stressed that the agreement had a definite "time limit" and hoped that the military attack would target fighters from the Nusra Front, including jihadists linked to al-Qaeda, "and wipe them out."
UN envoy Stephan De Mistura said he hoped to convene the first meeting of a new committee comprising members from the ruling and opposition parties to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and conduct elections.
Moulam had put forward the Government's role in the Committee and said that the panel's only function was to "review the existing constitutional provisions."

Cash is pouring in from outside for tough mid-term elections.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District has been overrun by the redistribution of congressional districts where two officials competed for the same post.
Conor Lamb, a Pittsburgh Democrat whose borders were recently redrawn, won a seat in a special election in another district last summer.
Lampe competes with another official, Republican Rep. Keith Rothfuss, who now represents the 12th district in erstwhile Pennsylvania.
In January, the Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally misrepresented to the advantage of the Republican Party.
The 17th edition of the contest opened an economic stalemate between the major financial parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lampe became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after winning a small majority in a special election in March, which was widely viewed as the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been held by the Republican Party for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
Democrats have a small chance of winning.
The U.S. is considering imposing a fine on China for its support of El Salvador, which it later withdrew from.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had backed Beijing without causing significant discontent in Washington.
In June 2017, Trump also had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Trump had a hotel in Panama, but its partners fired the management team of Trump's firm.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions that they will no longer recognize Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
The penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received more than $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial assistance.
Penalties, including cutbacks in economic benefits and visa restrictions, are expected to hurt Central American countries and increase unemployment and murder rates.
As domestic meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials again postponed a high-level meeting to take stock of the progress of high-level talks on security and economic prosperity, similar to last year.
High-level officials are calling for the conference to go ahead by mid-September, which will also help consider fines on El Salvador.
Deputy Prime Minister Mike Pence, who was tasked with convening the meeting, postponed it to mid-October to include senior officials in the administration, according to policy analysts.

For this, an external analyst, who is very close to the administration, confirmed their claims and spoke about the uncertainties.
Studying history
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, which is likely to be special evidence in public documents about Trump's unfairness, is the next major event.
Mueller is investigating whether Trump's campaign co-operated with Russia in the run-up to our election.
Is it possible that Trump and a jury of his peers will not take responsibility for the outcome of that meeting, as if they were ready to go before the electorate again?
If Trump and the other members of the House of Representatives are willing to take on the responsibility, then the Senate will be able to do it again.
It is in the interests of all of us on both sides of the Atlantic to determine how long our efforts will last.

What would happen if we were to dismiss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenthal, who would determine the course of Mueller's investigation?
Last year, Rosenthal found it difficult to keep an eye on the president and consider him unfit for office.

With a win over the Austrians earlier this month and an impressive match against Villarreal in Spain putting them in the strongest position to qualify for the Group G of the Europa League, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
With Villarreal's 2-2 season over, midfielder Graham Torrens was unable to make his debut due to a knee injury, but he believes the Rangers will be able to do wonders on the springboard with the result.
"It's beneficial for us that Villarreal is in good condition," said the 31-year-old.

Women lose sleep over their fear of retirement savings.
Although many of the participants had clear views on how they should be protected, very few people had to talk to their family members about it.
The study found that nearly half of all people in the country talk to their partner about their long-term care needs.
Only 10 percent of people talk about it.
Everyone needs a family member to take care of them, but not many are willing to talk about it, said Holly Cinder, vice president of international life insurance business.
This is where we must begin.
If you don't talk to your partner and children about your wishes beforehand, you may not be able to enable your family to provide the kind of protection you want.
Discuss with your advisor and your family and make sure you know where and how much protection you are taking. How much these decisions will cost is an important factor.
Bring your financial advisor to the scene: Your advisor can help you with advice on how to handle these expenses.
This can be done through a policy that ensures traditional long-term protection in your interests to raise money, or a hybrid cash value life insurance policy that covers such costs, or a self-insurance with your own savings - as long as you have the money.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said.
Rescue officials said communication lines were cut in Dongla Regency in northern Palu, which was located very close to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, but they did not receive any information.
More than 16,000 people were displaced as a result of the earthquake.
Here are a few facts about the provinces of Palu and Donggala in the Republic of Ireland of Sulawesi.
Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, is a very narrow strait on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Tonggala Regency is located 300 km (180 mi) off the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
The regency is an administrative region below a province, with a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Tongalla, is dominated by fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is concentrated on Morowali, the opposite shore of the greater Silvis.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Tongalla have experienced several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western province of Tongalla, killing nine people.
Geographically located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is frequently prone to earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently.
2004: A massive December 26 earthquake in Indonesia's Aik Province, North Sumatra, affected 14 countries along the Indian coast and killed 226000 people, more than half of them in Aik itself.
2005: 2005 A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coasts of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake on Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggered a tsunami that devastated the entire southern coast, killing more than 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Patang, the capital of the province of North Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Sumatra in 2010 caused tsunami waves as high as 10 metres, destroying dozens of villages and killing more than 300 people.
The 2016 earthquake in PD Regency in the province of Aik caused significant damage and was followed by a devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it wasn't because of the tsunami, but because of me, more than 100 people were killed inside the collapsed buildings.
The 2018 earthquake on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok killed more than 500 people, most of them from the northern part of the island.
The earthquake caused thousands of buildings to collapse and thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trac Pal, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president-elect Sarah Palin, has been charged with domestic violence.
The Alaska State Troopers said in a report on Saturday that the 29-year-old, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he had also snatched the phone from the hands of the woman who was trying to inform the police about the alleged offences.
According to KTUU's report, the milk seized on a $500 unsecured bond has been remanded from the other-supreme paediatric facility.
When he appeared in court on Saturday and asked for an apology, he said he was "absolutely not guilty."
Pal faces three Class A misdemeanor charges, including a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B felony, which resulted in a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been brought against the company.
He was arrested in December 2017 for assaulting his father, Todd Paul.
The incident was reported to the police by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is pending in the Alaska Court of Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a report of a domestic violence offence, and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend also complained that he had been hit in the face.
In 2016, the Veterans Group had criticised Sarah Palin for her son's misdemeanor actions that led to his service being suspended on a PSTD.
Indonesia earthquake: Death toll mounts to 100
On Friday, 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The death toll is likely to rise in the coming days due to non-functioning of electricity and communication networks.
The earthquake was felt in central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the incident have gone viral on social media.
As the tsunami approached the coast, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for the city's beach festival.
Federal prosecutors have called for the death penalty for the NYC terrorist.
New York City prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for federal crimes that have not been carried out in the state since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Zypov was involved in an attack on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan using a home depot rental truck, killing pedestrians and cyclists on the way.
According to the Southern District of New York's death penalty notice, prosecutors need to prove that Zypov "deliberately" killed all eight people and "knowingly" caused serious bodily injuries.
Both charges are punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Cipow on 22 counts of conspiracy to commit eight murders, used by federal prosecutors for organized crime, and charged with assault and vandalism of a motor vehicle.
The lawyers said the manner in which the crime was committed was "brutal, barbaric and despicable" and that "substantial planning and planning" was required to carry out such an attack.

It's been more than a decade since the Southern District of New York issued a death sentence.
Khalid Barnes was convicted for the murder of two drug suppliers, but it was commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were last executed in a New York federal case for conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Zaypov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express any remorse even days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he was satisfied with his work.
Zaypov told authorities that the attack was inspired by ISIS videos he had seen on his phone.
He was also asked to raise the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
Federal defense attorney David Patten, who appeared on behalf of Saipo, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to award the death penalty without awarding life imprisonment without any possibility of release is likely to add to the psychological trauma of all those involved in the case," he said.
Cypo's defense has already urged lawyers not to seek the death penalty.
The Tory MP said Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has vowed to "get the People's Army on the line" at a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Yukip leader said politicians should "know the heat" from Eurocentrics - one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be put in charge of negotiations with Europe.
In March, Peter Bone, the real-life back-bencher, said in Birmingham that if he had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have already left.
The Tories underscore the challenges May faces in harmonizing her divided ranks by joining a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister has been struggling to protect his chalkers' compromise plan from attacks by Brexiters, reformers and the European Union.
The allies argued that they would proceed to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of the direct setbacks and would force Eurocentrics and Labour to choose between their promise and the 'miseries'.
Bourne said he wanted to "put out the crackers" at a "Leave Fishes Leave" rally in Solihull.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made an equal partner and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If it had been up to us, we would have left," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, 'I support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the cheaters'
Speaking to the BBC, he said: "We are not against the war.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bourne rejected claims that public opinion changed after the 2016 poll. the British people's mind has changed and the claim that they want to continue is completely untrue.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march, and she told reporters: I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to what the people are saying.
Chequers are not very well known in the public, and the opposition is not going to vote for them.
Please keep an eye out for spoilers.
In a message to Miss May, she said: "The prime minister can only keep his position until he keeps his promises.
Farage said that if you want to avoid the decision taken in the 2016 plebiscite, you should urge the politicians at the rally to "feel the heat."
"This is an issue of trust between us - the people and our ruling class," he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit, but we're here today to tell them - we're not going to let you do that."
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: I want you to 'feel the heat' of our political class on the verge of betraying Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the People's Army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and will never rest until we become an independent, autonomous, United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the protesters marched to Birmingham before staging a two-hour rally in the city centre.

Warren plans to carefully watch the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully analyze her candidacy for president after the November elections.
The Massachusetts Democrat told reporters at a town hall in western Mossackieux on Saturday about his future, the Boston Globe reported.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, is running against GOP state representative Geoff DeHail in November's re-election. In DeHail, she was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There is a lot of speculation about whether Trump will be in office in 2020.
The 36th meeting of the Town Hall format was held in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon
One of the participants asked if they were running for president.
"Warren replied, ""It's time for women to go to Washington to fix their broken state, and there will be a woman on top of that."
He was convicted of the murder of LSU's Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, aged 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference
They were asked to help identify the man in the video, which they released on Friday night.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the University of Southern California campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a bullet wound to the head, which resulted in his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters via 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wade went to his friend's defense and Simpson was shot.
Simpson, who was holding the weapon in his hand, was questioned and he admitted that he was present on the spot and Wade Simpson had been shot.
Simpson was arrested and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department without significant problems.
Growing up in Baton Rouge, the 6-foot-6-inch junior Sims played 32 games last season, including 10 starters, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2,9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ended the World Cup after the team handed an order to beat Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear from that moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in a match in which Mercedes’ team orders play a big role.
Boates had a good start to the pole, and defending his place in the first two turns, Hamilton was in a bad position when he was invited to attack fellow team members.
It was crucial for him to first go to the Pitts at home and allow Hamilton to run in traffic.
Mercedes followed behind the house with a lap, but Hamilton moved forward after the wheel-to-wheel action, cutting off the Ferrari driver, who, after the double three, was reluctant to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his twenty-first birthday.
After a quick finish, he held on to the tyres and took a big chunk of the race to fourth place, trailing Kimi Raikkonen.
He last reached the Pitts on the 44th lap, and after eight laps, could not accelerate, reaching the Rykon 4th.
"It was a difficult day because Waltery did very well and was a gentleman who told me to let go.
"The team did a great job," Hamilton said.
It was definitely body language.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein's argument that the Supreme Court had not tapped Christie Blaise Ford's letter alleging that she was sexually assaulted by Nominee Brett Kabanock.
While the Senate Judiciary Committee did not comment directly on Ford's letter to the president at a rally in West Virginia, he said what was happening in the Senate was "showing people how selfish, unfaithful and bad mannered they are."
"The beautiful things that are happening right now in the Senate are more likely to happen when you see angry people, when you see selfish, angry, bad-tempered and disloyal," he said.
If the news somehow bleeds, they'll say, "Oh, I didn't do that."
I did not do it."
Remember?
Ding Dong, are you ready?
Remember their answer <0xE2><0x80><0x93> you leaked the document <0xE2><0x80><0x93> “Oh, oh what?”
Oh, no.
I didn't steal it."
Oh, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator's face.
In July, Feinstein sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh that he had been bleeding in the first days of September - but he denied that it had been leaked from his office.
"I didn't try to hide Dr. Ford's allegations, and I didn't tell their story," Feinstein told a committee, reported The Heal
They asked me to keep it a secret, so I did.
But their protest didn't make the president feel comfortable, and he said at a rally on Saturday night that it was bad body language.
Maybe they didn't do it, but they displayed a body language that was as if they had never seen it."
The president said Democrats may be making accusations on their side even as they defend the nominee of the Supreme Court who has been accused of sexual assault by three women.
"They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
"You can see their selfishness and bad character, it doesn't matter who they hurt or who they run after to get the powers and the control," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Doerr scored 2 goals against Dundee for the Giants.
Dundee Stars bounced back from Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Stains, winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants have already taken a two-goal lead through the strikes of Patrick Doerr and Francis Belauer.
Mike Sullivan and John Crowne brought the home side to prominence even before the Giants' lead was restored.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bucharest scored for Tennyson before Lukas Lendewold scored the winning goal.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Kiffin's men from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides.
The openers came in at 3.35 in the fourth minute with the help of Kendall McFall and with four minutes to go, David Rutherford doubled the lead with the help of Belvedere.
After a busy opening time, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game 13-10 before Matt MacArthur's equaliser was delivered at 15:16.
At the end of the first half, the Giants took the lead before taking the first break by scoring their second goal of the night.
The home-side group was regrouped, and Bouchard included them in the level teams once more with a 27-37 powerplay goal.
Crowne and Charles Corcoran assisted Neilson for the first time in the match to give Dundee the lead at the end of the second period and ensured his team's victory in the fifth half of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five matches, arrived in Milton Keynes on Friday for their next match.

He remained in the office to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, flew safely.
Then he realized that the roof was leaking and he was going to blow it up.
He later died at the hospital.
His decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirit said, according to Australias ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to another city's big hospital.
But we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is very good news," he added.
According to the country's Disaster Mitigation Agency, the death toll in Donggala, CG and Bautung is likely to be in the thousands
The agency's spokesman, Suetopo Parvo Nagrao, said it believed the death toll could rise as many could not be reached, and many bodies were still under the rubble.

Air New Guinea plane crash: One person still missing after Lagoon crash
The airline, which was flying the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing and that a crew of 47 had already been evacuated from the plane.
In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Air New Guinea said it had not been able to find a male passenger.
The airline said it had contacted local authorities, hospitals, investigators and was searching for the missing man.
The airline did not respond to requests for more information such as the age of the missing person and citizenship.
While trying to land at the airport, local boats were called in to rescue the passengers and crew on board.
According to officials, seven people were admitted to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six people remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them are out of danger.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
The airline and US Navy said the plane had landed before reaching the runway in Laguna.
Eyewitnesses said the plane appeared to have crossed the runway.
U.S. Coast Guard officials said the plane was too small.
"That's great," said Janes.
Mr Jain said he and his colleagues had difficulty getting out of the plane's emergency exit through shallow water.
He stated that the flight attendants were frightened and shouted and he sustained minor injury on his head.
The sailors, who were working on renovating a sea bridge nearby, used a wind-powered boat to evacuate people, which helped the plane to land at about 100 feet (30 meters) below sea level, the US Navy said.
Data from the aviation safety network shows that over the past two decades, PNG-registered aircraft have crashed, killing 111 people, but none of them involved Air New Guinea.
Timeline of a woman's life at night.
The prosecution on Saturday again considered the argument of the accused in the case of burning a missing woman alive in 2014.
As an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis, U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlatt testified for hours.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the details of the nightly moves of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telles and the 19-year-old deceased Jessica Chambers.
Contrary to his earlier assertions, Clarion Ledger reported that using location information collected from multiple cellphones, it was understood that he was with the Teles Chambers on the evening of the day of the incident.
At the time when the accused claimed that he was close to his friend Michael Sanford, information gathered from the cell phone indicated that he was close to the Chambers, and the police spoke to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford admitted he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by his lawyer whether it was true that he had been in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "That's a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Teles said they had known each other for two weeks at the time of Chambers' death.
Cell phone records indicate that they had only known each other for a week.
After the chamber's death, Rowlatt said he removed messages, calls and contact information from the teleconferences.
"She's gone from my life," he said.
The final decision is expected to be made starting Sunday.
The judge is expected to rule on the matter the same day.

Another black woman?!
A NY-based lawsuit was filed against the couple for the "racist" message.
A New York couple has filed a lawsuit against a New York couple after they received a message from their mother complaining that they were "another black woman."
The couple denied the racial allegations and said the case was a form of extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, resented knowing that Giselle Maurice was black on her first day of work in 2016 when she came to look after her child.
"No, once again, a black woman," Linzi Plasco-Flaxman said in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice himself twice.
The New York Post reported that when Amalie learned of the "unstable" Placeco Flexman, she told him that her predecessor was an African American, that she had worked very poorly, and that she meant to be a Filipino.
Maurice was paid a day's wages and sent home on an Uber.
The Mauris couple are demanding a monthly salary of $350 for six months as compensation for their dismissal. This is said to be their top-earning salary, but there are no contracts.
"I'll make them understand that they can't do things like this," she said in a post on Friday.
The couple objected to the claim that they were racist. After speaking out against them in a way that hurt their feelings, they said that they could not be trusted and that they had no choice but to quit.
"My wife sent me a message that I didn't want to say."
But they arent foolproof.
"We're not racist," her husband, Joel Placeco, told the Post.
"If you're going to have kids, are you going to be willing to give up your child for someone else?"
Your newborn baby?
No, never.”
Describing the case as "robbery," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife gave birth to their child and that they were "in a very difficult situation."
Are you going to follow someone like that?
"I don't think that's a good idea," he added.
While the legal case is still going on, the verdict quickly made the couple infamous on social media, discrediting their conduct and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared that their readers would not agree with the book.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, wrote in a letter: "Before it was published, it was very difficult to find ourselves in the place of someone reading it for the first time.
It's interesting to know what we know now about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the book, was inspired by a little doll, and expressed confidence that the work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the work after his death was "bitter and sweet."
She described Paddington as a "very important member of the family" and added that her father was extremely proud of her victory.
"He was a quiet person, a quiet person," she said.
Paddington was a reality to him, like you're a really smart kid, and we're very proud of what they're doing.
I think he saw the success of Paddington that way.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he would have given the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
With her daughter on board, she rushed to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, and the doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
“Nad would always be called upon to say she was in a very bad condition, and she didn’t expect she would survive.” said Ms. Ednan-Laperos.
"I got a call from Nade that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did the same.
I said, "Sweetie, I love you so much.
I'll get back to you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that had been given to her to pump her heart were slowly draining from her body, leaving her body.
She died shortly before it was over.
I had to wait for it all.
I couldn't cry or scream anymore, I had my family and others around me.
I had to keep it all under wraps.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperos, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers.
"No one knows," they said.
“I kept my head down and tears were pouring down my cheeks all the time.
It was hard to explain, but the feeling of sympathy for Nadezhda was palpable during the flight.
He needed my love and care.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards are sent by women to prevent suicides from crossing bridges.
Two women who lost their loved ones are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Postcards, including inspirational messages and the phone number of people who need to call for help, are thrown at Wilsch Bridge by Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys.
His son, Taylor, had been suffering from depression since he was 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
He said, "I don't want to be like them.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, remembers that his son was a rising chef and the owner of a smile that attracted everyone.
"He was known by all for his wits.
They always say that a smile is the best way to brighten up a room.
He left his job before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Taylor's 11-year-old brother committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I've always been concerned about the consequences of evolution.
Miss Davis created the cards to let people know that there are a lot of people around you, including friends, who can help you find and talk to you.
Shut up, you need to talk.
Miss Humphries, a friend of Miss Davis's for years, lost her partner, Mark, at the age of 15, shortly after his mother's death.
“He never said he felt sad or depressed or anything else,” she said.
"In the last few days, we've noticed that his character has changed.
On Christmas Eve, he didn't say anything to them or look them in the eye.
They said his death was a big tragedy for them, but they could have endured it. "It caused a huge rift in the family.
We were all wiped out.
But we have to keep going and keep going."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance when the FBI begins an investigation.
"I felt that if we had got what he wanted - a time-bound inquiry, a limited inquiry - we could have brought some unity," he said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "involved" in the partisan divide.
Why don't the FBI and the FBI investigate?
It's time for their discontent.
With just five weeks to go for the mid-term elections on November 6, Republicans are expected to be weakened in their efforts to take him to the country's highest court if he fails to win, as expected.
George W. Bush calls on the senator and ratifies Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and through him meets Bush and his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What about the FBI's report?
The Senate is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, and vice-president Mike Pence could be confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea is falling
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byung-seung cited data from the South Unification Ministry, which showed that there were 1,127 defectors, up from 2,076 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons were increased border control between North Korea and China and increased rates for smugglers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public response.
Most defectors from North have been granted citizenship by South Korea over time.
Seoul says some 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have passed through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which is more secure between the two Koreas.
China considers these dissidents not only as refugees but also as illegal immigrants, and often forcibly repatriated them.
The relationship between North and South <0xE2><0x80><0x93> while still virtually at war <0xE2><0x80><0x93> has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This comes after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June in which they jointly decided to work towards a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday accused the US of imposing sanctions.
"While we have no confidence in the United States, there is no certainty in our international security, and therefore it is not possible for us to pursue first unilateral disarmament," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "unmadi" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "unmadi" and said she was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I think if a woman spoke like that right now, she would have called them 'unmade'," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times he was very emotional while talking about his family and his high school days, raising his voice and carrying on.
Kavanaugh said the charges against him were a "ridiculous and cowardly act of character assassination" carried out by a group of angry liberals over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi noted that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he shows an anti-Democrat attitude.
"I think that kind of statements and the way he's talked about Clinton and the Democrats make him unfit," she added.
Pelosi expressed disappointment when asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh if he cemented his position and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm saying - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court, not just where he is right now," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about what Kavanaugh's policies would look like against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, especially when he was considered a conservative attorney.
Kavanog ignored questions about whether the Supreme Court could overturn some of its decisions in his affirmations.
"This is not the time for a man who's smart and easily influenced to go to court and say, 'That's great,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to use it.
It's a legitimate insult, an intense rage that goes on for months and years, but they can't show it without crying.
"Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years ago, 'We cry when we are angry.'
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “The woman who was an executive at a place helped me a lot. She said that when she was angry, they would cry too, and she would say that when she was angry, she developed the habit of starting to cry. She would tell the person she was talking to, “You know, I’m crying because I’m sad.
I am furious."
Then they continued.
I thought it was a wise decision."
It is also permissible to shed tears for anger, but they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One thing that stands out in my memory from my previous work is that one day in an office where there were more men than women, I was crying out of unexpressed anger--a woman older than me, a manager whom I had always dreaded, grabbed me by the scarf around my neck and dragged me down the steps.
"They don't want to see you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're so sad that they're happy that they can make you happy.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with him on Garihart's race for president.
In 1987, when Hart was taken off the boat by Monkey Business for an illicit relationship, Miss Schroeder became so frustrated that she thought there was no reason to consider running for president.
"It wasn't a decision that was made lightly," she said with a smile after 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates at the time, and they never wanted anyone else.
Some called it the "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was so long in coming, she was too far behind to raise money, so she vowed not to compete until she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She realized that some of her supporters had paid the men $1,000, while she had only paid them $250.
She asked, "Do you think I would benefit from it?"
She was very emotional when she said in her speech that she was not running an official campaign - thanks to her supporters, anger at the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than on representatives - and anger at gender discrimination.
"I think everyone would have thought Nadia would be tired," he said.
"You may have thought that Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
“I remember thinking, what are they going to put in my grave?
"Was she crying?"
How does the U.S.-China trade war benefit Beijing?
Pragati said that when the trade war between the US and China is over and the war is over, it will be good for Beijing.
US President Donald Trump had earlier this year threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese export goods, including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most important event this week was the new tariffs on nearly $200 million worth of goods, nearly half of which came from China to the United States.
Each time Beijing retaliated in the same coin, it recently raised tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on 60 million-plus American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the US, and the world's second-largest economy is not going to lose its luster any time soon.
"For Chinese President Xi Jinping, it's a shame to publicly bow down to Washington, but it's also a shame to bow down to the US."""
But experts say if Beijing can do things right, the U.S. trade war tensions between the two economies will reduce their dependence on each other and things will be in China's favour in the long run.
"If a political decision is actually made in Washington, D.C., or Beijing, and it creates an economic disaster in either of the two countries, the outcome is likely to be more dangerous than what observers have concluded," Abigail Grease, a research associate specializing in Asia at the Center for New American Security, said in a statement.
Syria's interior minister says it's "ready" for refugees to return
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the country that was devastated by the seven-year war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Maullam said that the country's infrastructure is improving.
He said, "Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure due to the progress made in countering terrorism."
The government is trying to normalize and rehabilitate the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
There are now all the necessary facilities for the return of the refugees. Terrorism and unilateral economic policies have affected their daily lives and forced them to leave the country.

Europe's Ryder Cup triumphed again in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating Team USA. The team won the final score of 10.5 <0xE2><0x80><0x93> 16.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France
It was the US' sixth consecutive defeat on European soil, and they have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Jorne, Europe once again won the title by scoring 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, who has struggled for most of the tournament, put his tee shot into the water on the 16th hole of Par-3, when he surrendered to Francesco Molinari in the match.
Italian golfer Molinari Thantera was one of four players to score 5-0 in every round of the tournament, starting in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth lost to European team's lowest-ranked player Thorb John of Denmark in the 5th and 4th round.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2 & 1 to England's Ian Potter, who was playing his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who played in eight Ryder Cups, was one of the tournament's all-time winners with 25.5 points.
"I'm not the only one who's crying, but I can't control myself this time.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm happy to have the cup back.
It’s all teamwork and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said of the European success.
He will hand over the torch to fellow golfer John Rahm, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods and I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Raham.
Tiger Woods has lost all four of his games in France, and he now holds the Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
With 14 major titles to his name, Jack Nicholas was one of the greatest players of all time.
The U.S. team was struggling throughout the weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who had a great performance throughout the tournament.
"I'm proud of them, they fought," U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing game.
This morning we had a blast in Europe.
But we were destroyed.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of them played well.
We will restructure, I will work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, we will move on.
I love these two and am proud to be their captain.
You are to be congratulated.
He's played better than us."
