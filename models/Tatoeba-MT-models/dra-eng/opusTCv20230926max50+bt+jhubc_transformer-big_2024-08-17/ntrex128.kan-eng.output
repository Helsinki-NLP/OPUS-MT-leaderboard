I'm worried about the "stupid"
Some AMs are concerned about a proposal to change their titles to the MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The problem arose due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Democrats across the country have expressed concern that the decision could be overturned.
"That rhymes with Twp and Pwp," said one Labour AM, who caused concern in his group.
For readers outside of Wales: twp in Welsh means unwise and pwp means feces.
A Playboy AM says the group is "dissatisfied" and suggested alternative names.
One Welsh Conservative said their group had an "open mind" about changing the name, but added that it was simply another form of Muppet or Stupid from the MWP.
In this case, Yorkshire pronounces the Welsh letter w in the same way as u pronounces it in English.
The Assembly Commission, which is drafting legislation to change the current name, said: "Members will have to make a final decision on the interpretation of what members of the House should be called."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission issued a public consultation on the proposals, which found overwhelming support for the so-called Welsh Parliament.
The commission was in favour of the title of AM, known as Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP received the most public support.
While AMs suggest alternative options, a consensus decision could be a headache for incumbent incumbent incumbent Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms includes other changes to the functioning of the legislature, including rules for disqualifying AMs and the design of a committee system.
AMs have the right to vote on the question of what to call themselves when discussing legislation.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether or not to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The vote was part of a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has also insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents possession over its territory, and has repeatedly objected to EU and NATO membership.
Ivanov said he did not respect the vote of the Macedonian president, Gyorge, who was opposed to the name change.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Ziv, argue that the name change is a price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells are silent when the Harlem churches are struggling.
Mr. Adams said, "The old men I spoke with say that historically when looked at, there was a bar and a church in every corner."
"Today, there are no two."
He said he could understand some of the issues.
He said, "Today, people are connected in different ways.
"Nowadays, people don't go to bars to buy clothes."
As for the churches, they worry that the money they sell will not last as long as they thought, "and tomorrow they will return to where they started their journey."
He went on to say that churches could be removed and condominiums could be built, and people who had no inclination to help their neighbors could live in these buildings.
"Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white. They want the day to come soon when these churches will be closed, because it is far from the people who come to live in these condominiums to be members of these churches," he said.
Both churches were built by white religious groups before Harlem became a black capital - before becoming a metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin's a similar community decades later.
The Methodist religious group of original whites went out in the 1930s.
Soon a religious group of black worshippers took possession of the building.
A religious group of blacks, led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, took control of St. Martin's. Reverend John Howard Johnson led the fight against retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main street, who refused to hire blacks or promote them.
The building suffered considerable damage in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's parish followers were planning to rebuild the building, Carillon took over the job.
Father Johnson's son and heir to the St. Martins, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The experts who played Carillon in July called it by a different name: "Cultural Property" and "Inalienable Historical Instrument."
It was also the world’s first carillon played by a black musician, Dinicio A. Lind, said Tiffany Ng, a specialist at the University of Michigan. Lind had moved to Riverside Church 18 years earlier to play an even bigger carillon.
According to Mr. Meriwether, St. Martin's did not change him.
The events of the past few months in St. Martin can be said to have been complicated by architects and contractors. Some were brought in by church lay leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Westry, the parish councillor from Le Leader, expressed its concern in a letter to the Diocese in July - although Westry had no responsibility for taking on the architects and contractors who sent the Diocese, the Diocese was instructing Westy to pay its "costs."
He said that some of the parishioners complained that the diocese's role was not transparent.
A shark injured a 13-year-old child while diving in California
Officials said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who jumped into the water to catch a lobster on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Bacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego, Hammel said he heard a boy screaming for help on Saturday morning while he was diving with a friend for about half an hour and went on a boat with a group of people and pulled the boy out of the water.
"""At first, Hamal thought it was the excited cries of a boy holding a lobster, but when he listened carefully, he knew that the boy was crying out in pain, 'It bit me!'"
I've been bitten!'
Hamal went to the boy and said, "The bone of his entire neck has been torn."
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego and the hospital said his condition was critical.
It is not known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
According to Life Guard Captain Larry Jailes, who spoke to the media, a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
He added that the victim had sustained serious injuries on his upper body.
The authorities also closed the access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamies in Ecinitas for 48 hours for the purposes of inquiry and safety.
There are about 135 shark species in the area, most of which are not considered dangerous.
St. Petersburg's plans to expand into the UK market
Beauty Isles, with its department store-style, expert assistants, will give a tough competition to boots, super-drugs and debentures.
As fashion and homeware sales decline, entering the ever-growing <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market in the UK, the company will set up and test its large Beauty Isles across 11 stores across the country, with plans to open more stores next year if successful.
What used to be reserved for TVs, microwaves and homewares is now being invested in cosmetics as supermarkets compete for cosmetics.
For the first time, the company plans to offer 3,000 beauty products from brands such as Revlon, SC, Tweezerman and Dr. Papa.
Products such as L'Oreal, Mabelline and Burt's Bees, which are currently in use, also take on a brand equivalent of products available in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also restoring its buttik make-up line with the aim of selling more of these vegetarian-friendly products.
In addition, one of the two Sans Barais stores, which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second store, which will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham, will also be offering perfume retailer Fragrance Shop concessions.
With the rise in online shopping and the habit of buying small items from convenience stores on a daily basis, there is a lot of work to be done to convince people to visit the supermarkets.
According to Mike Coop, chief executive of Sense Barrys, their outlets often look like department stores and the supermarket chain will compete with competitors Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sens Barris has been putting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several habitats, both of which were bought two years ago.
In the past, the supermarket's efforts to revive its cosmetics and drug categories have failed.
Sense Barris began a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute over how to share the proceeds from the drugstores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was formulated after Sens Barris sold his 281-store drug business to Celecio, owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy stores, three years earlier for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds said it will play a key role in the project by adding more luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posey and Weissee, across four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Business Director of Sans-Barres, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our Beauty Isles to make the store environment more attractive for our customers.
We have also invested heavily in providing specialized training to colleagues who are always available to give advice.
Our range of brands are designed to cater to everyone's needs, and with the glamorous atmosphere and convenient location, we have emerged as a go-to beauty product for eradicating old shopping habits."
Peter Jones, the current owner of Vlabi, has walked away from the <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal.
Jones became the 'Kendamal' as he withdrew from Peter Jones of Dragons Den fame's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand deal to deal with her new contracts with TV presenter Willaby Marks and Spencer and ITV
There's no time like the present for home decor and home decor.
The pair's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old announced his departure from the show on Instagram.
Jones's anger was sparked by the late withdrawal of the lucrative lifestyle brand of Dragons' Den fame, Peter Jones, from the deal, in order to focus on her new bumper contracts with current Willaby Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was angered by a crucial visit at Jones's business office in Marlow, Birmingham, on Tuesday, when a gold-plated TV girl said she couldn't give Jones time for his homeware and accessory brand Trulli because of her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million deal.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and it was estimated that it would increase Vilaby's fortune by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Shortly after announcing her departure on Instagram, 37-year-old Vilby Jones left the UK to travel to her holiday home far away.
According to one source: "Holly has always preferred the first one to the true.
That would have supported her fortune for a long time and would have kept her popular for a few more decades.
Her decision to withdraw from the agreement came as a surprise to all concerned.
No one could have predicted what would happen on Tuesday, for the launch would happen the next day.
The warehouse at Marlow HQ is full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain’s most popular stars, will cause millions of damage to the company and further delay its launch because the company has invested large amounts in clothing and homeware products ranging from cushions and candles.
This will end a long friendship.
Vilaby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have known Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
He co-founded Trulia with Willaby and Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as president in March.
The pair spend the holidays together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willaby will be the brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Aunt MacPartlin, host of I'm a Celebrity M on ITV.
A person close to Jones said last night, "We don't like to comment on his business practices."
The first words that come to mind are, "Then we fell in love."
He joked that he would be criticized by the news media for making a note that some consider "unfit for the presidency" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why didn't President Trump do it?
Trump said in the voice of his "news presenter."
"I didn't leave anything."
He said he was interested in meeting Kim for the second time since his first visit to Singapore in June, which Trump described as a big step towards making North Korea nuclear-free.
Nuclear talks have stalled, however.
Three months after a summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders who met at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the U.S. had not "responded appropriately" when North Korea previously decided to take arms embargo measures.
Instead, he said, the goal was to increase pressure by imposing US sanctions.
Trump said in his rally speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are very good," he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Our relationship is in a good place."
Efforts to improve their relations with Kim have yielded positive results -- thus ending rocket tests, aiding in the release of hostages and bringing back the remains of American servicemen to their homeland, he said.
When it comes to his relationship with Kim, he's been very supportive.
Trump said, "It's easy to be in the president's position, but instead of helping the 10,000 people who are trying to get into this crowded place, we want to allow about 200 people to stand."
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, they were told that there was no need for foreign NGOs.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboks population would be evacuated, it did not declare a national calamity requiring international assistance.
"In a number of cases, unfortunately, he has made it very clear that he does not need international help, so this is a bit of a challenge," said Ku.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it's unclear if overseas staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said: Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
While earthquakes are a frequent occurrence in Indonesia, it is clear that that country is not ready to face a natural disaster.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are rarely found in coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was expected to occur, the loss of life could not be avoided due to the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu.
In general, traveling between the many islands in Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters continue to complicate transportation.
The hospital ship in Lombok has sailed to Palu to treat the victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Joko is running out of money to run for re-election next year.
Jokowi also faces sectarian riots in Indonesia, with many members of the Muslim community following a narrow view of their faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and thousands more were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as weapons from other countries.
WATCH: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores his maiden goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge avoided defeating Liverpool by scoring in the 89th minute of the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
At 1-0, Sturridge received a pass from Jer Don Shakeri when he was about 30 yards away from Chelsea goal.
He taped the ball to his left before scooping it into a remote post.
Due to their kick, the ball bounced higher than the box and went to the top corner on the right side of the net.
Finally, Kepa Arizabalagana, who was trying to stop the ball, passed over his head and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to stand in a proper position and take the ball under control and players like Shock always play the ball as long as possible, so I tried to get as much time as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I was able to get the ball in the net, but only once, and then I hit the ball.
Belgium's Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute to give Chelsea a 1-0 lead in half time.
The bluest striker kicked the ball towards Mateo Kovacic before going near midfield and running towards Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go in the midfield.
He then threw the ball into the box with a brilliant throw.
Hazard also went to the tip of the post netting and kicked the ball with his left leg, causing Allison Becker of Liverpool to pass.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will face Videotone in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference that waves of up to 20 feet were generated by Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake and that many people were trapped under a rubber pile of collapsed buildings.
With a population of more than 380,000, Palu was filled with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the murder.
The investigation into the murder began this morning after the body of a woman was found in Merseyside, Burkina Faso.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found near the Grayson Museum on John Street at 7.55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested on the last suspicion
The police have appealed to the people in the area to inform them if they have heard or seen anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagen said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would urge you to contact us if you see or hear anything suspicious on John Street in Burkina Faso."
I would also like to request taxi drivers that they may have captured something on the dash cam footage of their vehicle which may provide important information in our investigation. So contact us.
A police spokesman said the woman, whose body was found, is a resident of Barkenhead and her body was found inside a property.
The woman's friends arrived at the scene in the afternoon and asked where the body was found in the morning.
The police said that the investigation is on and they are trying to contact the family members of the deceased.
A taxi driver at Grayson Muse tried to enter his flat but no one was allowed to enter or exit the building, police said.
He didn't want to talk about what happened there.
Residents are expected to be evacuated in a few hours.
"I have heard a police officer telling a person that the entire world is being treated as a place of crime.
A woman came to the scene of the crime.
She said: "It's a terrible situation.
By 2 p.m., two police vans were inside a cordon or police fence, while another van was parked outside.
Several police officers inside the cordon were supervising the blocks of the flats.
Any person with information is asked to DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 by entering 30 September’s log 247.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is a monument that has recently been the target of controversy for 'creating a new history'
A boycott would do justice to many of England's cultural and religious artifacts destroyed in a Taliban-style fashion by Cromwell's furious Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion as "stupid" and an "effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of the statues that the Oliver Cromwell statue outside the Palace of Westminster would be the subject of controversy.
During the English Civil War, Cromwell neither commanded nor executed the idol-destroying operation.
Thomas, Cromwells forefather in the preceding century, may have been sacrificed for nothing.
Sir William Hammo Thornikraft represented Cromwell as a mirror of the 19th century plebiscite and is part of the personification historiography that many people believe may hold in high esteem even today.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "In the late 19th century Cromwell was respected by many compared to today because he worked to protect Parliament from external pressures from the rule of kings.
However, there is some debate as to whether it is completely accurate.
The mid-17th century conflict led to the further development of our nation, and it is only true that Cromwell was the only known figure to represent one side of that divide.
His achievements as a Lord Protector should be celebrated and remembered."
Farmer stabbed to death in China
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China.
The South China Morning Post reported Sunday that the man, who was lying in a pool of blood at a market place in Lupan Shui in Guizhou province, was only identified by his nickname "Yuan" after his arteries were cut.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer in Zhining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to vaccinate all pigs at a pig farm.
According to a report, he had come to the market with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning his cousin saw his dead body and noticed that the door of the adjoining pig farm was open.
He said that the large male pig at the slaughterhouse had blood in his mouth.
According to the report, forensic examination confirmed that the pig, weighing 550 pounds, bit the farmer.
Jiang, the deceased's cousin, nicknamed "Wu," told Evening News that "my cousin's legs were soaked in blood and disfigured."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
An hour later, his body was found.
The animal that killed Yuan was not his or his brother's relative.
The market manager told Evening News that while police were collecting evidence at the scene, the pig was tied up to prevent anyone from attacking it.
His family members and market officials are in talks to pay compensation for Yuan's death, the report said.
Although such incidents are rare, incidents of attacks on humans by pigs have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their garden and caused serious injuries to the man's head.
Ten years ago, a pig farmer in Wales, weighing 650 pounds, was run over by his wife while she was trying to injure him near his tractor.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs generally do not have a tendency to attack, but the taste of the blood can "stimulate" them.
"They are playing.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You have to respect them."
Hurricane Rosa will cause widespread rain in the southwestern U.S.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to make landfall along Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S.
As of 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, Rosa's wind was blowing at a speed of 85 mph, a Category 1 storm, and saw it 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
She is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a ring-shape is forming over the Pacific Ocean and heading east towards the west coast of the US. On Monday, a tropical storm in the form of Baja California will approach the island, penetrating the southwestern US and pushing the tropical humidity northward.
On Monday, some parts of Mexico could see up to 10 inches of rain.
The storm is expected to bring widespread flooding to the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain falling in the desert creates dangerous floods, waste flows, and landslides.
The extreme tropical humidity causes about 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in the southwest, mainly in most of Arizona.
Tropical rain showers everywhere are likely to cause flooding due to deteriorating conditions.
It is very dangerous to walk in the desert because of the tropical rain.
The deep ravines are converted into overflowing rivers due to heavy rains and the localized high-flowing winds and dust appear due to stormy rains.
The approaching cyclonic storm is expected to bring heavy rain locally in the southern California coastal region.
A little more than half an inch of rain can cause a bit of waste to run off and the roads slick.
This will be the region's first rainy season.
Some tropical rain showers will move into Arizona on Sunday evenings and early Monday mornings, followed by scattered showers everywhere on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Heavy rain is expected to continue into Tuesday.
Temperatures will continue to fluctuate across the U.S. as the Arctic cools down in October, but warm weather will continue in the tropics.
This is often due to changes in temperature.
Temperatures across the U.S. are expected to drop on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the summer heat will continue and spread widely.
The central and eastern parts of the U.S. begin October with hot temperatures and are expected to experience temperatures ranging from the southern plains to the northeast as high as 80 degrees.
New York City is expected to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is 10 degrees above average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, the chances of warmer than average temperatures in the eastern U.S. are higher in the early days of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political strife continued by preventing broadcasters from airing Friday's hearing, which was due to end on Friday, as a result of Arizona Senator Jeff Flack's agreement with the FBI to hold a week-long hearing on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was 100 percent true that Kevano caught her in a drunken state during a high school party and tried to take her clothes off.
Kevano said in his strong testimony that it did not happen and that it was 100 percent true.
It was viewed by more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen reported on Friday.
The agency was calculating the average viewing rate for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available on other networks that broadcast the evidence, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually faces a slight problem in calculating the number of people watching in the offices.
In a sense, the number of viewers watching the trial was the same as the number of people watching a football game or an Academy Award.
Several people on the Fox News channel have expressed support for Kevano's appointment, saying he led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day of court hearings.
ABC was in second place with a viewership of 3.26 million.
Nielsen said that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
People's interest was rekindled after the trial.
He was the center of attention in Tampa on Friday.
After a statement from the general Republican office that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was targeted on CNN and CBS cameras as he entered the elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday morning, and protesters shouted slogans against him.
He didn't raise his eyes for several minutes as he was humiliated during a live broadcast on CNN.
A woman said, "I'm coming for you."
Do you think he's telling the truth?
"When women are weak, you are strong."
Flack said he had a lot to say at the committee hearing before the elevator doors closed.
Cable and broadcast networks later went live, with the Judiciary Committee voting to send the entire Senate to vote on the Kavanaugh nomination.
But Flake said he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominees next week, at the request of the minority Democrats.
He was partly convinced by the words of his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Blake made his decision after speaking with Coons and several senators afterward.
Flack's decision was strong, as it was clear that Republicans would not be able to vote to approve Kavanaugh until after the trial was over.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "playing a political game" over Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing a political game" over her plans to leave the European Union, regardless of Britain's future and national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview published alongside the May interview, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, said May's claim that the checkers had a Brexit plan and that Britain and the EU should collect their tariffs was "absolutely absurd."
Wade Sims shooting case: Police arrest Dyton Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the death of 20-year-old basketball player Wade Simms in LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said a 20-year-old man, Dayton Simpson, had been arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and said Sims lost her glasses during the clash.
CBS affiliate WAFB reported that the police found glasses at the scene and told them that Simpson had DNA on it.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to the shooting.
According to the lawyer, his contract was worth $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office, which released an initial report Friday, said the death was caused by a bullet passing from the head into the neck.
The Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and the citizens of the area all congratulated the department for cooperating with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Allewa thanked law enforcement in the area for their "gratitude and fairness."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
"You always worry about that," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocat<0xC3><0xA9>petl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after activity increased in the crater and saw 183 gas emissions and ash in a 24-hour period.
The Centre was monitoring many sounds and vibrations.
Images on social media showed layers of thin ash coating on car windshields in Mexico City's neighboring city of Xochimilco.
Earth physicists have observed an increase in activity in a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goo," has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of Independence Day
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police in Barcelona on Saturday, and thousands gathered in demonstrations by opponents to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatists blocked by riot police threw eggs at them, painted powdery, and created dust clouds on the streets usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes broke out again when the police used their lathis to control the mob.
For several hours, pro-independence groups shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive," while federalist protesters shouted "Long Live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, according to local newspapers.
The October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but tensions in the pro-independence region increased a year after the secessionist Catalans celebrated.
Those who opposed separatism largely boycotted the vote, although the number of people who did vote was small, and voters chose to be independent in large numbers.
About 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to prevent them from voting at polling stations across the region, according to Catalan officials.
Pro-independence groups staged a demonstration in support of the National Police on Friday night.
However, the show had to take a different path.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer confident about the chances of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are trapped," he said.
Despite a hard-fought victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties are struggling to maintain their momentum as many of their famous leaders remain in self-imposed exile or in detention this year as they await trial for their role in plebiscites and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, 42, a mechanic, recorded the protest on her phone in support of the police, and she said the clash had been instigated by politicians on both sides.
He said: "It's getting worse.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in an Eastern prison since last year's end of the trial, announced that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the oppression in democratic values and the oppression we have faced from the Spanish government," he said.
London derby: Man arrested after car rams into home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly rushing a car into a house in London's Duryea.
The incident took place at Ballinagard Crescent around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Debt inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At one point, the car may have even had a CD-ROM drive.
Menga strike Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> Menga scored his first goal for Livingston.
Promoted to manager, Livingston surprised the Rangers by defeating Steven Gerrard just twice in his 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike made a difference because Gary Holt's team equaled Hibernian in second place.
Gerard remains undefeated in the Premiership this season and next Sunday he will face leaders Harts, who are trailing by eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended his unbeaten run in the division to six games, and has yet to taste defeat since head coach Holt replaced Kenny Mailer last month.
Livingston missed out on opportunities against tough visitors
The Holt team should have been ahead of them before they scored, as their straight walks were causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson struggled in his attempt when the goal was scored despite the break, then Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his effort broadly as he skimmed across the goal to block Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them because they knew they could cause trouble for the visitors at other times.
And the decisive goal came in the same way.
Rangers gave away a free-kick and Livingston scored an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson getting together to face Meng, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the box.
By that time, Home Defense was undefeated despite the Rangers dominating the parade and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unaffected.
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos trashed a save from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor turned down Scott Pitman's offer and Lithgow flicked another Livingston set wide from play.
The Crosses arrived at Livingston's box and were cleaned regularly, but two penalty claims - one after Halkett's challenge on the Substitute Glenn Middleton and one after the handball - were withdrawn.
"Wonderful" from Livingston
Alasdair Lamont of Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing performance and results from Livingston.
For a man, he was the best, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His style of play and the staff have not changed since he returned to the top flight, but Holt should be congratulated for the way he has equipped the team since his arrival
There are many heroes.
Captain Holke was immense, he put forward the best of the best organized defense, but Menga made Conor Goldson and Joe Vorrell always busy.
However, there was a lack of motivation for the Rangers.
Although sometimes he played just as well as he did under Gerard, he was below those standards.
He had a final ball shortage - he had penetrated the home side only once - and it was a warning bell for the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and blue skies.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to repair ties between NATO allies.
They also disagree on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne for the opening of a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had gathered there to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - a lot of them Kurdish - expressed their disapproval, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decisions to welcome him into the country.
The dual protests reflected a split of visitors who hailed from some German Turks as heroes and who were abused by others as absolutists.
A cyclist was killed in a road accident in Deptford
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident took place at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Best Wood Street and Evelyn Street, the busiest road in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics took care of him, but the man died at the scene.
The accident took place after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run case a month ago in Childers Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in riot
The prison's office said six prison officials were injured in the disturbance at the high-security men's prison.
The chaos broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and it is still going on.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to control the rioting that has been taking place in a division that consists of eight inmates.
The officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the incident that is taking place in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff were injured.
"We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and they will spend even more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the jail was treated at a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called to jail when they were attacked with pool balls on staff.
Hurricane Rosa poses a flash flooding threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (areas of writing that may benefit)
Although tropical depressions rarely strike Arizona, they increase the risk of flash floods as Hurricane Rosa is likely to drain its remaining power in the Desert Southwest next week.
The National Weather Service has already released flash flood warnings for parts of southern and eastern Nevada from western Arizona, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, as well as southeastern California and Utah on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain expected to arrive late on Monday.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said, "Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical cyclone or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
Recent National Hurricane Center models have estimated rainfall of 2 to 4 inches with individual doses of 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with the individual amount likely to be up to 4 inches.
For those who are out of the flash flood danger, the rain of Rosa may prove to be a blessing as the area is a drought-prone area.
While flooding is a very serious concern, this rain could be of some benefit as the South West is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. draft monitor, 40 percent of Arizonans are experiencing at least severe drought, which is the second-highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa causes landslides on Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still on the storm's right, was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning and was moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing cold water in the Pacific and therefore its power is diminished.
Thus, it is expected to make landfall on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico on the right of the tropical cyclone.
Heavy rains in some parts of Mexico can pose a significant flood risk.
"Baja is expected to receive 3 to 6 inches of rain from California to northwest Sonora, and could be as much as 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then be followed by a tropical storm that will move north across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday, and it will pass through Arizona and southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall over Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause fatal flash flooding and cause debris to flow in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and another 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Mid Somerton in an injured condition at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was stated to be in "stable" condition.
Avon and Somerset police said one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Rod Stock area.
Authorities have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered "evil and anger" from the Democratic Party.
"To vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a vote campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "experienced the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his oath-taking.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, asserting and emotively denying the allegations that Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulted him decades ago when he was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his allegations.
On Saturday, the president said the Americans were "witnessed to by the magnificence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"The vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time as a jurist with an outstanding record in public service," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
When talking about the importance of Republican voting in midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
"There are only five weeks left for a major election in our lifetime.
I don't really get it, but I'm really excited."
That's why I'm fighting for the best."
Trump argued that Democrats are aiming to "oppose and deter."
The first major procedural vote of the Senate session for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected later Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is expected to rise.
At least 384 people were killed and many others drowned when giant waves hit beaches after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit off the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
Waves as high as six metres (18 feet) hit the beach at dusk while hundreds gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The quake was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When yesterday's tsunami threat came, people were still active on the beach and they didn't run away immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for BNPB, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, told a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami not only took itself, but cars, sticks, houses, and everything that was above the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 mph) in the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said that some of them had climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were shifted to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquake tremors were felt in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
A statement issued by Indonesia's Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said that the geography of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have enlarged the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, while 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage were most likely in Donggala, a region close to the epicentre of the earthquake, on the coast 300 km (190 mi) north of Palau.
Nugroho said from Donggala that "communications have been completely crippled without any information."
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"It's already tragic, but it could be even worse."
Officials said the agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for not informing it that a tsunami had hit the island, but the waves had blown by the time the warnings were issued.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building can be heard shouting out loud warnings about a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the news.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts by cutting off communications around Palu.
The army has also started sending cargo planes to help Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but food and other basic necessities for those who are being evacuated are very urgently needed.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia is more than 800.
Thats very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that the World Vision staff at Donggala have safely reached Palu city where the employees have taken shelter in tarpaulin shelters set up in the office premises, and have seen the scenes of destruction on their way.
He said: "I've seen a lot of houses destroyed.
Thats very bad.
Some also complained that even though aid groups have begun serious work of disaster relief, foreign aid workers with deep expertise are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and personnel from foreign countries can only be allowed there if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasnt happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Alia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After saying, "The government is right, this is a national disaster," he said, "Although we can open up to international aid, we still have no status on it."
As the second night falls on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those still missing hope that their loved ones can be miracles flashing through the thick story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble beside her mother's body for two days.
The coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Those who were caught in the Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Zendon recalled that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Rowa Hotel in the paragliding community, he had sent WhatsApp messages frantically to the contestants who were attending the beach festival.
Their messages were replaced by a pair of blue checkmarks with just one gray checkmark.
He said: "The message has not been delivered.
Thieves stole $26,750 during an ATM recalibration in Newport, NY
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's workers while they were refilling an ATM in Newport on Friday morning.
"The driver was emptying the ATM at the Entertainment Complex and preparing to deliver more money,"" wrote Dennis McCarthy in a press release."
While he was mugged, another man "ran out from behind a Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money reserved for delivery.
According to the press release, witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to "Yay"
Kanye West has changed his name to "Yay."
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, she wrote: "I'm officially called Kanye West.
West, 41, has been nicknamed "Ye" for some time and used that name for my eighth album title, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandi.
The show's creators said he was a replacement for Ariana Grande, a singer who canceled the show for "emotional reasons."
In addition to being an acronym for his current professional name, West has previously stated that the term has a religious significance to him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year while discussing his album title on radio host Big Boy.
"I am you, you are me, we are you.
It just goes to show that it's a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West organizers, Jay-Z, have also added hyphens and capitals or run without them.
Mexico's Amlodipine vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, while a peaceful demonstration was taking place in Plaza, at a time when left-wing student movements were rooting across Latin America, soldiers opened fire and killed 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by offering a monthly stipend to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities would also attract youth to criminal groups.
The U.S. economy will double
Kai-Foo Lee, an investor and AI expert who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field as China becomes more active in artificial intelligence.
Although the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy, these notes have been coming after various parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling AI research budgets is a good start as all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are exploring the next innovation in AI," Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being in the United States.
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, published his book "AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, which also invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China's leading AI companies.
He worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, and it beat out the American Othello player, and then he was executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee accepted past U.S. government technology contests, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify potential investigators.
Lee said researchers in the U.S. will have to work harder to win government grants.
"It's not China taking on academic leaders; it's corporates," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired scholars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
The changes in immigration policy will also help the U.S. increase its AI efforts, Lee said.
"I think green cards should be automatically issued to PhDs in AI," he said.
The State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation said the quality of educational work in China is low despite the fact that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the United States are funding people in educational institutions in much the same way that they are funding US researchers.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve stakeholders from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a select committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation trying to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has seen no growth in several months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had been blocking membership efforts for the European Union and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says the name of the neighboring country in its north asserts its right to its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gorz Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the referendum would meet the minimum 50 percent required for it to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by ratifying the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Joran Jave, argue that this is a price to be paid to enable Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from Yugoslavia's repression, to gain access to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, to enable young Macedonians to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this is the foundation of a safe life for all of us," Oliviera Georgievska, 79, said in Skopje.
Though it is not required by law to do so, a large number of MPs are committed to making the outcome of the vote decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission (SEC) said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 pm
However, in the last parliamentary election in 2016, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the registered voters who cast their ballot.
"For my children, for our place in Europe, I have come to vote," said Gjos Tanevsky, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Jeev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, opening the way for NATO and the European Union to join on September 30, 2018, in Srumika, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Coverdarkov was preparing a small platform and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads, not through the back door," Kavtarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we are proud of ourselves.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration."
The prime minister said membership of NATO would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the majority would be in favor of this, with more than 80 percent of our citizens voting for the EU and NATO," he said.
He said "yes" to the future of our country.
A poll published by the Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research last Monday said 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in a referendum - far less than the required turnout.
In another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, it was found that 57 percent of people were planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said yes.
A referendum requires 50 percent of the people and one vote.
The failure to hold a referendum represents the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero go through a complete Brighton defence for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shined in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute to make it look very easy.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Brighton defenders before being attacked in the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He went around a defender and then outwitted even more people at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he pushed the pass to the left and there was a sterling.
He used his first touch in the English forward box to get the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to trick Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and hit him to the right side of the net.
"There are some problems with Aguero's feet," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing them for 55, 60 minutes.
Now it is itself.
It was at that moment that they hit the ground running."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League clash.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent a beautiful throw ball to Leroy Sane for the length of the left flank.
Before taking Sterling to the remote post, San took a few touchdowns
The Sky Blue team's forward player, shortly before falling down, netted the ball.
The city will face Haffenheim in the Champions League at Rein-Knecker-Arena in Germany on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies.
Since the Nationals were out of the playoff convention, there was hardly any interest in starting another.
But Scherzer, who has always been competitive, wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, with a one-game lead against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West on condition that the Rockies have play-off implications.
The Rockies received a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
"Even if we're just playing, knowing Denver's atmosphere with people can knock a rubber on our fingers, and the other teams are playing at the highest level I could face this year.
Why shouldn't I compete?
The Nationals have yet to announce another starter for Sunday, but, in such a scenario, it is likely to give Shearer a chance to pitch.
Sherger, who will make his 34th start on Thursday, has started a bull pen session on Thursday and will take a regular rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's lead in West Virginia
On the controversy raised by the Supreme Court over its choice of Brett Kavanaugh, the president made an indirect reference to the importance of Republican votes in the midterm elections.
"Whatever we do, we will get results in November.
It's been five weeks since the most important election of our lives.
This is very important, I am not contesting this election, but it is like I am contesting this election.
"Trump continued: ""You're seeing the worst of it, you're seeing a bunch of hateful Democrats, you're seeing what's going on."
They are ready to take on the world in any way they can.
To hurt anyone, they ride on anyone to achieve power and control, all they need is power and control, but we don’t give them power.
He said the Democrats are using a strategy of "resistance and obstruction."
"You have also seen in the last four days that the Democrats have been "cruel and degrading and disgusting and dishonest."
He also mentioned the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a prominent Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Do you remember the answer?
You've made a record?
Whoa, whoa.
No, no, his body language was bad too. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The church is no longer a church.
When you speak your mind, it's inexhaustible.
This was a surprise to me when my local party's fighters voted for me.
Moreover, I am among those Labour MPs who have distanced themselves from what has been said in our minds.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was similarly treated for speaking out against Jewish bias.
In my case, I was criticized by the censor board for having a disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy has had disagreements with previous leaders on issues of responsible economic policy, national security, the importance of Europe, and other issues.
A notice from Nottingham East Labour's Friday meeting said: "We wanted the meetings to be comprehensive and productive."
As a local Labour MP, as I have seen in the last eight years, there was a GC meeting on Friday night.
Sadly, today's meeting did not sound like most of the other meetings, and the promise of a "moderate, meek" politics has been forgotten.
Dissent within the Labour Party is growing, and every opinion is considered, depending on whether it agrees with the party's leadership.
Whether it is national security or the EU's single market, everywhere, I, my colleagues, who used to share the same views in the past, now expect a change of stance.
No matter what I say, whenever I speak in public, there is a flood of negativity on social media, people say that I should be dropped, that I am doing harm to the politics of the Centre and that I should not be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I'm more than happy with what some of my colleagues have done for me.
I am amazed at the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues who face sexual or racial harassment every day.
The worst part of this crisis is that there is little political will.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, we still don't have that broad mindset, and we're being constrained by every "no-confidence" stance or choice policy change.
Over the last couple of years, I've gotten a lot of advice that I should keep my head down, not talk too much, and that I should have a "everything is fine" mindset.
But I am not here for politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, Thatcher has opposed the government's neglect of an entire schoolroom, and has played a significant role in providing better public service to those in need, whether it be a local councillor or a government minister.
I didn't even vote in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is confused about my differences with my policy stances and current leadership.
The country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect families, businesses, and our public service. Thus, I do not see the need to spend my time and effort to show my sincerity to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But one of the messages to the people of my constituency, whether or not I am not a Nottingham Momentum, but rather a member of the Labour Party, is this: I am proud to serve you, and I believe it is in the best interest of all of you to do what I believe is best.
Chris Leslie is Nottingham East's MP.
AYR 38 - 17 Merlos: Undefeated AYR leads
A couple of late attempts seem to have had an impact on the final result. however, there is no doubt that AYR deserves an unprecedented victory in the spectacularly entertaining Premiership Day match of Tennant.
They were the only ones who didn't make it to the finals.
In the end, it was his extreme defensiveness and the chance to please Home Side and coach Peter Murchie at every level that made him a success.
"We have not been beaten even though we have played so far, which makes me happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose says: "Congratulations to AYR, they've taken a better chance than us."
Frazier Climo conjured Grant Anderson's 14th-minute effort, sending him back AYR. However, Scotland captain Rory Hughes turned the game over to Yellow Card Warrior, and allowed Melrose to do the numbers, and Jason Baggett took the unconverted tri.
Climo went on to fine AYR, before the interval he did a conversant solo tri to make 17-5 for AYR by the time of break.
However, Melrose got off to a good start after the interval, and Patrick Anderson Tri reduced the five-point gap by bagging a convertible.
After playing for too long, Raurid Knott was injured and was stretch-offed, and on re-starting, Clymo Conjured Stafford McDowell won the AYR lead through the tri.
AYR's acting captain, Blair McPherson, was then given a yellow card and, again under tremendous pressure, Melrose was forced to pay extra for the unconverted trial of Bruce Calvin.
When Struan was carded by Yellow to Hutchinson to catch Clemson without the ball, McPherson returned home from the penalty line and prevented AYR from taking the lead.
Climo had been converging on David Armstrong's box kick with Kyle Rowe when he sent Greer Henry to Flanker for the home side's five-trick comeback.
Still Game Star is looking forward to a new opportunity in the restaurant industry
After learning that he has been named as a director in a licensed restaurant company, Still Game star Fort Kieran is looking forward to stepping into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old, who plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, wrote the screenplay and co-starred with long-time comedy co-star Greg Hemphill.
The pair have already announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last, and it looks like Kiernan is thinking about his life after Kreuglung.
As per the official record listing, he is the Director of Adreft Morn Ltd.
Although Scottish Sun sources said he wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "throwing restaurant trade," the actor declined to comment on the news.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
The Navy has its headquarters in La Paz.
The sea-blue flag is flying over government buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are committed to the motto: "The right of the sea is ours."
It is our duty to take it back."
In the 19th century, the island of Bolivia ceded its coast to Chile. Thus, Bolivia’s desire to sail in the Pacific Ocean still prevails.
Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice to deliver its ruling on October 1, after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia has a spirit and mission of integrity and, therefore, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Kalzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Bolivians across the country watch the ICJ ruling on big screens. Bolivia hoped that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of negotiations, would deliver a verdict that Chile should negotiate a transfer of maritime authority to Bolivia.
Bolivia's popular president, Evo Morales, who is seeking re-election amid a controversial campaign next year, also has high hopes for Monday's decision.
"We are in the process of retaking the Pacific Ocean," he said last August.
However, according to some analysts, the court in favor of Bolivia is unlikely to make a decision, and even if the court does, the change is likely to be minimal.
The U.N. Security Council in the Netherlands does not have the authority to decide on Chilean territory and the outcome of potential talks is unpredictable.
Six months after the conclusion of the ICJ's hearing, Chile Paz Zarate, an expert on international law, said the case was "not complicated."
In the last four years, the situation in Bolivia has been seen as uncompromising.
"The Bolivian government has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
She says that Morales's statements have lost her respect for what is left of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate in a context, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltje, has rejected the court's decision-making process as suspicious.
"Tomorrow's verdict will give us an opportunity to forge a new relationship with Chile and put an end to 139 years of mutual dissension," he said.
Callzadilla denies that Morales, a popular president of Latin America, is using the issue of the sea for politics.
"We will never give up the opportunity Bolivia has access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"This judgment is an opportunity to correct past events."
North Korea can't be trusted with nuclear weapons.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yang has said that the country will never be able to destroy a nuclear weapon that we have never trusted in Washington before.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow through on the commitments made by the leaders of the two countries during their meeting in Singapore.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he expects to resume nuclear diplomacy three months after talks with North Korea's Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
He added that North Korea's decision to go to war with the United States is only a matter of time.
Pangong Tso is not the first to denuclearize and Washington has been wary of announcing a deal.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump have called for a second meeting.
However, it is widely believed that the Pangong Tso wants only weapons for its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
You're on your way to the Paris Fashion Show.
If you want to change your hat collection or prevent sunburn, don't look back.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled their uniquely large collection of SS19 in an attractive style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The most bizarre hats were popular on Instagram this summer and were found on the Catwalk, in the eyes of the designers.
Valentino has designed a topcoat with a broad wing-like circumference that beautifies the heads of the models.
Other large size accessories include decorative melons, lizard hats, and pineapples. However, they are not designed to keep your head warm.
In addition to this, Tom Browne also unveiled a selection of strange masks during the Halloween season.
There are many eye-catching masks that have their lips sewn and look more like a Hannibal lectern than a hot-coacher.
One is like a creation and a scuba diving gear, with snorkels and glasses. The other is like a melt-in-the-glass ice cream cone.
If you're a fan of fashion, you can find it here.
It's the kind of thing that will get you off the street with high heels.
Big hats are like La Bomba. A two-foot-wide brim-shaped straw hat can be seen on everyone's head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The non-experimental cult label hat has made a splash on social media and has also made its way to the Catwalk.
Burnt Orange includes Raffia Bag Raffia Fringing and has white leather handles. At Paris Fashion Week, it is a unique product of Jacques La Riviera SS19 Collection.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells Femme: I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive on High Street by next summer. Designers have made a huge impact, and the demand for large-size accessories cannot be ignored.
John Edwards: Global citizens need language skills
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence and in 2018 it was joined by another set of test results, empowering it through personal and cumulative success in sports, art, music and other community situations.
These schools, with an enrollment of 30,000 children, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide the best quality of service to their children and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare children for higher education, the careers they have chosen, and to grow up to be global citizens.
In the academic field of designing and implementing school curriculums, we may note that modern languages are constantly becoming popular and are a subject of demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head."
If you talk to a man in his own language, it goes to his heart.
It reminds us that when we want to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries, we should not be dependent on English alone.
From the results of the recent examination this year, we can note that languages with the highest pass rate in independent schools have taken the top spot.
68% of children who have studied a foreign language have achieved a high grade A.
According to data collected from 74 member schools of the SCIS, 72 per cent of the Mandarin-speaking students scored A higher, 72 per cent of German, 69 per cent of French-speaking students and 63 per cent of Spanish-speaking students scored A higher.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland encourage children and young people to learn a foreign language, without doubt the most important skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now treated as subjects of choice in the independent school curriculum and elsewhere as subjects of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the workforce in the UK lacks language skills.
Thus, more language skills are essential for young people to build their careers.
The need for language skills is one of the most pressing needs in the world.
Regardless of the profession, if someone chooses to learn a second language, they will have the real advantage of having this type of life-long skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will naturally put the person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of respondents could not speak a foreign language while having a conversation, and only 15% spoke French.
That's why it's so important to invest in education today.
If there are many languages in the developing world, it provides a good opportunity for children to find good employment.
Each school in Scotland teaches a different language.
While many schools focus on the classical modern language, 2020 will be observed, while other schools teach the most important languages to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there are always many languages to choose from in independent schools, and this includes specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are special in providing a learning environment and no matter what the future may hold, they will build an environment that fosters the skills and prepares children for success.
There is no denying that language continues to be one of the most important factors in the global business environment, and therefore, it needs to be reflected in education as well.
Of course, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity, and expertise to Scotland's young people.
This is a necessary step.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Lebron to play for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James's first game in Los Angeles is over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season opener against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we still have to decide how long they will play.
"It's probably more than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudel, a Lakers reporter, tweeted that James could play for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked what he planned for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need preseason games to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
US President Donald Trump has begun his campaign in West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, and will be in places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following his choice to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, Trump now intends to seek support in Congress as Republicans risk losing control of the House when mid-term elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling Rally time is 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online via a live stream on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to propose a Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh trial at a rally this week, which is likely to delay Senate vote confirmation for FBI investigators investigating sexual misconduct.
The primary focus of these rallies, however, has been to encourage Republicans in the November election.
The five rallies next week are intended to encourage volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the plurality of Republicans in the Senate and Parliament.
"As regulation of Parliament is central to his agenda, Trump wants to enter as many states as possible so he can be very busy this campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
The rally, scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, "can also invite supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from Pittsburgh Media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump is visiting West Virginia for the second time in a month, winning the state in 2016 by more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey.
"It's not a good idea for Mr. Trump to come to the polls to encourage him," Simon Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
World Cup 2018: Team USA will play their first match of the tournament on Sunday
After three converging sessions, the quadrilateral on Saturday afternoon was a necessity for the Ryder Cup.
The situation, such as the flipping pendulum, completely changed the sport, but it was the competition that the athletes truly believed and competed in.
So, where's the wind blowing now?
“He was six points ahead, but now it’s down to four, so we’re a little ahead,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe are four points clear, with 12 still to go.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that the wind is low and that they need to be encouraged by a lot of things. Spieth and Justin Thomas have been all day, and each has dropped four to three points.
Today's game is against Green Bay and it's a good example.
The celebratory shouts were heard as they walked around. they and Thomas were reduced to two, and the match moved to a more complex stage in all four rounds.
His putt was followed by a similar shoutout as he won Match 15, indicating that the US team was not out.
"It shows that you're more concerned about your match," Spieth said.
That's why all the players are gone.
There are 18 steps to complete.
The only players to score more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but favorite pair of Europeans are in the top four and they can do no wrong.
The only pair that didn't do a bogey shot on Saturday afternoon was Mollywood, who put the bogey away on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and returned on Friday morning at nine.
That run and the energy they have are a sign that Sunday players are going to win the game, and people are supporting it. At Le Golf National, it's clear that Europe will win more than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down.
at different times in different places.
We are not talking about Europe anymore.
The morning's four-ball hero Sergio Garcia's short work was done by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson when he played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles at the front nine encouraged the Spaniard and Sweden to the hole as they could never achieve.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It is very attractive to see four-balls and foursomes because the interplay of the pair and the advice they give and the advice they don’t give and the changing strategy are important.
Europe played well as a team and took a significant lead on the final day. however, this four-season session also showed that the State site is capable of making a questionable fight.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe took a healthy lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead against the United States at Four Balls and Foursome on Saturday.
Encouraged by the pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, Tiger Woods have won two matches to equal the tally and have reached four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn's European is trying to regain the title he lost at Hazeltine two years ago. The series is 3-1 as the United States made a miss fire in the morning four ball.
They displayed more resistance at the US Foursome and won two matches, but were unable to fill the gap.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles match to hold on to the trophy.
Known as Maliwood, Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four points in a row, making him the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup after he and Molinari to win four points in the first four matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four Balls, an even more impressive 5-4 win over American rookie Bryson DeChambeau and Woods.
Woods, who lost two matches on Saturday, has been playing regularly as an expert. however, he has lost 19 of 29 matches at Four Balls and Foursomes and has lost seven in a row.
Resting in the morning Four Balls, Justin Rose teamed up with Henrik Stenson at Foursome to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1 and are ranked 1st and 3rd in the world.
It wasn't easy for Europe, and they lost in the Paris South West.
Leading Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three times, set a milestone for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
He defeated John Ram and Lan Poulter of Spain 2-1 at Foreballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McCall Roy 4-3 at Four Sammons after losing the opening two holes.
In the Ryder Cup, they have scored just two points in four matches, while Furyk has one draw to maintain the trophy.
After being the second favorite in two days, every Sunday attack seems to be more of this.
North Korea says it will not destroy its nuclear weapons for no reason.
North Korea's foreign minister said at the United Nations on Saturday that the ban had eroded its trust in the United Nations and that it could not voluntarily destroy its nuclear arsenal in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual session of the United Nations that North Korea had taken a number of "good steps" in the past years, including halting nuclear and missile tests, halting nuclear test sites, and even a pledge to halt nuclear and nuclear technology.
"We have not received any response from the United States," he said.
"If we have no trust in the United States, no confidence in our national security will arise and we will not voluntarily destroy our nuclear weapons first."
Washington's criticism of Washington's opposition to North Korea's proposal to phase out nuclear weapons has been significant, as has been the case in the past.
Referring to a joint statement issued by current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, Ri said that Kim had pledged to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and that the US was committed to the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. demands that Pyongyang first destroy its nuclear weapons.
The United States has refused to lift a tough international ban on North Korea.
"The United States is first encouraging the destruction of nuclear weapons, but increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal, and also objecting to an end to the war," he said.
"People who don't know about us dream about us because of prohibition.
But the problem is that the bans continue to increase the confidence gap between us."
Ri made no mention of a second meeting between Kim and Trump, as cited by US leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
Referring to the three summits between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, the minister said: "If the US had not played a key role in the denuclearization proposal, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a critical stage."
However, this year's speech was completely different from last year's speech at the United Nations when Trump called Kim a "rocket man" who was about to commit suicide after North Korea fired its rockets at the United States.
Trump, who last year said he would "totally destroy" North Korea, said at the United Nations this year he admired Kim's courage in destroying a nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a timetable for the deal, adding: "Let it take two years, three years, or five years, it's not a problem."
China and Russia have been arguing that Pyongyang should be awarded the United Nations Security Council for its actions.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "Totally, finally, we must continue to enforce Security Council sanctions vigorously until we learn of the denuclearization that has been reviewed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but this last trip did not go well for him.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, as he was condemned for placing "pirate-like demands" on North Korea within hours.
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon that it would dismantle the missile site and the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate steps."
In addition to the security assurances Trump said in Singapore, Kim said he had been briefed on the "concrete measures" he was looking forward to and was interested in pursuing a good relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University is starting this year to combat the growing Macho culture in studies among undergraduates who fall asleep so much due to caffeine-fueled "all-nighters."
Students who are educated at the best university in the world may not have a basic understanding of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Seissler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and specialist at a women's hospital, and is believed to be the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to do this course after speaking about the negative effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it a girl asked me: 'After all these years, why is this being said to me when I am a senior student?'
"I'm surprised no one has ever told me about it," she said.
This course, which was implemented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can help them achieve academic and sports achievements, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after seeing students deprived of sleep for a week.
Long-term courses include interactive activities.
In one section there is a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee blacks, screens, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insomnia affects sports and the importance of bedtime.
In another section, it is said how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the premises, with interactive signs, encourages participants to think about the routine.
"""We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students."
We believe that just as you have the right to know the consequences of your choice to smoke, you also have the right to know about sleep.
While a culture that takes pride in staying up all night reading still exists, insomnia is a growing problem due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students.
A good quality sleep should be the 'secret weapon' to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, helping to avoid weight gain as well as keeping the sleep deprived brain hungry so that it is constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Seesler design the course and took one of his classes in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to start courses across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same study program before enrolling in a competing institution.
Students should set an alarm for when to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'bluelights' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights. These lights will emit your circadian rhythm from the kilt, thus causing a sleep problem, Professor Seesler recommends.
Livingston Rangers 1-0: Guerrero's men's team
Steven Gerrard's Rangers continued their losing streak with another 1-0 defeat to Dal<0xC3><0xAD> Menga at Livingston.
The Ibrox were trying to record their first win since their February 4-1 victory at St John's, but Gary Holt's team made it Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, losing eight points to the Lad Bourkes Premiership captain Harts, who left his team.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the unmotivated Rangers could not find the equaliser at any point.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third and is only behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
Callum Spence, the line-man, has suffered a head injury after being hit by something thrown from a distance and is undergoing treatment.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that led Aire to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, retained the same Livy 11 from Hearts last week and was delighted to see their well-prepared team take on their opponents every step of the way.
Although the Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston did most of the scoring.
When Menga sent his first-ever lay-off Scott Pitman through Alan McGregor's goal he had to score just two minutes but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs got Skipper Craig Holtke after a free-kick but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was just hitting in the previous post.
Although the Rangers have maintained control, they are looking more confident than confident in their final third game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that a quarter-hour mark penalty should be imposed because of the conflict between him and Steven Lawless, but the judge, Steven Thomson, did not consider Columbia's pleas.
The Rangers only had two first-half shots on target but Fourmer was hampered by Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's header from Lassana Coulibaly and Ove Ezaria Strike.
Livia's 34th minute opener may be against the run of play, but no one can stop him.
The Rangers once again failed to counter Jacob's deep set-piece.
Scott Orfield didn't respond when Declan Gallaher slotted the ball into Scott Robinson, who was waiting for him to pick Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard changed Cowley's for Ryan Kent during the break and this was immediately affected by the fact that the winger had a slot on Morelos but an impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to play the game that viewers loved with the big big shots with Lithgow and Halket
Holt could have taken the lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up to deny Jacob even before he was wide-eyed from Lithgow's corner.
The Rangers' replacement player Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim from a dispute with Jacob but again Thompson backed away.
Panchangam: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and counting ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually became known as the Geiger Counter.
Since then the Gaiger counter, the main basis of science, has also become the basis of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring Cowpok scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter that is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can really hear the effects of the molecules emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, are you really swimming?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
This innovation has earned its name.
A new cancer vaccine may boost the immune system of the C-Rich cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'see' sick cells and destroys them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system identify the puerperal cells
This procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the lab.
They can then reinject the C-type protein into the bloodstream, which is responsible for many cancers.
The experimental vaccine is showing promising results in cancer patients.
A woman who received vaccine therapy that taught the immune system to recognize the rhizomes has seen her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
This procedure involves extracting immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the lab so they can give the "sea" normal protein to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjected.
"Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: ""The results show that we have found the most promising vaccine."
Jay Berzofsky explained that HER2 "leads to the progression of several cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
Learning to take immune cells from patients and target them with cancer cells has helped treat a type of leukemia.
SNL backs Trump from Kanye West wearing a mega hat.
It wasn't good.
Kanye West was booed by an audience for praising US President Donald Trump during a live broadcast on Saturday night and saying he would run for reelection in 2020.
After performing his third song last night, he wore a Make America Great Cap in Ghost Town, mocking the Democrat and expressing his support for Trump.
"""When I spoke to white people, they asked me a lot of times, 'Why do you like Trump, he's not a racist?'"""
If I was concerned about racism, I would have left America, he said.
SNL began with Matt Damon's skit, in which he ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is investigating allegations of sexual assault made by Hollywood star Christine Blasey Ford.
Comedian Chris Rock uploaded a funny video of West on social media even though it was not broadcast.
It's not clear whether West tried to mock him rock by posting.
He also said it's hard for him to get a grip on the West Coast.
"""They pushed me in front of the camera."
"Don't wear a hat," he said.
He's pissed at me!
I am not in a good state of mind, he told the Washington Examiner.
"And West said: ""Do you want to go on stage in the same mood?"" He said: ""You can't tell me whether to wear this Superman cap or not. I asked if you want me to go on. I said, 'Where do you want me to go?'"""
"Love it."""
His comments were at least twice criticised by the audience and embarrassed SNL cast members. according to Variety, one of the cast members said: 'The whole studio went silent.'
West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
The West surprised many with his I Love It song, which he wore as a Periyar bottle.
A conservative group called TPUSA supported West. Cadence Turner's tweet read: 'For brave souls: Thank you for performing at the group level.'
But Karen Hunter tweeted: "Simply put, West was as good as he was".
"""But I don't believe in supporting someone who says idealism that is harmful to my community (buying their music or cloaking or supporting their art)."
They are free.
So are we, he said.
Prior to the show, Rapper announced on Twitter that she had changed her name and now officially known as Cayenne West.
Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy, or P Diddy were not the first to change their names.
The other rapper's name was Snoop Leon. the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later returned to the former name Prince.

Game of thrones star kit harrington against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the sword-wielding John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fictional series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has slammed the concept of 'Macho Hero' and said that due to such on-screen characters, boys often face the prospect of feeling that they will get respect only if they are strong in mind.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said, I feel something is wrong. In todays <0x23>MeToo era, there is a need to take action against toxic masculinity.
A co-star of his Game of Thrones series, Kit, who is married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, said he had no intention of expressing the matter.
He also said that he personally felt strongly about this, but did something go wrong with the manhood?
'What do we teach men when they grow up? Does this have anything to do with the problems we see today?'
Television is the reason why toxic masculinity has grown to this level, he said.
He went on to say: "What is motivation and teaching?
What do you think about the idea that young people should be allowed to watch TV in their homes?
I feel this is one of the biggest questions of our time. How can we change this?
There’s something really wrong with the kids.”
In an interview, he said that he will not bother about any Game of Thrones drama when the sequel comes out next summer.
From November, Kit will play the role of Sam Shepherd in the sequel to True West. The story is the story of a film producer and his gangster brother.
He said he wanted to meet his wife, Rose, to get out of Game of Thrones.
"""I met my wife on this show, so in this way it provided me with my future family. from here my life took a different turn,"" she said."
Rosekitt's character, John Snow, was a vigrit of romantic interest. this fantasy series won an Emmy Award.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate
China's HIV/AIDS cases rise by 14%
China has seen a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected with AIDS.
More than 40,000 cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of cases are caused by sexual contact.
Traditionally, the reason for the rapid spread of HIV in China was blood transfusions.
Chinese health officials in Yunnan state said that the flow of aids in this way has been almost zero.
In China, the number of people living with HIV has increased by 100,000 every year.
In China's LGBT community, HIV spread through sexual contact is a severe problem.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination still exists among the LGBT community.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
These diseases are caused by the lack of appropriate protective measures.
To address this problem, China has provided comprehensive access to HIV medicine since 2003.
Maxine Waters has accused the GOP Senators of "dangerous lies" and "assault on the device."
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday slammed allegations that one of her staffers posted the personal information of three Republican senators and lawmakers on Wikipedia pages.
He said that the right-wing pundits and websites are spreading misinformation about this.
"Waters said in a statement on Twitter that ""lies, lies, and even more heinous lies""."
The data released reportedly included the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators. Lindsay Graham and Mike Lee and Arin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, when an unknown man posted it on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh.
The matter was leaked shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites Gateway Pandit and Red State reported that IP addresses were the source of the posts and Waters staff members may have published them.
"""This anonymous allegation is completely false and malicious,"" Waters said."
"""My staff members, their identity, security are exposed through these fraud and false allegations and I am not responsible in any way for the leak,"" he said."
"""This allegation is completely false and baseless,"" he said."
Waters's remarks immediately drew online criticism, with former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer being one of those criticized.
This denial is infuriating, Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that Waters is not eligible to become a member of Congress.
There is no need for anyone to make false accusations.
They shouldnt be so scared.
There is no need to say that the accused is mischievous.
They should be calm and patient.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Justice Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh appeared to be furious by Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the midterm elections, shared his thoughts on Twitter.
This is big news indeed, he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that he had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about the claims.
"""Who is behind this conspiracy will be revealed,"" Waters said, adding, ""To my staff, those who have taken destructive and dangerous actions will be held legally accountable for their actions."""
Johnny English Strikes Again, directed by Rowan Atkinson
Johnny English Strikes Again Review <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Suppe Rowan Atkinson Spy is a British cinematic classic, with no significant stakes in Brexit. It also extends to the comedy Johnny English series. The Johnny English series, which began in 2003, was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a self- satire on the fact that we have certainly done poorly as a nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English, an incapacitated pop-eye, rubber face, is licensed to update his facts for a second time - a name which, above all, he claims to have designed for non-English speaking cinema.
He is also a daft secret agent who, despite his eccentric pretenses towards Glamour, has been somewhat of a dick, contributing to Mr. Bean's rage and a note on Charities of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He's basically an international figure of the secret actinson who appears in the now-forgotten Bark Clacard TV commercials, which he confuses people with his rise.
There are one or two happy moments in this recent JE trip.
As I was approaching the Johnny English helicopter, I really liked to see the medieval-era suit he was wearing and the rotor blade swirling around him.
Atkinson, who was gifted with a sense of humor through physical gestures, was now performing, but the humor seemed powerless and eccentric, especially when compared to "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible, which now accurately contribute to the humor as a part of the plot.
The humor in it seems to be more aimed at children than at adults, and I felt that Johnny English's wacky misadventures were not creative and focused and focused on Bean's personality in the way Atkinson's muted manner.
Today, Britain is in a great deal of trouble.
The cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britains top-secret web network, revealing the identities of all Britains agents in the field, a disappointment to agent officers on duty - a regrettable thing for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and daring man, already suffering a complete meltdown from political notoriety: Emma Thompson does her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since each of the undercover agents has compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
Its main meaning is to baffle Johnny English, now working as a school teacher in some luxury institution, but without documentation on how to operate in secret: some of the best fun of it is to provide a school such as the Rock-Type Academy of English Intelligence.
English is brought back to the White Hall for an explanation of the emergency and merged with a long-suffering side kick bounce, held back by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, beaten up to the Submarine Commander, which features a Jolly-Hockey-Sticks character in which Vicky Pepper Dine is a bit of a waste.
Haggis has made terrible mistakes in Batman and Robin Her Majesty's Secret Service, taking on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulettova.
Moreover, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: Sinister Jason Volta, manned by Jack Lacey.
English and Bau begin their act of satirical high-jinks when they set a French restaurant on fire in the guise of waitresses; they are smuggled aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and they incite English pure anarchy to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's home.
All the stops in that last sequence are definitely taken out, but it is friendly and lively. Even today there are a lot of kids who like to watch it on TV.
It is quite a thing.
And I couldn't think like other Johnny English films: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson his talent for really doing a justice-doing role?
The UK government is working on a four-day work week, which will be paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would require Britons to work four days a week - but to be paid five days a week.
The party wants the company bosses to pass on the savings made through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the employees by giving them an extra day off.
This will see employees enjoy a three-day-week-end - yet take home the same amount of pay.
"The idea ""fits"" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country around in favour of workers, sources said."
The Trades Union Congress has approved changes to the four-day week to allow workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party chief told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'Such an act does not happen overnight but the four-day work week is the party's approach to balancing the economy on behalf of the workers and the aspiration which is consistent with the party's overall industrial strategy.'
Since the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea.
However, this ambition is not fully endorsed by the current Labour Party.
As one Labour Party member put it: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.’
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell held a labor conference last week that worked hard to bring out the vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he has decided to take back the powers of 'faceless directors' and 'beneficiaries' in utility firms.
The shadow chancellor plans that current shareholders in water companies may not get back their full shareholding, as the labour government may make 'reductions' based on perceived wrong-doing.
He also ensured plans to create in-house owned funds to include workers on company boards and private sector firms to hand over 10 per cent of the shares to employees, who will put up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in annual dividends in their pocket.
When asked if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change his mind, Lindsey Graham says John Kennedy "60 Minutes."
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions about whether they could motivate any Republican senators to draw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could catch anything that would cause them to change their minds.
The Canadians appeared more open-minded than their fellow South Carolinans.
"Well," said Canada.
"I told him I was going to trial, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called them after this happened, that accusation got out, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, determined, and unwavering."
Graham's decision, however, was as firm as a stone.
"My mind is made up on Brett Kavanaugh and it takes a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied this by referring to Christine Bresley Ford.
None of them were named after him.
He is 36-years-old.
I didn't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what have you done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a show of stars and an equally impressive mission; the world will end poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is being held in Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness about the true goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket for an event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerts had to complete a number of tasks, or volunteer, emailing a world leader, a phone call, or any of the other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has global civilization been, with 12 years to go before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way of convincing people for a call, or is it just another case of so-called "click vision" - assuming people are making a real difference by signing an online application or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, global civilization claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, each with different goals.
These actions have helped inspire world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are worth more than $37 billion, with the goal of impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and publications stemming from its work, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that safe funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world so far.
The Russia-based partnership, which promises to "help raise investors and their children of implementation," will provide $35 million Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the Russian government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
After the Russian government took more than 5,000 steps to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions, the group said.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "How do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The global citizen's answer: "It's a very long and difficult path - sometimes we stumble and fail."
But, we will succeed as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that are before us, because together we will be much more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Card B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA9>e perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy as a "blockade" to impede exports of Russia's energy resources
Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed that Washington will use its internal navy to hide Russian power in markets, including the Middle East, if necessary.
Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular, has been acting at the invitation of a legitimate government - a pretext for exploring new powerful markets.
"The reason they are in the Middle East is because I believe they want to be a middle power in Eastern Europe, a middle power in the southernmost part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"With our Navy, the United States has that capacity to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their power doesn't go to market," he said.
Jinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which he describes as the "voice of consumer power" in the United States.
He went there to compare Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were effectively the same.
"The above economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less to control and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "an ingenious horse" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has replaced Russia with the intention of exporting its liquefied natural gas to Europe, making it a very cheap option for European consumers.
To that effect, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, would try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, was a "captive" of Berlin Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline is just an economic project, ready to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the plan was motivated solely by economic reasons and was an example of dishonest competition.
After a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said: "I believe we share the view that stress cannot be a means of running a supply chain and consumers will be able to choose suppliers."
The U.S. position has suffered a setback from Germany, which has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It was a big problem for me when a third state interfered in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren had "hard work" when she ran for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would face "hard work" after the midterm elections to run for president.
At the Town Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and have a better place with women," she told Hill.
"After November 6, I will work hard to run for president."
Warren pressed President Donald Trump during Town Hall, saying, "He's taking this county in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren has publicly spoken out against Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In Friday's tweet, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents don't think they should compete in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe survey, fifty-eight percent of "probability" Massachusetts voters stated that a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported such a contest.
A poll conducted by former Gov. Deval Patrick showed the most support, with 38 percent holding potential driving and 48 percent supporting it.
Other top Democratic names discussed for 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make a decision by January.
US President Donald Trump calls Track's PTSD out of office
Pauline spent a year in Iraq after joining on September 26.
He was arrested in connection with a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son is doing, what he will do after he comes back, I can relate to other families that are suffering from PTSD and to the families of our soldiers who have been injured and come back," he said.
Palin called her arrest the "elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little differently, they come back with a firm mind, they wonder with respect what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have contributed to the country."
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, allegations of domestic violence against a woman, interference with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in the event of a report of domestic violence and rape, a spokeswoman for the Dus Bennett Vassilla Police Department said.
18 States, D.C.’s support for the new asylum policy is a challenge
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to those fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a brief petition in Washington on Friday to support those who challenge the policy and seek asylum, NBC News reported.
Grace v. Nassy was the full name of the Plaintif. the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She told her partner "and the children of his violent gang members" that she had been abused, but U.S. authorities denied her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Advocates from states that support Grace explained El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala that it creates the largest number of applicants for U.S. asylum, with countries facing widespread problems with robbery and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appellate Council that allowed undocumented immigrants who had not fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"All claims of asylum under federal law must be adjudicated upon the particular facts and circumstances and such listing would be in violation of that principle," the court said.
Lawyers briefly argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
The U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judge to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and mass violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of membership in a race, religion, nationality or particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said of the June 11 policy.
Aslam will never be able to overcome all the problems and even all the serious problems that people around the world face on a daily basis.
The number of deaths in the nation has doubled in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was even worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, comforting a fever-stricken male child at a evacuation center for the city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance is bringing bodies.
The water is very clean."
The image appeared to be of residents returning to their destroyed home, choosing their household items that had been submerged in water, whether they were fit to use anything.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, and hospitals were inundated.
Some of the injured, including Dwai Haris, who was suffering from a back and shoulder fracture, took rest outside the Army Hospital in Palu where patients were being treated outdoors as there was not much space.
He filled his eyes with his wife and children, claiming that the earthquake shook his fifth-floor hotel room.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I'm stuck for the remnants of the wall," Harris told The Associated Press, adding that her family had gone for a wedding and was in town.
"My wife was begging for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I think they're safe."
US envoy accuses China of 'threating' India through propaganda ads
After a four-page ad in a US daily detailing the benefits of China-US trade ties, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US media to achieve its objectives.
US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the paid supplement appeared in Iowa's top-selling newspaper Des Moines Register as an attempt by China to influence the November 6 US Congressional elections.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the US election was part of an effort to pressure China.
It is common for foreign governments to advertise in newspapers to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a trade war and are taking action by raising taxes on goods sold to each other.
Chinese and American manufacturers have said that China has imposed counter-tariffs on American manufacturers in a way that gives a beating to exporters in a state like Iowa, which has backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa's long-time information governor, and a major agricultural exporter to China, said China has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In the Sunday's Des Moines Register, Bradstad wrote, China is now trying to cook up its currency by publishing advertisements in our free newspapers.
"America's tradition of free journalism has allowed China to be cooked up, as evidenced by the advertisement in the Des Moines Register,"" he wrote."
"Contrary to this, if you visit a news stand in Beijing's Gully, you will not find any opinion on the economic woes of China, where the media is held under the thumb of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
"He said he was reluctant to publish my article in one of China's leading newspapers," although he did not name any newspaper.
A look back at the women's suffrage movement in the wake of the Kavanaugh scandal
Analysts have warned that she will face stiff resistance from voters, especially women, in the upcoming midterm elections, as several top Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing several sexual assault charges.
It's a fact of life that a majority of Republicans are willing to vote for.
We can't go back on those things," Grant Reicher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said in an article published on Saturday.
Senator Jeff Fleck said he had doubts about whether the FBI's last-minute attempt to investigate would be enough to anger angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - whether it's tomorrow or November, they can't forget it," Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser at MoveOn, a progressive group, and national spokesperson, told the Washington D.C. daily on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters staged a demonstration in the Senate's hallway with the slogan "November is coming!". However, Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is unprecedented," a non-partisan political analyst told the Stuttgart news site.
"People are saying that it's true.
But this may be high, particularly for women changing parties in suburban areas and young voters aged 18-29, who don't like the president as much as those who don't vote at all."
Even before Ford made a public statement about the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said Republicans may have to face stiff resistance from the public in the future to pursue the nomination.
Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in the first half of last week that it was "complicated to the extent of the GOP."
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about how Republicans handled the issue and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told a news channel.
Americans are a little confused about Ford and Cavanaugh's statements, most of them in favor of Ford.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of people believe what Ford said, while 35 per cent believe what Cavanaugh said.
In addition, 38 percent of people believe Cavanaugh lied during his trial, compared with 30 percent of those who think Ford lied.
The FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, including several other charges against Kavanaugh, another woman named Deborah Ramirez.
Ford has accused the Senate Judiciary Committee of sexually assaulting him when he was 17.
Ramirez has been accused of displaying his penis while attending a party in the 1980s when they were both studying at Yale.
The world wide web search engine for Google and Facebook
World Wide Web searcher Tim Berners-Lee is set to launch a new startup to hit Google, Facebook and Amazon.
Lee's new project, Infrapt, is building a solid, open-source platform.
Through Solid, users are able to control where data is stored and who can read what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Inr<0xC3><0xAA>t joked that the motive behind Inr<0xC3><0xAA>t's "rule the world" was Berners-Lee.
"Let's get started," he said.
"This is a historic occasion."
People can create their own "personal online data store or pod" using Solid technology.
This includes providing contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It works like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. Everything is available here in the same browser at the same time.
One of the most important things about online shopping is that it's completely up to the user.
"The company called it ""personal empowerment through data""."
According to company CEO John Bruce, Infrapt's vision is to provide the company with the resources, methods, and skills needed to make the solid available to everyone.
The company currently has a community of developer staff and voluntary coders hired to work on the project, a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Infrapter website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team had "suddenly avoided talking to Facebook and Google about introducing a way to transform all of their businesses."
We don't need their permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee said, "Infrapt's purpose is to build a commercial force and work environment that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new web to be built on solids."
He revolutionized the Internet in 1994 with his invention of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been one of the most influential voices in the Net Neutrality debate in recent months.
Berners-Lee will continue as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said he is optimistic about the future of the Internet.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The priest, who received the Victoria Cross as a soldier in the First World War, was commemorated in his birthplace in the 100th year of his birth.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vane received the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Belanglais and Lehighcourt.
Four days later, however, he was shot in the back of the head from a distance, and he did not live to enjoy receiving the Victoria Cross, the highest military honor.
His grandsons inaugurated the memorial stone on Saturday on the occasion of the expo in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vane, said it was indeed symbolic that the stone was being erected in memory of Victoria 100 years after she received the Cross.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Colonel Vane moved with his battalion to the Canal de St. Quentin. The thick fog had spread and enemy machine guns were resorting to unprovoked firing."
He then displayed great valour on the battlefield, standing on the front line of the fight, single-handedly using the field gun to repel three of his opponents' guns.
Lt. Colonel Vane was shot and killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a month before the end of World War I.
Michael Vane, 72, said, "I cannot repeat what my grandfather achieved in life, but I can be very humble."
After the military parade, he laid the foundation stone with his brother, Dr. James Vane. The event was organised by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said it was "an honor to be here" and that "the valor of the great hero has been heartily supported by many."
MMA fans have been waiting all night for the premiere of Belato 206
Imagine that you stayed awake all night to watch Belato 206 but did not get a chance to attend the main event.
San Jose's bill had a total of 13 fights, including six on the main card and it was shown live throughout the night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonnell were getting ready for a fight.
Some of the people who attended the meeting were angry.
"Talking about the children's cartoon show, a fan on Twitter called it a ""bad joke""."
"As per the government's broadcasting policy, the fight show at 6:00 a.m. was not appropriate and they had to air the children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Communications, Belator.
"Oh, the pig, yes.
The company's president, Scott Coker, said he would also keep UK viewers in mind in the future.
"Maybe it's in my opinion that we can set the replay time in a way that we can move to the UK," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning, but we can't set it up until our Sunday time, which is their Monday time," he said.
However, we are trying to fix it.
Yes, they were angry when we had to stop the transmission, because the message had become a flood of words, and they were all weeping.
We are trying to fix this, we thought it might be a technical problem.
But they are not following the government's advice.
I can assure you that this will not happen again.
We could have made it to five fights instead of six, and we could have made it to five.
This is a sad situation."
Deseret Island discs: Tom Daley downplays sexism
"Olympic diver Tom Daley says, ""It's like they're shy about their sexuality, but that's what motivates them to do it."
By the time he was 24 years old, not everyone knew he was gay.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, she talked about the rights of homosexuality in order to provide hope to others.
He also said that being a child parent has made him less concerned about the Olympics.
Kirsty Yang, who regularly watched the show, was on vacation for several months.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD>, who appeared as Castaway on Laverne's show, said he considered himself inferior to others, but that liking boys and girls was not a natural habit.
He said: "I've had a lot of success so far, whether it's in the past or the future.
He wanted to create an environment where no one could feel anything, even if they knew about their sexuality and wanted to achieve something.
A two-time Olympic bronze-medallist, she became a high-profile LGBT campaigner, this time during the Commonwealth Games in Australia, urging most countries to remove homosexuality from the list of crimes.
He said he enjoys living free and strives to give hope to others.
It was a surprise when she started falling in love with a man in 2013. The man was a US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Deli married Oscar-winning Lance Black, who was 20 years her senior, last year.
"A lot of things happened at a very young age," he said as he reminisced about his first Olympic medal when he was 14 years old, three years after his father died of cancer.
The couple became parents to a son, Robert Ray Black-Daily. Dal<0xC3><0xAD>'s life-style completely changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have talked about winning a gold medal.
"You know, there are bigger things in life than Olympic gold medals.
"Ruby is my Olympic gold medalist.
He named his son Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
According to Daley, his father, Robert, did not want to die. he always asked if he could get a ticket to sit in the front row at the 2012 London Olympics.
“But how can you say you can’t be on the first line,” Daley asks.
"Their breath stopped as I held their hand. I thought they would hold on to life until their breath stopped. But once death was confirmed, it became clear that they would not live forever."
The next year, Deli won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"All my life, I've dreamed about it. I'm going to dive in front of my country's spectators at the Olympic Games. There's no greater joy than winning a medal there."
This was also the inspiration for her first song selection, Heather Small's Proud, a song that not only resonated during the preparations for the Olympics, but was also filled with excitement.
Desert Island Discs Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Saturday's loss to the Red Sox
American Phil Mickelson was scheduled to play his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to return to the rhythm if he is to achieve the milestone.
Michaelson, who is participating in a record 12th biennial tournament, was rested at Saturday's Four Balls and Four Sums by team captain Jim Furyk.
A prolific United States player as well as a rider's cup runner, he spent his days as a four-time major winner cheerleader and focused on improving his game.
The 48-year-old player, who did not know exactly what he was doing at the peak of his career, was not ideal for the National Course.
Although the course is not that challenging, Michaelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match. He has won all four of his matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
Michaelson's match will be a key one for Americans who are four points short of starting 12 singles matches.
He had nothing but confidence in his team-mate.
"They fully understood what their role was today, using my back and their arms around me to tell me they're ready for tomorrow's match," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He was a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past.
I don't think he played just two games.
I thought I could have won more. But it happened the way it happened. We thought it was the right decision.
They all want to be here."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This marks the end of Ryder Cup career that does not match the height of his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, though Furyk said his presence has brought some ambiguities to the team.
"He's funny, ironic, witty, likes to make fun of people, and he's the best guy on our team," he explained.
The younger players were having a lot of fun going to them, as well as this week, I think it's a lot of fun to watch.
They give more than just a game.
Europe's leader, Thomas Bjorne, has said that a large-scale lead will soon disappear.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a major lead in a singles match on the last day of a Ryder Cup tournament can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team had scored five points over the Americans under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros but only got the final line to his nose in front with narrow margins, a win in a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x80><0x93>131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 margin.
"After watching the 2018 Class 5-3 win on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at the League Golf National Games, you'll remember that we took a big lead at Valderrama; we took a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, not only," Bjorn said.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Tomorrow is going to be hard for everyone.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It won't be over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will remain.
I have said it everywhere, I focus on the 12 players in my team, but we know very well what is on the other side the top players in the world.
Jorne said he was happy to see how his players performed on the tough golf course: I will not let this continue.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow is another day and there will be more to come.
It's good to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're out separately, your ability as a golfer is tested to the fullest.
You need to get in touch with the players, the message is that you will get better results from you tomorrow.
Let your friends go and let them go and hope for the best."
In contrast to Bjorne, opponent number Jim Furyk is performing better than he did as a partner, apart from Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was at the end of both phases of that last transaction, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before Europe ended up losing out to "Madina at Medina."
"When Ben Crenshaw, who was captain in 1999, was asked how he got his players together for the last day, I remember every single bad word of it," he said.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you see at Brookline as you see at Medina.
When fast that way, it puts a lot of pressure on those mid-games.
We'll set up our line-up accordingly and you know the guys will be tamed in the style we think, we're going to try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the upper half of the order along with other Europeans.
"I went with this group of guys in this order, because I think that's going to cover it all," Bjorn said of their singles selections.
The German warship was attacked again.
The German Navy's new fleet was to be deployed in 2014 to replace Cold War-era battleships, but local media reported that it would not be able to do so until next year due to faulty systems and snowball costs.
According to a military spokesman, the flagship ship of the brand new Baden-Wuenburg-class frigates "Rainland-Falz" has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but some issues post-delivery ruined the future of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered back in 2007 will be replaced by Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to include a range of powerful artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some covert technologies such as low radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other key features include longer maintenance periods <0xE2><0x80><0x93> it is possible to deploy new warships from major local ports for two years.
However, due to the constant delays of sophisticated warships - which are said to allow Germany to plan electricity abroad - Direct says they will already be old by the time they enter service.
Unfortunately, the F125 refused to be retained as the German Navy's official ship last year and made the news by returning it to the Bloham and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the ship has been returned to the shipyard.
The reason for the return was very little known, but the German media noted that there were several critical factors in the "software and hardware shortages" that would render the battleship useless if deployed in combat.
The Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg range of ships is managed by about 120 Navy sailors and the software shortages may have a major impact - half the manpower as compared to the older Bremen range of warships.
Also, the ship is overweight and it will reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rainland-Falz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the equivalent-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have initially reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
These difficulties are particularly significant in terms of getting new warships under the latest warnings that naval power in Germany is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy was in fact "going out of commission-capable ships."
The official said that the problem grew like a snowball over time, as older ships were scrapped but replacement ships were not provided.
He regretted that no member of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class could rejoin the fleet.
The National Trust's take on the secret life of bats
New discoveries are underway in the estate of the Scottish Highlands, aiming to reveal how bats use land for their hunting for food.
Research on the behavior of unique flying mammals is believed to provide new light and guide future conservation activities.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland followed common and soprano pipestrels, including brown long ears and doubenton bats.
Special recorders will be placed at prominent places of their movement to track the activities of bats at all seasons.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting surveys on mobile phones using hand-held detectors.
The voice analysis of experts due to all the recordings confirms the frequency of the bats' cries and what species are doing.
A habitat map and report are prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are more important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information can help determine the benefits of a habitat management function, such as grassland creation, and better know how to manage woodlands for bats and other related species.
The population of bats throughout Scotland and the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are endangered by building and development works, which affect poultry and habitat loss.
Certain chemical substances in flypapers and building materials can cause damage, as can air turbines and lighting hazards on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, when it comes to hunting at night because it is their habit, their ears help more than their eyes.
They use a state-of-the-art echo-location technique to identify bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS is responsible for overseeing more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
It has ten trained experts who are constantly conducting surveys, inspecting and sometimes protecting it.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only reserve of bats for conservation at Dumfries and Thrive Estate in Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species are housed.
The estate is a suitable area for him, according to the estate's manager, David Thompson.
"We have a good area for bats in the trivet," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and all good habitats.
But we don't know enough about bats, so we're working here and in other places to help them understand more about what they need to do to thrive."
He stressed on the importance of screening bats before conducting location management, as 400 female species and younger generations have been wiped out without adequate maternal protection, possibly resulting in an entire population being wiped out.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their progeny.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish officer of the Bats Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
As they say: "We still need to know about our bats and many of our generations don't know how their population is moving."
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of sexual assault by a German lawyer
Cristiano Ronaldo has identified the claim of rape against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is set to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was accused of paying $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, spoke to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video, calling them "fake news."
"All of this, no.
He said today, "Fake news," a five-time Blaine Devor Winner said in front of the camera.
"They are using my name to promote themselves.
This is normal.
They're using my name to become famous, but that's part of the job.
"I'm very happy and everything is fine," he added.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel, which he called an "inadmissible report on suspicions in the privacy area."
The Christian Skirts player is seeking "compensation for moral damages in proportion to the amount of the breach, one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, according to papers filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room and reported that they had raped her.
After the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his feet and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy."
The records say that Ronaldo has confirmed that the pair had sex, but that's all agreed.
Mayogra went to the police and gave them photos of herself taken at the hospital, but later admitted to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to overturn the settlement as she has been traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and had agreed to a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract with Italian giants Juve this summer.
Brexit: The UK has always regretted the loss of the carmaker
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK "will forever regret" its loss of its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border delay of the Brexit event without any deal could cost jobs.
The Bernaston plant, which makes Toyota's Yaris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain is hit by the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without any deal on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its mini-plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The car manufacturers' problem is that in the absence of a deal in Brexit, supply chain-related issues are at risk.
Toyota's production line will be driven on a "just-in-time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
The industry says that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border due to delays and lack of spare parts.
The company said it was "impossible" for Toyota to keep a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, thus halting production.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's checkers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks across the border."
"We just want to have the best business we can allow, as I say, to enjoy the current success," he told today's program on BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must be fully able to continue the most successful supply chains."
It is not possible to say for how long Toyota will stop production, but in the long run, additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and will ultimately affect the jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked at Bernaston for 24 years and was United Union Convener at the plant, said his members were most concerned: "My experience has been that once these jobs are lost, there is no coming back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again: White House
As the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, Donald Trump said on Sunday that a high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be pushed back another week."
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating links between Trump aides and Russia and obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump is out to get the deputy attorney general and threaten Mueller's freedom is up for debate.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment to record his conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he also went to the White House on Monday amid speculations that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the then United Nations in New York was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "doesn't give priority" to firing Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual abuse, put forward both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting, Rosenstein said: "No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I can see myself pushing back another week after giving all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we see it and I always want to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chrissy Teigen asked why.
According to Sanders, the reason for not holding a press conference was not a lack of desire for attention, but rather, he said: "I don't agree with what they point out."
He then suggested that there would be more direct contact between Trump and the newspaper.
"The president makes more Q&A sessions than any other president has," he said, without citing evidence.
The briefings still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me."
We try to do that a lot, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and when you talk to the president of the United States, it's going to be at a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Newspapers are very rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated, perhaps freewheeling and sometimes eccentric, with reporters.
Health Secretary writes on Brexit concerns for EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland expressing their gratitude for the country and their desire to be in the post-Brexit position.
Jean Freeman sent the MSP a letter of less than six months until the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its improved public services.
In her letters, Ms. Freeman wrote: "After the summer is over, the negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continue, moving towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is ramping up its preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is not a good time for all of you.
That's why I want to mesmerize you with how much I respect the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
The invaluable experience and skills in strengthening and improving the health care work will benefit colleagues in the EU and beyond, as well as the patients and communities we serve.
It's your home and we want you to be here.
Kristen Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Aber Crombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury following his 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"They came to the party, what kind of collapse," Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen before putting him on a stretcher and turning him back for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abeer had been ruled out of undergoing surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "there are still no details on the extent of the injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Harris "has no further details on the type/ extent of the injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK with the extra money used to help the homeless.
The move will neutralise the success of the drive for carbines attracting young voters
In the UK, non-payment of taxes is subject to stamp duty increases.
The U.S. Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy a property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide young voters with affordable housing and target those with higher incomes.
In the UK, stamp duty increases will be imposed on individuals and organisations who do not pay taxes, with the government proposing to impose additional money on those who do not pay.
The surcharge - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, would include higher levels introduced in second homes two years ago and opportunities to buy - could be as high as three per cent.
The move is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Non-Britain residents will buy 13 per cent of the new properties being built in London, making it difficult for first-time renters to own their own homes.
With a large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country, many of the richest areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns."
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help more young people have their first home.
She has accused large construction firms of grabbing land and raising property prices by not using it, and has urged Mrs May to revoke the quota of affordable homes to correct Britain's "dwelling shame."
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and ending "no-fault eviction."
They demanded that the councils be given more powers to construct new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate the position of my Prime Minister to restoring British affection - one that life should be better for every new generation.
In other words, we need to fix our housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, that's not to say that individuals who don't live in the UK and companies based overseas can't afford to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For many, owning a home has become a distant dream, and the nightmare of sleeping on the street continues to be a reality."
Jack Rose: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Rose, head of Sunderland, said: "It's the ultimate ambition of me to be a manager at some point in my life.
The 42-year-old Scott, who has embraced the challenge of reviving NorthEast, is currently third in League One, three points down from first.
He has returned to the Stadium of Lights this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I want to play for my country.
I got a B cap and that's what it is," Ross told the BBC's Sport Sound of Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden since I was young, and that's always been something that tethered me.
"If the club succeeds, I will succeed," he said.
Other Sunderland managers ahead of Ross include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poete and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alova athletic head says he did not feel any anxiety to join a line of such established names at such a large club. he had previously rejected Barnes Lay and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"How can I take this club back to the Premier League?
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt that it is a Premier League club, he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I think if I can get the club back up there, I'm successful here."
Rose had only three years in a managerial career. she had served as assistant head at Dumbarton and as the coaching staff of Hearts for 15 months.
By the following season, St Mirren had been converted from a position of prominence to a champion title-holder.
Rose says she feels more comfortable now than she did at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy in the past.
"It was probably a really tense period," he recalled of his time in Alova.
"I honestly believe that management is more suitable for me than playing.
It's weird because I've done the job right, I've earned a lot, I've reached a lot of heights.
But it's really hard to play.
There is a lot to do each week.
In terms of work pressures and stress, I cannot escape from that, it will continue. however, the management work itself feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and I'm doing it now. It's the most comfortable thing I've ever done in my whole adult life."

The best time to visit the Pint is on Saturday at 5.30 pm
The summer heatwave has spurred the sale of struggling pubs in Britain, but at the same time has increased pressure on the restaurant network.
Sales of pubs and bars rose 2.7 per cent in July - while sales at restaurants fell 4.8 per cent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of CGA, a trade advisory firm that collected the data, said: “With continued sunshine and longer-term participation than England expected in the World Cup, even in July, sales in pubs rose by 2.8 per cent compared to the previous June model, but restaurants faced even tougher days.
The decline in restaurant sales in June was even more severe in July.
Pubs and bars, which are dominated by drink-sellers, performed better in terms of business than restaurants.
Although the sun's heat has affected the pubs where food dishes are predominant, it is not as serious as that of restaurant owners.
People want to go out drinking.
Sales of liquor in managed pubs and bars rose by 6.6 per cent month-on-month while food sales fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analytics firm RSM said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we’ve seen since late April.
When it comes to outdoor or outdoor marketing, weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the biggest determinant.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to be in constant distress. On the other hand, while year-on-year sales are seeing a decline of 4.8 percent, on the other hand, maintenance costs are increasing.
This long summer should not have come at a time when food-centric restaurants are in crisis. We have to decide in time whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August provide the much-needed relief."
The total sales growth for all pubs and restaurants, including those newly launched in July, was 2.7 per cent, reflecting slowing brands' product releases.
The 'Kaffer Peach Tracker', which tracks the sales of the pub, bar and restaurant industry in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 management teams with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that their parents don't know about
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - secretly have social media accounts that their parents and teachers don't know about, the survey revealed.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase of "fake Instagram" pages.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to parents.
One in five children <0xE2><0x80><0x93> some of whom are still 11 years old <0xE2><0x80><0x93> are secretly creating social media accounts that adults don’t know about.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake Instagram" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "clean" "main" account and had private accounts, showing their parents.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret hideout says that the teenage girl "raped me" on social media.
In research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Independent Schools Chiefs and Chief Teachers Conference’ (HMC), 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 said they had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's alarming that so many teens are caught up in the urge to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find."
Elyse Doyle is the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Mr. Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Governors.
Doyle is Scotland's most popular track and field athlete. President Ian Beatty praised his selection and described the last decade as a great opportunity to take advantage of Eliud's extensive experience at the international level to guide the sport.
"I have great respect for Eliud throughout Scotland, the UK and the world athletics community and I am confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him on board," Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to act as a voice for the athletes and hope I can really contribute towards guiding the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, is now a regular on the BBC.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered a stroke.
I couldnt walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether I will recover or to what extent I will recover.
It was hard work, but it was a full recovery. I learned how to walk again, and today I am doing brisk exercises!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!”
Anti-spam campaign against mother-to-be
There is a lot of controversy surrounding the company's parent company's online presence.
Consumer tech company LV has launched the world's first silent-wearing breast pump, and has released an ad video that shows how the new pump can help mothers express themselves.
This video features four mothers dancing in a straw shed: "Yes, I'll milk you, but you won't see any tails. If you think these are shallow, you're wrong. These are my breasts".
The lyrics continue: "Pump, pump, I give milk to children... Pump, pump, call for women's milk."
The announcement on the company's Facebook page has sparked a lot of controversy online.
The video has already garnered over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. those who have watched it have commented that it has taken the "horrible" dairy industry by storm.
"It's a shame to use that kind of sloppiness.
"We are the only ones who have the right to bear children, and we are the only ones who have the right to bear children," he said.
The baby's head is attached to the mother's breast (male or female)
She said: "It's very difficult for both the mother and the child.
But why not use this breast pump, which is produced for those who keep their children, for advertising?"
Someone else said, "He's got no brain."
Inarao defended the advertisement, and one woman said the song was "funny."
"This is a common idea.
If I were still playing, I'd buy it.
It is true that there is a tendency to overcook.
The ad may sound a little crazy, but it is true.
Igor is a genius at writing.
Another said: "It's really a joke on mothers who pump (at work and on the toilet) and feel like they're being suffocated."
"This is not an endorsement of the dairy industry."
Finally, the women in the ad show that they are wearing a breast pump inside their bra.
The principle behind the campaign is an insight into how many mothers who use a breast pump think they are ovaries.
However, the LV pump works perfectly quiet. It has no enemies or tubes. It sits well inside the breast-feeding bra. It gives women freedom of movement and the ability to pick up children.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: The LV pump was a revolutionary product that needed a bold and provocative start.
We wanted to talk about breast pumping and its challenges by demonstrating a similarity between women and dairy cows. This can be said in a fun and relatable way to show how the new pump can evoke an independent feeling.
This is not the first time that the LWE pump has been spotted in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two used a product to catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of children have been forced to flee their homes in a tent camp near the Texas border
The Trump administration's austerity measures have made it difficult for refugee children to provide for their parents.
Traditionally, those who want to raise such children are refugees themselves, and their existence in the country is further complicated by the fact that they want to raise them when their lives are uncertain.
Federal authorities have made it mandatory for individuals or families wishing to adopt children to provide a finger print so that such finger prints are then provided to immigration officials.
Matthew Albens, a senior official at Immigration and Custom Enforcement, told Congress last week that he had arrested dozens of people who tried to adopt minors without their agency.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal background.
"Nearly 80 per cent of the people who stay here illegally are either sponsors or family members of sponsors, most of whom have criminal background.
So we are trying to catch these people," Albans said.
The authorities have come up with new rules to ensure speedy disposal of cases of children, who have to be produced before the court within a month of their detention.
Most of them do not have to appear face-to-face, but instead appear via video call and present their legal status, which is heard by the immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible will be deported immediately.
Shelter workers have also reported that the longer children remain in custody, the more anxious and depressed they are, the more likely they are to develop feelings of violence and avoidance.
Advocates said that such opportunities are more likely in large facilities such as Tornills, which are so large that children with disabilities are not able to be cared for.
It's hard to imagine that a child who doesn't have the time to say goodbye to their parents will eventually be forced to move to a new home.
Syria to pull out US, French and Turkish troops
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem has appealed to the United Nations General Assembly to allow Syrian refugees to return home.
Moulem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops stationed illegally on Syrian soil were an excuse for them to fight against terrorism. He also issued a warning of action against these forces.
"They should be released immediately," he said at the time.
According to Moulem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria. Since 2011, 360,000 people have died and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight against terrorism and foreign forces illegally stationed in Syria until it gained control of its territory.
About 2,000 U.S. troops are in Syria, most of them training Kurdish and other Arab forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moulem said it was time for all of them to return home.
"We call on the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate such repatriations," he said.
"It's really about humanity."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided to Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and his opponents to end the war.
Ambassadors to the United Nations expressed hope that talks on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the insurgents between Russia and Turkey, would provide the right environment for the start of political dialogue.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has avoided the possibility of Russian-backed Syrian forces attacking the state, which is home to millions of people.
Moulem said there was a "clear deadline" for the deal and that the attack on Syria would be directed against all jihadist groups, including the al-Qaeda-backed Nusra Front.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to form a new committee, which will include members of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Moulem said the conditions of participation of the Syrian government in the committee are not in any way interference, adding that the purpose of the committee should be confined to examining the existing provisions of the Constitution.
Trump is going to be president again.
Whether it is impeachment or scandal, Trump will not lose the presidency, according to this logic, and he will be the president of the United States again in 2020, which is in line with the optimism of most liberals.
This is going to be the most dramatic presidential election ever!
In fact, there's no audience for it.
CNN's Prime Time ratings have more than doubled since 2014, reaching 1.05 million, while MSNBC's rating has tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had an average of 2.4 million Prime Time viewers, compared with 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" was the top show with 3.5 million viewers.

There is entertainment in them.
Of course, more than anything else on TV, stories from Washington can determine Roe's future, whether immigrant families will reunite, or whether the global economy will improve.
Change is only possible with the most talented people.
"However, the fact that Bob Woodward's book ""Fear"" has a ""deep background"", and that experts on Paul Manafort's $15,000 Astrich Leather Jacket (Garment Thick with Hubris) are discussing on TV, is not enough for us to see the implications of Stormy Daniels' description of Trump."
I can't see Super Mario either.
According to Brent Montagomery, chief executive of Pawn Stars, Wheelhouse Entertainment, every night there's a reality show that feels like it's about Trump feeding the debates, whether it's about a conflict with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un.
He believes that even if he misses a single episode, he is far behind.
When I reached Mr. Fless this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kuai, but he was taken inside to watch MSNBC while CNN was recording.

The money is being poured out of the House race in the tight mid-term elections
It's no surprise to see Pennsylvania's 17th run-off, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts that dropped two contenders for the same position.
This recently re-created suburban Pittsburgh district pits Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in the last special election.
Lamb is currently running against another Republican, Keith Rothfuss, representing the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in the Republican's favor.
The new 17th edition of the contest touched off a campaign finance slugfest between major party financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb rose to fame in Pennsylvania after being widely watched in a special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been contested by Republicans for a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Democrats have been given a bit of a boost.
U.S.S.L. Salvador was fined for supporting China, which later backed
Diplomats noted that Beijing in Washington had already identified with the Dominican Republic and Panama.
Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
"State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about any further decisions regarding Taiwan's recognition," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including in drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include financial aid cuts and proposed visa restrictions, hurt the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As in-house meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, a step in efforts to prevent migrants from making their way to the United States.
But by mid-September, he made it clear that the conference of top administration officials would continue, effectively ending any consideration of the penalty for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence now addressed the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration's willingness to import sites, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic from Washington without new harsh messages or punishments.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion, as described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions over the status of the anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by outside analysts close to the administration and they also spoke about the state of anonymity.
History of study
Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's obstruction of justice may be the next target, given there is now ample evidence of the public record.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly changed his investigation into whether Trump's campaign aligned with Russia in an attack on our elections.
"Congress needs to change hands as Mr. Trump prepares to go before the electorate again, and finally the verdict of his friends is final.
That was a lot of things, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable or that there is no equivalent for him in Europe.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight may last.
In 1938, when the German authorities were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, only the Westerners opposed them and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the ensuing genocide.
The course of history revolves around such points of reflection and the inevitability of democracy gets accelerated or delayed.
The United States faces many of these challenges.
What should we do if Mr. Trump attacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the future of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Last year, Rosenstein has been scandalous since this paper reported that he suggested secretly documenting the president and deciding that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' account is inaccurate.
"How do we respond to the newly requested F.B.I. Whether Brett Kavanaugh's investigation was not full or fair, or whether he was confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, do we vote for the Congress, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable, in the interim?
If we fail in such tests, democracy will have to suffer for a long time.
But I hope that we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who had occupied my ambassador house.
She survived, then immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table that held the swastika.

Rangers Graham Dornan was an optimist before the Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers' win over host Rapid Vienna, the Austrians, after an impressive win in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month puts them in a strong position to qualify from the European League's Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from equalizing 2-2 with Villarreal for the first time but Rangers believe the result could be used as a springboard for more things.
"It's a pleasure for us because Villarreal are a great team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end but, being a draw overall was probably a fair result.
"They played well in the first half and we were a good team.
It's going to be a big Thursday night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it was a tough game as they had a good result in their last match but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
"Last year was definitely tough, between all of my injuries and everything that happened with the changes to the club, now there's an emotional element about the place.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move on now, maybe beat us last season and now we have a chance."
Women are afraid of losing sleep.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves, very few people were talking about it with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were talking with their spouse about the cost of care in the long run.
Only 10 per cent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of themselves but they're not taking steps to engage in conversation," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business nationwide.
Heres where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don't convey your congratulations ahead of time, your family will not be ready.
Talk with your advisors and family to discuss where and how to accept care, as such options can play an important role in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisors can also help you with suggesting ways to make payments for such expenses.
Your provident fund options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy, to help you save on these expenses or self-insurance of your property as long as you have the money.
Get your legal documents out of the way: Face legal battles on the pass.
Get a health care proxy to learn about your medical care so you can designate a trusted person and make sure that if you are unable to communicate, it will be followed up by your professional.
Also, consider the power of attorney for your finances.
If you don't have the ability to make financial decisions and pay your bills, you can opt for a trusted person.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly parents need a medical emergency and they're on their way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions relating to medications and allergies?

A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in LibreCampaign
On his way home, a man was shot multiple times with an air rifle.
The victim was about 40 years old when he was shot and was in the Oxford Grove area of Liverpool, Devon, when he was struck in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting as a "random act" that took place around 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see the man who attacked him.
Their injuries were not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pula on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll likely to rise.
As communications were damaged, relief officials were unable to get any information from the Dongla Regency, which is located in the northern sector of the stake, which is close to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Some of the important facts about the island of Sulawesi and the island of Dongala are as follows:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a steep bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, where it is estimated to have a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
The regency of Dongala extends for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, the administrative zone located in the lower reaches of the area, is estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The central Sulawesi region is an important economic backbone and fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but it is mostly specialized in Morowali, a coastal region on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Relief and Resettlement Agency, Dongala has been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed in Dongala due to a tsunami.
In 1996, a tsunami killed nine people in western Dongala.
Indonesia is located in the seismic region of the Pacific Ring of Fire, which has always been prone to earthquakes.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of North Sumatra, in the Aceh region of Indonesia, on December 26, affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal region, more than half of which occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Indonesia's most populous island, Java, is struck by a magnitude 6.8 tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra region.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits the island of Mentawai in Sumatra, creating waves as high as 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and taking nearly 300 lives.
2016: As people recall from the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami, yet again an earthquake struck the PD Jaya Regency and caused devastation and panic.
This time no tsunami was disturbed, but more than 100 people died from the buildings that fell.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the northern part of the island, killing more than 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily disrupted thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Former Alaska governor's eldest son, track palin, and vice-presidential candidate sarah palin have been arrested on assault charges.
A man named Palin 29, in Alaska's Wasilla, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, resisting interference and arrest in a report of domestic violence, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when the woman's acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.
The KTUU reported that Palin was being remanded at the Matt-Su Pretrial Facility and placed on a $500 unsecured bond.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "certainly, not guilty" when his appeal was heard, the network reported.
Palin has faced three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, a one-day jail sentence, and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Pauline.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pali.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being heard in a court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and being a drug addict in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior stemmed from his service to PTSD in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: Death toll mounts to 10
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake in Sulawesi, Indonesia.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck in central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The videos are going viral on social media .
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu, on the occasion of the tsunami that hit the coast.
U.S. prosecutors seek unusual death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York have sentenced Seifulo Saipove, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rarest sentence not performed in a state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipoev "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent seeking the death penalty, filed in the South's new district.
As per the court record, both these counts amount to capital punishment.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipaw on a 22-count indictment that included eight murder charges in aid of a gangster, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases involving violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," which prosecutors described as "cruel, brutal and fraudulent," according to the report.
"Diego Enrique Angeline, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlize, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pagniuko caused injury and loss to their families and friends.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has been the last to hear the death penalty case for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953 when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed two years earlier after plotting to run a church for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On 19 June 1953, both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death by electric chair.
A resident of Saipaw, Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of compassion in days and months, according to court records.
Police said he had a good sense of what he was doing.
According to the indictment, Saipaw told authorities that he was inspired after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the flag of ISIS be displayed in his hospital room.
He has also pleaded not guilty to the charge no.22.
David Patton, one of the representatives of the federal public defenders representing Saipaw, said he was "apparently disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"A death sentence, instead of life in prison with no possibility of any kind of release, would make all those involved pull back for a long time," Patton said.
Saipaw's team had earlier asked the judges not to award the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit
During a protest at the Tory Conference today, Nigel Farage vowed to " mobilize the people's army."
Theresa May's MP suggested that for saying that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU - the former Yukip leaders said politicians from Euroskeptics should feel 'hot'.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would already be out if Faraj had not been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces is different, she said, stressing the individual struggle of those who want to stay in the city's anti-Brexit movement.
The prime minister is struggling to keep track of his checkers' compromise plan amid attacks from Brexiteers (Brexit Bengalis), renegades (who like to stay here) and Europeans.
The Allies insisted that she go ahead and make a deal with Brussels - despite heavy opposition - and urged Euroseptics and Labour to choose between her package and the 'troubles'.
"Bone said at a rally in Solihull that he wanted to do ""Chuck Checkers""."
Faraz was to be made a peer and he suggested that the responsibility of negotiations with Brussels be given to him.
"If they had been in charge, we would have already been out," he said.
The Welling Borough MP said: 'I stand for Brexit but we have to check the checkers.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight happily in the world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Bonne dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain without a Brexit is absolutely false.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also present at the rally, when she told reporters: My advice is a little: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chekers are not popular in the public sphere, the opposition does not vote for it, which is not even popular in our party and our cadres' circle, really these cadres fight in the streets and pick us for the first position.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.'
In a message pointed out to Mrs. May, she said: 'The Prime Minister will also keep his seat when he keeps his promises.'
Faraz said the politicians conducting the rally should be 'hot-touched' if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 poll.
"It's now a matter of trust between us - our people - and our political class," he said.
'We are here today to clearly state that they are trying to betray Brexit and 'we will not let them do so.'
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he said: I want you to warm up to our political class, which is betraying Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the troops of the people of this country who gave us the victory at Brexit and will never rest until we make our country a proud United Kingdom that is independent, self-governing.'
Meanwhile, the reenactors marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group started this weekend, the activists blew up the Tories against the Brexit banners.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues he experienced on the party app as the conference began.
"These people will tell us that we can have IT systems in addition to Canada etc. and have all the technology, like a conflict-free border with Ireland and a free border for free trade, etc.," he said.
"It's a full blast.
There's no such thing as a perfect Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to take 'hard decision' to run for U.S. presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the U.S. election that she would "make the tough decision to run for president."
A Massachusetts Democrat in a town hall in western Massachusetts, he spoke about his future plans, the Boston Globe reported.
Warren, who has often been critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Jeff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that Trump could be defeated in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting he held with constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.
The people who attended the meeting asked her if she was planning to run for president.
"The time has come that women have to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes the top-ranked woman," Warren replied.
LSU Team Sims Murder: Murderer Arrested
Police in La Baton Rouge announced on Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dietian Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
He had released a video of the shooting of the murder on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247 Sports reported.
Wade had come forward to rescue his friend and Simpson had shot him.
Simpson was questioned and he admitted to being in the scene with the weapon and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-6-inch-long Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, including 10 matches, and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds with an average of 17.4 minutes per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title round after winning against Sebastian Vettel after team order
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified above Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' orders would play a greater role in the race.
From the pole, Batas got off to a good start and defended his position in the first two turns, preventing Hamilton from getting any points and thus inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Wettel was the first to go to the pits and let Hamilton drive in the traffic behind the group, which was crucial.
Mercedes then pitted a lap and Vettel got out in the back, but Hamilton went ahead by showing some drive-by action to the wheel, which allowed the Ferrari driver to pass through from the inside reluctantly after a double move to free the third corner to protect the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He led most of the race as he held up his tires to quickly finish the race and push Kimi Raikkonen into fourth place.
He eventually came to the pit in the 44th lap but could not accelerate through the remaining eight rounds as Roykonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did all the work wonderfully on the weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team has done such an extraordinary job of having a two-for-one," Hamilton said.
It's a really bad language.
US President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, stressing that she had not leaked a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president responded that Ford did not directly address the testimony he gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but rather that what was happening in the Senate showed people were "selfish and disgusting and false."
"One of the things that's been happening the last few days in the Senate, and that's been beautiful, is how you feel when you see people who are angry, mean and mean and disgusting and lying," he said.
"You see the release and the leak and then they're like, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
I did not do it."
do you remember?
Ding Dong, are you done?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't screw up."
Okay, wait a minute.
Whether we leaked ... no, we didn't," he added to the Senator's one-on-one impression.
In July, Ford had sent a letter to Feinstein detailing the charges against Kavanaugh, and it had leaked earlier than September - but Feinstein denied the leak was from his office.
"I'm Dr. Ford's accusers, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as a secret as she asked."
But his refusal seems to have caught up with the president, who responded at Saturday night's rally: "What I'm saying is, it's really bad slang.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Defending the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president accused the Democrats of using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They have decided to withdraw from power by any means necessary.
"You look at all the selfishness, hate in them, they don't care who gets hurt, they don't even care who they run to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars beat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars avenged their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead with brilliant strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney helped his team equalize the Dwyer Giants lead.
Two Lucas Lundwald Nielsen goals had equalized Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard Dundee's goals before confirming the win.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keef, who came to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter of the season between the teams, with Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the opening goal with the help of Kendall McFall in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m., while Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later when David Rutherford provided assistance.
Sullivan put his team on the field at 13:10 in the opening period of the match. Kaunie then equalized with 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into the first break by scoring a second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The hosts rallied again and Bouchard added another point with a Powerplay goal in the 27:37 minutes.
Couney and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and ensured their team's victory in the final half of the fifth period.
Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the plane by air traffic controllers
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero for sacrificing his life to help hundreds of passengers get off the plane safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and hundreds are missing after an earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
This is a major problem in the city and most of the people are still trapped under the debris.
Even though all of his colleagues fled in fear, 21-year-old Antonian Gunawan Agung, who was hovering over the earthquake, did not leave the Cis Al Zufri Airport, Palu Airport's control tower.
He was still in the tower when the BAT Flight 6321, which was flying above the runway at the time, landed safely.
He thought the tower had collapsed and jumped out.
He died at the hospital.
"His decision saved the lives of hundreds of people," Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Johnness Sirait, told ABC News in Australia.
From Balikappapan in Kalimantan, we arranged for a helicopter to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
We lost him before he could get on the plane.
"It breaks our hearts to hear this," he said.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster management agency said access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutang was limited.
"Many bodies are still in the wreckage, but it is believed that the number is even higher because many have not been able to reach them," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-meter-high tide destroyed the stakes and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in material for aid and assistance.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
"Mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
John Gelfand, head of Indonesia's International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross rescue workers are rushing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a disaster, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Sunday: "I am anxiously asking all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to the waiver.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
More than 550 people died in an earthquake in Indonesia's Lombak earlier this year.
One person missing after Lagoon plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini
The airline, which operates the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean off Micronesia, officially said one person was missing after all 47 passengers and crew on board were safely evacuated from the plane.
As of Saturday afternoon, the male passengers could not be counted, Air Niugini said in a statement.
The airline said it was trying to find the man with the help of local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger's age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
Six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are stable, the airline said.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the aircraft landed in the lagoon area just behind the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
The U.S. Coast Guard said the plane was downed.
"It's very good," Jones said.
Janes said she and others managed to run in waist-level water to find an emergency exit in the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were frightened and shouting, causing him a minor head injury.
The Navy said sailors working nearby also rushed to the rescue and helped improve the wharf, using an air-filled boat to push people off shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Figures from the Aviation Safety Network suggest that 111 people have died in a PNG-registered airline crash in the past two decades but the name of Air Niugini does not appear in any of the crashes.
Analysts say the woman was burnt alive during the night
The prosecution, which held a trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014, reserved its argument on Saturday.
Paul Rowlett, a judicial analyst, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of U.S. intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to collect the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers (who was murdered) on the night Jessica died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones, which showed she was with Chambers on the evening of Tellis' murder, contrary to what she had said, The Clarion Ledger reported.
Arroyo is said to have been with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, but data shows that his cell phone was with the Chambers at the time, police went to question Sanford.
Sanford had come to testify on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors heard that Tellis said he was in a Sanford truck that night, they said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another anomaly is that I met Telly's Chambers about two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for about a week.
After the Chambers' death, Rautett said Tellis deleted the Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
She said: "He's saved her life.
The defense has decided to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the trial is expected to go to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
The triplets of hip hop have accepted the challenge of overcoming a negative view of this style through positive messages through their music.
The High Breed, Pram Bristol, and Clay Hip Hop have moved away from their original political messages and are now committed to solving social problems.
They want to go back to its roots and popularize conscious hip-hop all over again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Louie.
Another black person?!
A New York nurse sued a couple who sent her a message on the topic of "racialism"
"A New York nurse has mistakenly received a message from a woman that she was ""another black man"" and filed a lawsuit against the couple, calling it a ""discriminatory message""."
The couple have denied allegations that they have racism and have compared the case to a "sully."
When Dado Jisel Maris, a new child care provider, arrived on his first day of work in 2016, two mothers named Linsey Plasco-Flaxman were upset when they found out he was black.
"No, another black man," Mrs. Plasco-Fluxmann sent a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maris twice.
After realizing his embarrassing mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maris, who had "experienced shyness," claiming that the nurse, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was sent home and that he was expecting someone of Filipino descent, the New York Post reported.
Maurice received a salary for a day's work and was then sent home in Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for racism based on the message and is also seeking compensation at $350 per day for six months, a live-in gig she was initially hired to work for, without a contract.
"I want to show that, you see, you don't do that," he told the Post on Friday, "I know it's racial discrimination."
By saying that the dismissal of Maurice's employment was a reasonable task, the couple committed to the claim that he was racist, accusing him of not being able to trust her after she insulted him.
"My wife sent me a message that I couldn't tell her anything.
She's not a nationalist.
We're not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
Do you have a wife who can't take care of her children?
Your newborn baby?
tell you.'
Describing the case as a case of "fraud," Plasco said his wife had only two months left to bear a child and that he was "in a very difficult situation."
"Do you trust these people?"
"It's not a good investment," he said.
While the legal case is still going on in court, the court of public opinion has been at the forefront of condemning the couple on social media, with the number of people blaming them for their behavior and logic increasing from moment to moment.
"Those who published the padding tone feared that it would be difficult to accept the idea of a talking bear," a new letter said
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was released, wrote in her letter: "It is very difficult for one person to play the role of another.
It's really amazing to think about the secret behind Paddington's phenomenal success."
Taking inspiration from a bear toy, she worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing a children's book. She was confident in her work even after her book was rejected. When the 60th anniversary of the book's publication took place, the event was indeed a kind of "sweet" experience because her father left us only last year.
Apart from the padding ton, she also says that according to her, the padding ton is "like an honorary member of our household," which is what she tells us about its phenomenal success.
She also said, "He was one of those people who didn't speak a word, yet spoke very little. He never bragged about his accomplishments."
"But Paddington was a real person to him, just like if you had a successful child in front of you: you wouldn't be proud of what you did, you wouldn't be proud of what you didn't do.
In my opinion, he saw Paddington's success in this way.
Even though it was his creation and concept, he gave Paddington his full credit for it."
I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad used to call repeatedly, to say that it was really serious, I didn't expect her to accept that call," Mrs. Ednan-Lapper House said.
"Then I got a call from Nad that within the next two minutes she was going to die and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I said I would join you soon.
Ill be with you.
The medicines given by the doctor to pump her heart slowly came out of their space and she left the body.
She had died a short time ago and her body was in a state of disrepair.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that everything was predetermined.
I could not scream or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by my family members and others.
I had to put it all together."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Lapper House, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - forgetting the ordeal she was experiencing.
She said, "Nobody knows."
"I turned my head downwards, and shed tears throughout the entire journey.
It's hard to explain, but this indescribable sympathy for Nad when it's on the plane.
He needs my love and guidance.
I know how much he loved her."
Women's Self-Defense Units to help stop suicides on the streets
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Two women, Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys, are pasting inspiring messages on the Welsh Bridge, along with a phone number to call for help or comfort.
When Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 years old, he began to suffer from depression. He committed suicide when he was about 18 years old.
"I don't want anyone to have to suffer every day," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a promising chef with a sense of humor that was infectious.
Everyone was sold on him.
He's going to get a slap in the face in any room."
However, he also quit his job before he died, so he was "really in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then only 11 years old, was the brother he had found after taking his own life.
Mrs. David said: "I'm always worried that something bad is going to happen."
Mrs. David created the cards because, "No matter how sad you are, there are people to talk to, share your pain with, and you will have a friend."
Don't just sit there and talk."
Shrimati, Humphreys, Davies' girlfriend of several years, has lost the fact of her 15-year-old life, Mark, after the death of his mother.
"She didn't tell me she was suffering from depression or was feeling sad."
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He was in the Christmas room - when the children opened the box of Christmas presents, he didn't even look at them."
She said his death was an irreplaceable shock, but she tried to come out of it: "It was a big blow to their family.
It differentiated us.
We have fought and we have won."
If you suffer from depression or sadness, please call 116 123 (UK and Ireland) or email jo<0x40>samaritans.org. Here you will find a counselor to talk to.
The FBI continues to investigate, so the future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake.
"I think, whatever he hears, we get a little bit of it - the time and scope of the investigation is very limited, we can bring in a little bit of unity," Mr. Flake said.
Why is Kavanaugh and his Republican friends seeking an FBI investigation?
Its existence is due to time.
The midterm elections are due to take place on November 6, which is just five weeks away - and as expected, Republicans are not getting the results they want.
George W. Bush telephoned to call the Senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
I still don't understand, Mr. Kavanaugh needs to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, so Mike Pence, who allowed the vice president to end the tie and tell the Supreme Court?
The number of people fleeing from North Korea under Kim's rule is "decreased"
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean defectors has dwindled since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago.
South Korea's Unification Minister Park Byung-seung also provided figures, according to which 2,706 people fled in 2011, compared to 1,127 the previous year.
According to Park, the reason for this is the doubling of the fee for human smuggling along the border between North Korea and China.
There has been no official statement on this.
Most of the North Korean defectors have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that some 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the 1953 Korean War.
Most have fled through the Chinese border, which shares a long border with their country, rather than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers those who have fled as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and in most cases, they are extradited back to North Korea.
North and South Korea are still technically at war, although relations have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization.
The development comes after a historic meeting between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in Singapore in June in which the two discussed how to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, condemned the U.S. aid to the country.
"Without American confidence, we are not going to unilaterally dismantle our national security," he said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh a "maniac," thus making him ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "a lunatic" and expressed the view that he was temporarily ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview with the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but notice when a woman ever behaved that way, they called her a 'maniac'," Pelosi said Thursday while responding to Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
He denied the allegations that the assault took place when both Cavanagh and Christine Blasey Ford were teenagers.
He clearly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "conspiracy and assassination of organized characters" organized by liberals.
Pelosi expressed her belief that Kavanaugh's testimony proved his view that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it highlighted that he was biased against Democrats.
"Because of those statements and his statement about Clinton and the Democrats, I think he's going to disqualify himself," he said.
Pelosi was frustrated when she was asked if she would seek impeachment if Kavanaugh was confirmed and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not just inappropriate to have to appear in the Supreme Court, they're inappropriate to have in court right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is presently a Judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said she was concerned about Kavanaugh's rulings on the Affordable Care Act as a Democrat, or Roe v. Wade, because according to the Kavanaugh conservative judge.
In their confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not respond to questions about whether he would withdraw some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time to expect a person who is mad and partisan to go to court and say, 'That's not great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to control it.
It was the rage of a righteous man, that anger comes out even after months and years, and she can't get it out without crying.
"When we are angry, we cry," 45-year-old Steinem told me.
"I don't think this is unusual, do you?"
"A woman officer helped me so much, she said she cried when she was angry too, but she developed a technique, which means when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person with whom she was talking, 'I'm crying because you might think I'm sad,'" she said.
I am furious."
Then she continued.
And I thought that was amazing."
Tears are considered a way to vent out anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
My first memories at work were of a male-dominated office, where I once cried in an inexplicable rage. Then an elderly woman grabbed my neck strap and pulled it. It was a little scary that someone was pulling me this way <0xE2><0x80><0x93> I could see who was pulling me up the stairs.
She said to me, "Don't ever show them what you're crying about."
They don't know you're angry.
They will feel sorry for you, and they will feel sorry for you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in presidential contests.
In 1987, when she was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Heart Monkey Business and moved away from this embarrassment, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, thus finding that she had no reason to withdraw from the presidential race.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Some called it "Snow White" and "Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign was already too late to start, and she had backed away from collecting donations. She had vowed to raise $2 million, and had even said she would withdraw from the competition if she didn't.
It was a losing battle.
She learned that some of her supporters paid $1,000 to the men and gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she made a speech announcing that she would not start a campaign campaign, she came out of her emotions - thanking the people who supported her, making it very difficult to raise money and reach the goal. She expressed frustration about the system.
"You might think I have a breakdown from nerve weaknesses," Mrs. Schroeder recalled, describing how journalism reacted to her.
"I thought you were my business partner.
I wonder what they're going to write on my wall.
"Is she crying?"""
The U.S.-China trade war has been good for China.
The trade war between the US and China is making no noise today, and although the war is far from over, experts have expressed the opinion that a rift between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's major exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important development will affect tariffs this week on $200 billion worth of goods, with half of all goods coming from China to the United States being hit effectively.
Beijing has also retaliated each time, most recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to join Savva alongside the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is not likely to shrink any further soon.
Retreating Washington means being a target of demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be very embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing is able to play its game properly, the pressure of the American trade war will positively support China in the long run by reducing the inter-dependence between the two economies.
"Experts are of the opinion that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would be devastating to the economies of both countries, much more dangerous than what was previously agreed upon," said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank on Asian issues.
Syrian "refugees" to be deported to Turkey
After seven years of war, the government has pledged to rebuild the country, asking refugees to voluntarily return and help.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the situation in the country was improving.
Today the situation is very stable and safe. I thank you for the progress you have made in fighting terrorism.
The government will continue to work hard to bring the areas ravaged by terrorists back to normalcy.
"The time has come for the people who have left the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic policies, to voluntarily return home.
According to the United Nations, an estimated 5.5 million people fled Syria in 2011.
There are millions of people in this country who need our help.
Al-Moulem said the Syrian government would welcome those who would help rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not accept aid from countries that had helped his country's rebellion or from countries that were providing conditional assistance.
European team of the Paris-Roubaix Cup
Team Europe beat USA 16.5-10.5 to win the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the Danish-born captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the American team.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled without form for much of the tournament, dipped his tee-shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all of his rounds, making him one of only 1 in 4 players to have achieved 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States lost to Denmark's Thorbj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Olesen in the 5th and 4th round
World top-ranked Dustin Johnson probably lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who played his final Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia of Spain was the all-time winner of European tournaments with a career score of 25.5.
"I didn't usually cry, but today I couldn't stop.
This is a kind of a tough year.
Thank you to Thomas for believing in me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
Garcia, who was passionate about winning the European Cup, said: "I'm happy, I'm happy to have contributed to the team's win."
He handed the pawn to his compatriot John Ramm, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in singles 2 and 1 on Sunday.
"I'm really incredibly proud. I can't believe I beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
This is indeed strange. Tiger Woods, who has won 14 major titles, is the second-highest tally since Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled too much this weekend, but only Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau played their best throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought well.
This morning we did a little bit of group work.
But we have destroyed it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All three players played very well.
"We will rejoin, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will continue to do so.
I love these 12 players and am proud to serve as a leader.
I salute you.
We have played well."
