The Welsh AMs were worried about 'being like fools'
There is a confusion among some AMs that their title as MWPs (Welsh Members of Parliament) should be changed.
This is due to the change in the name of the Legislative Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
People across the political spectrum were concerned that this could be called a travesty.
A Labour AM said it "resonates with Twp and Pwp," adding that his team was concerned.
For readers who aren't in Wales: Twp in Welsh means "stupid" and pwp means "stupid."
One Floyd AM said the entire group was "not happy" and suggested alternative ways.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but that it had a minor verbal issue with Muppet from the MWP.
In this context the Welsh letter W, Yorkshire is pronounced like the English spelling.
The Legislative Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the law to introduce name changes, said: How the legislators are called upon at the end of any one of the interpretations will certainly be a matter for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of its public consultation on the recommendations, which included a majority of support for calling the legislature the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AMs, the commission supported Welsh parliamentarians, or WMPs, but the MWP's choice received more support in public consultation.
AMs are obviously suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus is likely to be a headache for chief executive Elin Jones, with a draft law on the changes expected to be submitted within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms includes other changes to the way the legislature works, including provisions for the disqualification of AMs and the organisational rules of the committee system.
During the debate on the legislation, AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote system was set up in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long said its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership efforts for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is against the name change, has said he will boycott the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Soren Save, argue that the name change is simply a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells drop in Harlem protest
"Earlier, when I used to talk to the elders, they used to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner.
Today, there is nothing.
He said it was understandable that they were missing.
He said that nowadays people are coming together in different ways.
Bars are no longer the rooms in the neighborhood where people usually go.
In the case of churches, he worries that the money generated by selling assets won't last as long as leaders expect, "sooner or later they'll get back to where they started."
He said that the buildings built by people who did not help the neighbouring sanctuaries will be replaced by churches.
The majority of those who buy individual homes in these buildings are white, and he said, "These churches will be completely closed because those who buy individual homes will be members of the churches."
The two churches, built in front of Harlem by whites, are for blacks - the Metropolitan Community, 1870, ten years after St. Martin.
The original White Methodist denomination left the 1930s behind.
A black church nearby took the title of the building where the worship took place.
St. Martin came under the control of a black church under John Howard Johnson, who boycotted retailers at 125th Street, on Main Street, shopping at Harlem, which opposed the promotion and hiring of blacks.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they sold the grill.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir of St. Martin, proudly called the guillotine "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who played the guillotine in July called it a cultural treasure and an "irreplaceable historical tool."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, said it was also the world's first known guillotine to be played by Dionisio A. Lind, a black musician who moved to the big guillotine at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martins did not compensate him.
The past few months at St. Martin's have been a complicated story for some architects and contractors brought in by church leaders and through the Episcopal diocese.
Vestry - the nominating leaders of the ecclesiastical control body - wrote to the ecclesiastical council in July that the ecclesiastical sent architects and contractors to the ecclesiastical district, despite Vestry's non-involvement in hiring them, were "expecting expenses" for the ecclesiastary.
Some church members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in a labyrinth in California
A 13-year-old boy jumped to catch a lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California and was hit by a shark and injured, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beckens Beach in Encinitas.
Chathamal told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, while he was jumping into the water and playing with friends for about half an hour, he heard the boy screaming for help and approached the group to help get the boy out of the water.
"At first I thought he was shouting in excitement of catching the lobster, but then I realized he was shouting, ""Sucks, bites!"""
You got me!'
As soon as I saw him, my whole body was ablaze."
I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'
The boy was airlifted to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in a critical condition.
It is not known what type of weapon was used in the attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it was not dangerous.
He added that there were serious injuries on his body.
The coast from Bonto Beach to Swami's in Isinidas in Casablanca has been closed for 48 hours for investigations and for safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are non-hazardous.
Seymour has a strong focus on the UK market.
Sainsbury's has brands such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams that are beautifully stacked in departmental assistants and department stores.
The UK's beauty market, worth 2.8 billion euros, is growing, driven by a decrease in sales of fashion and household products, and large cosmetics will be tested at 11 stores across the country.
"Stores are now investing in cosmetics to make space for cosmetics on the shelves that used to be TV, microwave and home appliances".
Sainsbury's said it will double its volume to sell up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPawPaw for the first time.
As there is more space in areas with branded products such as boots, there will be more space for existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelle and Burt's Bees.
Supermarket wants to reintroduce its boutique makeup store. Most of the products are made by wagons. The products are very popular among the young people who are shopping.
Additionally, The Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, will be offering discounts at two of the Saintesbury stores, the first store opened in Grayton, south London last week, and the second store to open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
With people shopping online and buying limited quantities of food at stores that are close to their daily needs, supermarkets need to come up with additional plans to get them to the stores and visit.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coop said the stores were growing like departmental stores, so the supermarket is trying to move beyond discounting companies such as Aldi and Lidl to offer more services and non-food products.
Of the hundreds of stores, Sainsbury's has set up a large number of Argos stores. Habitat is also launching a large number of stores, both of which were acquired by Sainsbury's two years ago, strengthening the sale of the products, making it a profitable venture.
An earlier attempt by the supermarket to restructure its cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury attempted a joint sale with Boots, but ended up in confusion as to how to separate the drug store profits from its supermarket profits.
Sainsbury's recently sold its 281 store drug store to Lloyd's of Celesio for 125 million euros.
Lloyds said it plans to sell products of high-end skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, across four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Business at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned and beautified the look and surroundings of our cosmetics stacks for our customers.
We have trained staff to provide advice on the sales process.
Our brands are the hubs for beauty products that challenge the old shopping system because they are in convenient locations with a well-designed look that caters to every need."
Peter Jones is angry at Hallie Wilby's decision to walk out of the 11-million-euro deal.
Peter Jones is angry with the departure of TV host Hallie Wilby from the 11-million-euro deal of the Dragons Den fame deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV due to focus on a new deal.
They don't have the time to spend on their branding.
The brand's business has been compared to that of Kenneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old announced his retirement on Instagram.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den fame is furious as he decided to abandon his lucrative brand at the last minute and focus on a new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
At a meeting at the head office of his business building in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, a TV presenter said that Jones was angry, according to credible reports, that Wilby did not have time to pay enough attention to his brand of truth because of Wilby's new contracts worth 1.5 million euros.
The business was compared to the Kenneth Baltro's Goop brand and was expected to be more than double Willaby's estimated 11 million euros worth of business.
When 37-year-old Willaby announced on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones left the UK and went to one of his holiday homes.
This was done on the basis of Halley's priorities.
It seems that he has decided to take the next 20 years into his own hands.
The decision came as a shock to all involved.
No one could have predicted what would happen on Tuesday.
The whole of the warehouse at Marlowe Head Office was ready for the sale of the goods.
According to experts, the company's investment in mattresses, candles and household items will be severely hampered by the departure of this morning's host, and its launch will be delayed further.
A long friendship may come to an end.
Willaby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willaby started the business in 2016 with Cape. Jones, 52, took over as president in March.
The couple used to go on vacation together, and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willaby is the brand ambassador of M&S as a replacement for ITV's I'm A Celebrity host Ant McFarlin.
A person close to Jones said last night that he was unable to comment on Jones's business dealings.
"We fell in love after a long conversation."
He mocked the North Korean leader for his positive comment and the media's possible criticism of him for not speaking as he did.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said it in the voice of a "newsman."
I didnt give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump's first in Singapore, the first step toward turning North Korea into a nuclear-free country.
However, the talks on the nuclear deal have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top official, Ri Yong Ho, told UN leaders at a general conference on Saturday that it had not received any "relevant response" from the United States to North Korea's rapid arms proliferation efforts.
Instead, he sees the U.S. allowing things that are aimed at maintaining pressure.
During his speech, Trump spoke in a very positive tone.
We have a good relationship with North Korea.
There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people have been killed.
We have a good relationship now, he said.
The goal is to complete rocket launches, help secure the release of hostages, and send surplus U.S. troops home.
He said his efforts to improve relations with China had been successful.
Looking at the crowd in front of him, Trump said there were 200 people there, rather than trying to force 10,000 people out of the complex.
The earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
After the Lombok earthquake, they were told that there was no need for foreign non-governmental organizations.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster declaration has been issued as the primary reason for seeking international aid.
On several occasions, they have made it clear that unfortunately they have not sought international help, which makes it a bit more challenging, Champang said.
It is not yet clear where the foreign workers will work to send a team to save the children in Balu.
Sudobo, a national disaster communications spokesman, said Indonesian authorities were reviewing Balu's situation to see if international companies were allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Indonesians are often prone to earthquakes, but they are not immune to natural disasters.
Although tsunami settlements were built in Aceh, they are not commonly found in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning has been issued, the absence of a tsunami warning has also resulted in casualties.
During this time, traveling between several islands in Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters are becoming more complex.
The hospital ship, which was stationed in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims, was heading to Balu, but it took three days before it could reach the new area.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo spent a lot of money on roads and railways, making repair of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the focus of his election campaign.
However, the next year's re-election saw the financial crisis paralyze Jokowi's administration.
Indonesia's most restrictive faith is a continuing separatism of the Muslim majority.
Violence in the streets by Christian and Muslim groups using fireworks, bows and arrows and other deadly weapons has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced tens of thousands from their homes.
Notice: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge Tips for Deep Balancing and. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge had bought the pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when the team trailed 1-0 at 30 yards from the Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball to the left of his head before it hit the post.
As it moved to the top right edge of the web, the effort went above the box as well.
He reached the top of the mountain, and the sky was overcast.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: “I was trying to get the ball, I was trying to be like Shaw, I was trying to create myself.
He picked it up and took a deep breath.
Chelsea took 1-0 at half time after scoring in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Matteo Kovacic was given a Blues Striker Pass Pack by Matteo Kovacic in that game before making a spin near midfield and sprinting in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic gave a quick give-and-go at midfield.
He threw the ball into the box, putting the ball at risk.
Liverpool's Alison Becker's left leg ended up in a far-off web post with a shot post, risking crossing the safety line.
Liverpool will take on Napoli at 3pm on Wednesday at Naples' San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
Indonesia's disaster agency says the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
At a press conference on Friday, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck and waves up to 20 feet high.
The city, with a population of more than 380,000, has fallen into the dust of broken buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body in Merseyside's Brigantinehead this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found at the John Street Cresson Museum at 7.55am with cut wounds.
Police asked people in the area to come forward if they saw anything about the incident.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagen said: 'The preliminary investigation is ongoing and I request anyone around John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they see or hear anything.
I'd like to ask someone, especially taxi drivers, who might have taken a picture with the dashcam camera in the car.
A police spokesman said the body was of a woman from Birkenhead and was inside a building there.
In the afternoon, the woman's friends were called to the scene of the incident and asked if the woman was Southpatra in their eyes this morning.
Police said that they are investigating the matter and are trying to contact the relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver, who lives in the Grayson Meuse area, told police that no one in the area was allowed to leave while he was trying to return to his home.
He was shocked when he realized what had happened.
Residents in the area say it will take several hours to get there.
A police officer could be heard saying that the entire area is now being treated as part of the crime scene.
A woman at the scene of the crime was crying.
"It's very bad," he said again.
Two police vehicles and a van were parked outside the detention centre at 2pm.
A large number of officers stood inside the barricaded area and monitored the structure of the flats.
If anyone has any information, they can call <0x40>MerpolCC on 101 or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and enter 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Statue of Parliament is the latest target in the 'rewriting of history' category
Many of England's cultural and religious antiquities were destroyed by his radical saints, such as the Taliban, and were exiled.
But, Gramwell Society explains that the idea of Mr. Griggs is foolish and is trying to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Gramwell Society, said: The current debate over the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster is inevitable.
Cromwell did not order or undertake to break the symbols of England's civil wars.
It is possible that he was influenced by his father, who lived in the early part of the 20th century.
Sir William Hamo Thornicraft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is a testimony to the 19th-century thought, and many of those familiar with history feel it is appropriate to celebrate him.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell, celebrated by many in the late 19th century, was more than ever as a defender of Parliament against external problems and pressures in the monarchy.
It is only after a long debate that we will know whether or not it is true.
The subsequent development of our country was the result of the chaos of the middle of the 17th century, and it is certain that the single person who represented part of that divide was Gramwell.
His achievements are worthy to be celebrated and remembered."
Chinese farmer dies of swine flu
According to local media reports, the farmer was killed in a pig attack at a market in southwest China.
The farmer, known only by his family name, Yan, was found dead in a market in the Liubanzui area of Guizhou province in southern China, with serious wounds on his heart.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm in Sining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly went to the nearby Yunnan province with his cousin to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead and the door of the nearby pig shed was open.
He said that there was blood on the door of the big pig.
A report by the Forensic Science Department also confirmed that the farmer died after being hit by a pig weighing 550 pounds.
According to Guiyang Evening News, the farmer, known by the family name 'Wu', said his cousin's legs were bloodied and in a decomposed state.
Footage captured on surveillance cameras showed Yann going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed him didn't belong to Jan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it could not be attacked by anyone else.
Yan's family and others in the market demanded compensation for his death.
Before that, attacks on humans by pigs have rarely been recorded.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig in a field in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer's tractor weighed 650 pounds and was hidden by a pig. His wife screamed in fear and threw it out.
In 2012, a farmer in the state of Oregon was attacked by his pigs. He told CBC News, a farmer in the Manitoba area, that pigs in general are not aggressive, but they are aggressive because of the taste of blood.
"They're playful.
We get them wrong. They don't come out to attack you.
You just have to give them respect."
Heavy rain is expected in the south-west of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening and moving beyond the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected to hit northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
The storm is expected to make landfall around 5 a.m. with a wind speed of 85 mph and a Category 1 hurricane, and is expected to make landfall on Sunday morning, 385 miles southwest of Punto Egina, Mexico.
It is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming in the Pacific Ocean, moving toward the west coast of the United States. When Baja California makes landfall as a tropical storm on Monday, tropical humidity in the north will push it to the southwest of the United States.
The storm is expected to bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Thereafter, the tropical humidity is likely to cause widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west in the coming days as the new low pressure area is formed.
Domestically, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and landslides in the desert.
Low-temperature wet conditions will result in 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour in some areas, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in Arizona.
As per the nature of the tropical rain, there is a possibility of sudden flooding and bad weather conditions.
When it rains in the desert, it becomes very difficult to walk.
Due to heavy rains, the canals will become like rivers that are overflowing. Rain accompanied by thunderstorms will also cause dust to build up along with strong winds.
A low-pressure area is expected to bring heavy rain to southern California.
There is a possibility of half an inch of rain, with winds blowing to the extent that some dust will build up, and in some places roads will be affected.
This is the first rain in the region since the monsoon.
There will be scattered tropical rain in Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, followed by widespread rain on Monday and Tuesday.
There will be heavy rain in all four corners of the country from Tuesday to Wednesday.
October can see some extreme temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes it can cause dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
The dramatic temperature variations in Central America on Sunday are a great example.
There was a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and Des Moines, Iowa and St. Louis.
Over the next few days, the long-lasting summer temperature will re-emerge and try to spread.
Moderate temperatures are expected over much of the central and eastern United States in October, from the southern plains into parts of the northeast in the 80s.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that temperatures are likely to be much above average for the first half of October in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, across six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, without airing regular events for a last-minute twist on Friday: Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake signed a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee with 100 percent certainty that Kavanaugh had caught himself drinking at a high school party and had tried to take off his clothes.
I'm 100 per cent sure that won't happen.
More than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen said.
Average people watched on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network that aired it, were not immediately available.
Nielsen usually has some problems with measuring the number of people in the office.
It was the size of an audience visiting a playoff football match or an Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, thus garnering an average of 5.69 million viewers more than all of the networks during the one-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
There was a lot of interest after the meeting.
He played a key role in Friday's game.
After the neutral Republican office issued a statement saying that Flack was in favor of Kavanaugh, he was mocked by protesters in the presence of CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to go to the elevator for a hearing by a judicial panel on Friday morning.
He was arrested after being interviewed for several hours by the local television station.
I told her I was standing in front of her.
Do you think he is telling the truth?
He said, “There are a lot of women out there who are like you.
Flake said his office had released the report and that he would say more in the committee investigation before the elevator was shut down.
While the entire Senate voted on Kavanaugh's nomination before the judicial system voted, the cable and broadcast networks all recorded it live.
But Flack said he did so knowing that the FBI, which the minority Democrats insist on, would look into the allegations against the candidate next week.
Flake was pacified by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flack made his decision.
Flake's decision had value, as it was clear that Republicans would have no votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered an investigation by the FBI into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "politicising" Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her intention to leave the EU were "politicizing" Britain's future and undermining national interest.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In an interview next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson said the proposal by Britain and the EU to charge each other's tariffs was "totally bogus" and attacked the checkers' plan for Brexit.
Vade Sims shooting case: LSU sportsman Titan Simpson charged with murder
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims of LSU.
The Baden Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Titan Simpson has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had missed his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police found Simpson's DNA in the glass found from the scene.
After questioning Simpson, he confessed to the killing.
His contract was set at $350,000.
The office of the East Baden Rouge Parish Coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday in which it was stated that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck from the head.
The department also commends the Louisiana State Police's Fleeing Task Force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and the public for helping with the investigation to arrest the perpetrator.
LSU athletics director Joe Allewa thanked law enforcement for "persistently defending justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
Baden grew up 6-foot-6 in Ruge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "stuck" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
He says he's worried about it all the time.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash emitted from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Mitigation Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after observing an event at the mouth of the volcano, recording 183 gas and ash leaks in 24 hours.
There were a lot of interruptions and interruptions in the process.
Photos have been shown on social media of scattered thin ash flakes on top of car windshields in Mexico City's neighborhoods, such as Sociomilco.
In September 2017, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico, geophysicists have detected excess emissions from a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, known as "Don Koyo," has been erupting since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists during Independence Day celebrations.
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona after pro-liberation protesters clashed with police and thousands joined an opposition rally marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's breakout vote.
The masked separatist support of beating eggs, throwing powdered paint, causing mud in the streets, and mixing with tourists
Later in the day, clashes broke out when the police started using lathis.
The protesters chanted "Long live Spain" against the slogan "We will not forget, we will not forgive" raised by pro-liberation groups for hours.
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protest.
Tensions were high in the liberated zone a year after Madrid outlawed the October 1 Referendum, although separatist Catalans celebrated it.
Those who opposed separatism declined to vote, but there were those who actively voted for independence.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop polling stations in violence zones.
Pro-freedom groups had camped out all night on Friday to block a demonstration in support of the police.
Although the demonstration took place, it was forced to take place in another way.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, joined his wife in a secessionist protest. He no longer believed in the liberation of Catalonia.
We had our best year last year.
"We saw the joy our parents had about voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
The Catalan Emancipation Pro-Democracy parties are struggling to keep up this year's moment with the top leaders who are under house arrest, even though they have managed to hold important ones despite last year's regional elections in December.
42-year-old Mechanic John Puig, who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the issue had been raised by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more difficult," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, a Catalan leader who has been awaiting sentencing since late last year, said he would take part in the next European Parliament elections.
He said that contesting the European elections was the only way to do without the democratic values and repression of the Spanish state.
Londoner: The men were arrested after the car hit the house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested in Londonerry for crashing a car into a house.
The incident was reported at Ballingert Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Deputy Inspector Bob Flemings said there was damage to the door and the building.
At one point, the car could have been hit.
In the case of Menga Strike Rangers, Livingston won 1-0.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> Menga's first goal for Livingstone was a victory.
Livingston surprised Rangers by handing over Steven Gerrard to fix his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
In moving with Gary Holt's Hyperion, Dolly Menga's strike has proved to be different.
Gerrard, who won the season's premiership, wins the hearts of the leaders, with eight points going forward next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Since replacing Kenny Miller last month, with head coach Holt without a defeat, Livingston has extended his unbeaten run to six games in a row.
Livingston missed out on a chance against Blond visitors.
Holt's team should have been ahead of the Rangers before scoring with their straightforwardness, which causes all kinds of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson kept his efforts ahead of goal, and then was able to give Alan Lithgow an interview with Craig Halkett during the goal.
Knowing that visiting sets can be a nuisance, the hosts agree to play Rangers in front of them.
That was the main goal.
The Rangers agreed to a free kick and to start Livingston's inning, Teclan Gallagher and Robinson Touche set up Menga who scored from the center of the box.
At the same stage, the Rangers dominated but were unable to penetrate the home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unfazed.
Although Alfredo Morelos insisted on a presence, from Kelly, the organization continued in the second half.
Although Scott Pittman was denied by the Rangers goalkeeper Alan McCreager, Lidgow offered him another Livingstone set in the game.
Even after the transfer of player Glenn Middleton's Halkets challenge, the two penalties, one for the handball, continued to cross the Livingston Box and continued to be removed.
A Distinction from Livingston - Study
Tony Macaroni at the Arena, BBC Alastair Lamont of Scotland
It's a unique place to live in Kingston.
For one, they continue to push expectations on this forward journey.
After returning to top flight, their playing style and personnel have also changed a bit, but all credit must go to Holt, who has designed the team since his arrival.
He has many heroes.
Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Vorrell on the watch while Captain Halket looked at the defence, which was very well integrated.
The Rangers, however, were less impressed.
Even though they were well below Gerard's level, they were in a low position to the standards.
Their last ball was stuck. once they opened the home page, it was a wake-up lesson for those who felt themselves in the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception at the Cologny
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders had a meeting for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to normalize relations between NATO allies.
They were out of action on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to open the largest new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police reportedly made elaborate security arrangements to prevent more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters gathered in the nearby area to see their leader.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - raised their voices in protest of Erdogan's policies calling for the country and the German state's decision.
He is also celebrated by some German people as a hero, while others refer to him as a tyrant.
Car-bike mishap : Critically injured bike rider succumbs
He died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 BST on the busy Deptford Road, at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in the south-east of London.
The driver tried to stop the car, but the other person managed to escape.
The accident took place a few months ago on Childers Road, about a mile away, after a cyclist was hit and killed.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities were currently trying to locate the victims' relatives and take stock of the situation.
The road was closed and buses were diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area where the incident took place.
Long Lord's jail: Six officers injured in rioting
According to prison officials, six prison officials were injured in the attack on the high-security prison.
Riots at Long Lord's prison in Wargastershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday are still ongoing.
Toronto special officers were called in to quell the riot, and eight of the rioters were found and placed in solitary confinement.
The injured officers were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison area said: "Specially trained prison officers have been deployed to control the riots currently taking place at the HMP Long Lord's prison.
Six of the injured are being treated.
We cannot tolerate the violence in our prisons and the police will find the perpetrators and extend their jail term."
The HMP Long Lord's prison can house up to 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the governor of the prison was allegedly beaten up by one of the inmates and taken to hospital.
In October last year, anti-riot officers were called in for assaulting workers with pool balls and the riots were put down.
The sudden flooding caused by Hurricane Rosa has affected Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City. (Dry areas may benefit)
It is difficult to reach Arizona due to the tropical rainstorm, but it is likely to happen early next week as there is a risk of sudden flooding across the southwest desert due to the residual power of Cyclone Rosa.
The National Weather Service has begun monitoring flash flooding in parts of western Arizona, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, from southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah.
Cyclone Rosa will cross the Phoenix area in a straight line on Tuesday, causing rain showers earlier in the afternoon on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only ten tropical cyclones have caused tropical storms or low pressure conditions within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) formed within 40 miles of the AZ border.
Recent models from the National Hurricane Center have predicted 2 to 4 inches of rain in the Mogollon rim region in Arizona, and up to 6 inches in some isolated places.
Other parts of the Desert Southwest region comprising the Central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to receive rainfall ranging from 1 to 2 inches and up to 4 inches at some isolated places.
In areas where there is no risk of sudden floods, the rainfall caused by Cyclone Rosa can be beneficial as they were affected by drought.
Though flooding is a serious problem, it is likely to bring benefits in some areas. The Southwest is currently reeling under drought.
According to the U.S. Trot Monitor report, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, which is the second highest category, according to Weather.com.
Originally, the route of Hurricane Rosa was just along the coast of Baja California, Mexico.
Cyclone Rosa made landfall in Mexico's Punto Egina, 385 miles south, with winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning and a speed of 12 miles per hour north.
The storm drains cold water into the Pacific and then weakens.
It is expected to make landfall in Mexico as a severe tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
There is a risk of heavy rain and flooding in some areas around Mexico.
According to Weather.com, Baja California to Sonora in the northwest are likely to receive 3 to 6 inches of rain and 10 inches of rain
It will then move northward as a tropical storm until Rosa Mexico before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday.
The National Hurricane Center said the main damage from Rosa or the rest of it would be heavy rainfall over Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the US Desert Southwest.
The rain causes life - threatening flooding, dust storms in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Four arrested for attempted murder in Midsomer North
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Somerset on charges of attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy by inflicting severe knife wounds.
The teenager was found dead in the Excelsior area of Midsomer Norton at around 4pm BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was declared brought dead.
Police said four people were arrested at the same time - a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man - in the Ratstag area, Avon and Somerset.
The authorities asked them to provide mobile video evidence showing what happened to anyone.
Trump calls Kavanaugh's 'fakeness' of the Democratic Party a sign of anger
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, Trump said the vote for Justice Kavanaugh would be a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthlessness and ferocious tactics.
Trump said the Democratic Party's mercilessness throughout his petition process was a sign of anger.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically and passionately denying the allegations that he and Christine Blasley Ford sexually assaulted him when he was a teen several years ago.
He also testified against Ford.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's intelligence, quality, and courage that day.
He told a crowd of West Virginia sources that a vote was needed to confirm Kavanaugh, one of the legal judges of our time and one of the most accomplished in public service.
The President has indirectly stated that the importance of the Republican Party will change in the by-elections due to Kavanaugh's petition.
“One of the most important elections of our lives is going to be in five weeks.
"I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
That's why I fight for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that the Democrats were aiming to "resist and deter."
A senior aide to the GOP leadership told CNN that the first formal vote on Kavanaugh's nomination was expected to be placed on the Senate floor before Friday.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continues to rise.
At least 384 people were killed when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of them thrown overboard by a giant wave, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday, more than a hundred people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Balu, and waves of more than six metres (18 feet) began to blow up in the evening, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The quake was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugarho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said in Jakarta that when the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, many of the workers on the beach were dead because they did not immediately escape.
Ngueraho said cars and houses were swept away by the tsunami and hit everything on the shore. He added that the speed of the tsunami was 800 kph (497 mph) at sea before it reached the coast.
He said some of the people had fallen from the trees.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Balu.
The agency released aerial photographs of dilapidated buildings, shops, collapsed bridges and water-logged mosques.
The aftermath of Saturday's attacks continues to affect the coastal city.
The earthquake was felt by 2.4 million people.
The earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II, Indonesia's Assessment and Technology Input Agency (BPPT) said in a statement.
According to the report, the city's geographical location along the long narrow ocean line may have widened the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and restaurants had been destroyed.
He said 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing, while the bodies of the victims were buried in the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
Tongla, the epicentre of the earthquake, is 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Balu.
Nugroho said there was a "total sixties of communication" in Tongla.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
This is a major damage, but it could be worse, the report said.
The agency was criticised on Saturday for not reporting the Bali tsunami, even though officials had warned of the waves.
In a video shared on social media, a man standing at the top of a building shouted tsunami warnings to people on the street.
Within a few minutes, large waves came to the shore and swept into buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
Power outages caused by the earthquake and tsunami disrupted communication and made it difficult for the officer to coordinate in the area around Balu.
Officials said the victims were provided with food and basic necessities, even though they were being transported by cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities.
The city's airport, which is open only for relief, will remain closed until the end of October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the relief camps in Balu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
This is very bad.
Mr. Tosepha said that although the World Vision workers from Donggala travelled safely to Balu and the workers were staying in tarpaulin huts at the Baluvil office hall, they informed about the damages on the way.
He said he saw a lot of houses destroyed.
This is very bad.
Some have accused the aid teams of carrying out full-scale relief work, but experienced foreign aid volunteers have been prevented from travelling to Balu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial aid and supplies from abroad can only enter the country if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasnt happened yet.
Aliya Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said it was still a provincial-level damage.
Yes, we can get international help the minute the government declares it's a national disaster, but it hasn't happened yet.
On the second night of Balu after the earthquake and tsunami, families and friends searching for their missing loved ones felt the pain of natural disasters.
On Friday, a man was pulled from the water.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who was trapped near her mother's body amid the rubble of the building.
The Indonesian national, Genton Subandano, has coached two missing paragliders at the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
All of them, including Mr. Roe, were students of the Roe Roe School.
As a veteran of the paragliding industry, I feel very strongly about it.
As soon as he got the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa restaurant in the paragliding community, he recalled how he sent WhatsApp messages to the Balu contestants at the beach festival.
Instead of using the blue color, they just use the blue color.
I thought the news didn't reach them.
The thieves stole $26,750 while filling the ATM at Newport, Levie.
According to a report by Newport Police, the thieves had stolen $26750 when Breing's employee filled out an ATM in Newport, Levie, on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was in the process of clearing the ATM from the premises and filling it with cash.
While he was doing the work, the money that was to be filled was stolen from the back of the Brink's servant.
According to the report, many people saw the incident as suspicious, but the exact number of people involved is not yet known.
If anyone has information about the identity of the thieves, contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap singer changed his name to Yeh
Rap singer Kanye West changed his name to "Yay."
He wrote that he announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday: he is commonly known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West was for a time known by his nickname Yeh, which was the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The name change was announced on Saturday afternoon, at a time when West's new album Yanti was expected to be released.
The show's director said that the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show due to emotional reasons, is being transferred.
West said it was a shortened version of the current nickname, keeping it as a name of religious significance for him.
"Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and "Ye" means "You," West said when speaking to Bigboy Radio presenter about the album's title.
So, I'm you. I'm me.
That's the reason for the y-vag from Kanye. It's about our goodness, evil, confusion and everything else.
This book is all about each of us.
He was one of the first rock singers to change his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Even JAY-Z, a former West partner, changed his name to Hyphen and, if not, to Capital Letter.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use military force against its citizens.
Mexican President Andres Andres has said he will not use military force against civilians as the country marks the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador said on Saturday that he would "not use military force against the people of Mexico."
As left-wing student movements took root across Latin America, at one point on October 2, 1968, forces held a peace rally for the killing of 300 people.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador said he would give a monthly grant to students and support the Mexican people to set up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities connect students with the criminal gangs.
America, A.I. needs to double down.
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and A.I. practitioner, and who has worked at Google, Apple and Microsoft, said the United States should double its research efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
Even though the formal A.I. strategy is limited to the United States, many parts of the U.S. government began to come to the fore when A.I. announcements were made.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: it plans to become the No. 1 in A.I. innovations by 2030.
While other countries lag far behind the US, a review of the A.I. would be a good start to double the budget and we look forward to that, Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said the doubling of funding would also double the chances of America's AI achievements.
However, Lee's book: China Face<0x2B><0x2B> was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the top AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University, a former AI organization of the American elite, and was executive at Microsoft and head of Google's China division.
Lee also recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the robotics challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, as a way to identify the next visionaries.
Lee said U.S. scientists need to work harder to get government subsidies.
China is not taking the best of education, corporates are taking the best.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been taking intellectuals from universities to work in AI.
Lee said even a change in immigration policies would help American Boulster in AI efforts.
"I think every doctoral degree holder in AI should have a green card of their own," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"China's National Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to educational institutions, just as the National Institute of Science and other government agencies provide funding to US researchers,"" Li said."
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense launched a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to recruit partners from companies and academic institutions. The White House unveiled the creation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment this month in an initiative called AI Next.
Like NSF, AI is currently investing $100 million a year in research.
The U.S. National Security Commission's request for artificial intelligence has been pending for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to rename the "Republic of North Macedonia" as a possible solution to a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership in the EU and NATO.
Kreis, a province of Macedonia, and the northern named region of Macedonia continue to exercise their authority and register their entry into NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition argues that the name change would deprive the Slavic majority of Macedonia of the strength of their ethnic identity.
"President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and that the boycott campaign questioned whether there would be a 50-per cent turnout to allow the vote to be valid."""
According to the poll ballot question: Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership in accord with the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the renaming, including Prime Minister Zoran Jeev, argued that one of the developing countries from the Yugoslav disintegration was right to grant access to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia.
I have come to vote for the future of the country, I have come to vote for young people, and they have to live freely under the EU because that is safe for all of us, said Olivera Georgiovska, 79, from Skopje.
The majority of MPs said they would vote on whether the decision was legal or not.
The name change would require the support of two-thirds of MPs.
The State Election Commission (SEC) said there were no violations of the rules till 1 pm.
However, the turnout was 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election, where 16.66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
I came to vote for my children. The place we live is Europe, said Jose Denowski, a 62-year-old voter from Skopje, a voter of the capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Jeev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on September 30, 2018, in support of a name change that would pave the way for the EU and NATO to join forces.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was putting up chairs in front of tents arranged by some who boycotted the vote.
We will be for NATO and the EU, but not through the service gate, Kavtarkov said.
Ours is a poor but self-respecting country.
If they don't want to join our country, they can join countries like China and Russia and join EuroAsia.
Prime Minister Jeev said that with more than 20 percent unemployment, at least a NATO member would bring more investment to Macedonia.
After casting his vote, Prime Minister Jeev said he was confident that more than 80 percent of our citizens would support the EU and NATO.
The "yes" vote will determine the future of our country.
Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said Monday that only 30 to 43 percent of the votes would be counted, which is less than the required percentage.
Another poll conducted by Delma, Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Forty-seven percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful, a candidate needs to get 50 per cent votes.
If the referendum fails, Western support for the government, which began in May last year, will fall sharply.
Note: The entire Brighton defence travelled for the Sergio Aguero goal in Manchester City.
In England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling opened the scoring for Brighton Defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
It seemed like a good idea to take the 65-minute mark.
Argentinian striker in midfield at the beginning of the area received that sanction.
He raced between the three Breton defenders before coming to the open field.
He was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
At the end of the day, Britton pushed a defender before the end of the box.
He looked to his left and saw the sledgehammer.
The English forward hit first into the box when he returned the ball to Ekuro, who hit Breton keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Acuro was having some trouble with his leg.
We're talking about a player who played 55, 60 minutes.
Thats what has happened.
We were fortunate to have him on board at the time.

Cerser thinks of playing spoiler. Rakizu
The Nationals were stripped of the playoff and there was no reason to start another one.
The winner, Cerser, was hoping to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies had play-off entries for a game above the NL West's Los Angeles Dodgers.
The rookies picked up at least one wild-card spot with a 5-2 win in the Nationals on Friday night. But they are still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can control the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the rest of the team will play at the highest level of any point I face this year."
Why don’t I want to fight?”
The Nationals have not yet announced Sunday's starter, but in such an environment, it depends on the pitcher.
Cerser will pitch on Sunday and make his 34th start in the bullpen session on Thursday.
Washington's right-hander 18/7 with 220 2/3 innings, 300 strikeouts and 2.53 ERA this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican turn in the Midterm Elections, the President mentioned the situation of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
We ended up doing it in November.
We are just five weeks away from the big election.
"It's so big, I'm not running but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm fighting for bigger candidates," he said.
"You're looking at the Progressive Democrats, you're looking at what's going on," Trump continued.
They are using something to try to take back their posts. You see the bad behavior.
They do not know whom we are persecuting and whom we are depriving of power. They only have power, and we are not giving it to them."
Speaking of the Democrats, he said, "They're going to lose."
For the past four days, he has been talking about Democrats as "angry, dishonest, and worse."
One thing that has received a great deal of uproar from the audience is that the Democratic Senate of the Senate Judicial Committee named and referred to Tien Feinstein.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you get rid of the document?
Whoa, whoa.
No, no, it's a really bad physiognomy. It's the worst physiognomy I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a political party.
The speaker can't make up his mind.
To denounce me, the Momentum activists in my party voted, which was really surprising.
I was one of the few people who said they didn't want to talk about it.
This was also the case with my parliamentary friend, John Ryan, for his unhesitating voice against racial discrimination against the Jewish people.
I was reprimanded for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy Corbyn has been at loggerheads with previous leaders over issues such as responsible economic policy and national security in Europe.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting, published on Friday, said: "We expect the meetings to be cordial and constructive."
That’s what most of the GC meetings on Friday night would be like in my eight years of local Labour MP experience.
But today, there is no tone like in many meetings, and the kind and gentle politics that has ever begun seems to be long forgotten.
It is obvious that the Labour Party cannot tolerate differing opinions, and each opinion is decided by the leadership of the party.
This occurred shortly after Jeremy became president, and the people with whom I shared similar political ideas expected me to take positions that I did not like.
Whenever I speak in public - no matter what I say to them - I get wrongly criticised on social media for my lack of choice, for my political standing, and for the fact that I don't belong in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I consider myself lucky when I consider the denunciations made against me as compared to those who work with me.
I am amazed at the people who work with me and despite their daily sexual and racial slurs, they are firm and professional and have never wavered.
One of the most important aspects of this era is the simple fact of life.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party needed to develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is, we are no longer multi-faceted, as the party begins to shrink because of every unsteady act or change in the election.
For the past two years, I've had a lot of people tell me that if I don't do something, I'm going to get in trouble and I'm going to get out of it.
But I am not here for politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student when my extensive school classroom collapsed because of the Thatcher government's neglect. I decided at that time that I wanted to serve the people in need, whether it was as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I didn't even vote in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is confused about my political line, but they do not agree with the current leadership.
I want to tell the selectors on Friday that if the country moves towards Brexit, families, businesses and our public services will be affected.
I have a message to give to the people of my constituency, not to Nottingham Momentum, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you.
MP for Nottingham East, Chris Leslie
Ayr 38 team <0xE2><0x80><0x93> 17 Melrose team <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Undefeated Ayr team, top of the table.
Although the final results of the last two attempts have changed, there is no doubt that the winner of this magnificent Tennent Premiership is the team of Ayr.
They are in the top of the league with a losing record.
With their excellent blocking, the team had a chance to win, and coach Peter Mursi was delighted.
"We are a team that can't be beaten by the quality we've shown in our games so far, so I'm happy I can be."
"""Congratulations to the Ayr team, they took advantage of the opportunity given to us,"" Melrose's Robin Christie said."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute effort saw Eyre take the lead as Frazier was beaten by Clemson. The yellow card for Rory Hawks, wearing a Scotland cap, changed the course of the game for the Warriors.
Gilimo took a penultimate lead for Eyre, scoring 17-5 during the break.
Melrose, however, started well in the second half, and Pagat foiled Patrick Andersen's bid, dropping five points to Leavitt.
A serious injury to Ruarith Natt resulted in a long break and was carried off the stretcher. Eyre was in the lead in the re-started match with an effort by Stanford McDowell, but was turned back by Klimov.
Later, Iyer's charge was shown a yellow card to captain Blair McPheeerson. Once again, the effort of Bruce Calvin was thwarted by extra-soldiers who tried to stop the Melbourne team at the end of a tense spell.
The local team recovered, however, and McPheeerson was shown a yellow card for Klimo as the penalty took him out without a ball being bowled.
Gilimo was once again blocked from resuming the game. David Armstrong-in-the-box kicks against Kyle Rowe prevented the local team's fifth attempt with Gregor Henry's flanker position.
The still-cam actor is about to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
The actor is likely to join the entertainment industry after being appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company by Ford.
The popular BBC show was written by 56-year-old Jack Jarvis and co-starred with long-time comedy partner Craig Hempel.
The duo announced the upcoming ninth series, which will be the last series and will be directed by Kiernan, who will be moving to a different field of life after Greaiklang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adreftmarn Ltd.
The Scottish Sun newspaper reported that Kiernan would be involved in Glasgow's successful restaurant business, but actor Kiernan declined to comment.
Sea Namaday: The land-locked Bolivia hopes the court will re-open the path to the Pacific.
The Marines patrolled the Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flag flies in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the slogan asks at naval bases: "The ocean is our right.
It is our duty to restore it."
Across landlocked Bolivia, Chile lost its coast in a bloody 19th-century riot. However, it is eager to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
Bolivia is awaiting an international court ruling on October 1, five years after the deliberations.
Bolivia has elements of unity and peace, with good results, said the Bolivian scholar Roberto Callasadillah.
"Many policemen will see the International Court of Justice (ICJ) declaration on big screens all over the country. The tribunal in The Hague is expected to act in Bolivia's favour.
Bolivia's charismatic president, Evo Morales, is due to face re-election next year, and he is awaiting Monday's ruling.
In August, he vowed to get closer to the Pacific Ocean.
Some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolia, but will change some things.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to determine the Chilean border, and has agreed not to decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ICJ's decision comes only six months after the last arguments were heard, said Paszaradey, a Chilean expert on international law.
The last four years may have been backward due to an undeveloped Bolivia.
Zardey accused the current Bolivian government of blocking the way to the sea.
He opined that the reputation of the rest of Chile was saved by Morales' combative ability.
Bolivia and Chile will start talks on the same point, but it will be very difficult to continue discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Weltsche rejected the idea, saying in The Hague that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
On Monday, Chile will begin a new relationship with the United States, which will benefit both sides as long as the 139-year-old dispute is resolved.
Galzadilla has denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most famous presidents, is now using the maritime crisis as a political stepping stone.
He also said that Bolivia would not relinquish its right to claim the Pacific Ocean.
It is an opportunity to relive the past.
North Korea says it can't stop an attack until it has confidence in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said his country would not take any action until Washington agreed to a cease-fire.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
Among the opposition leaders, he called on the US to follow through on the promises made at the summit in Singapore.
With North Korea's Kim Jong Un, three months after the Singapore summit, the secretary of state Mike Pompeo's nuclear problem is on a near-completed level.
Ree said that the continued sanctions and the US objection to the end of the Korean War were a "pipe dream" for the North.
Washington has been wary of pledging without Pyongyang taking the first steps toward a major ceasefire.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
But there is one thing that is questionable, and Pyongyang says the only way out is to abandon the arsenal for the country's security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month for a second Kim-Trump summit preparations.
Paris fashion reveals the latest trend of headwear, on the way to the high street near you.
Even if you want to add a bunch of your hats and hide them completely from the sun, you don't need to go anywhere else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown released a collection of the biggest hats for their SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
This summer, the most rare hats were posted on Instagram, and designers introduced their eye-catching items.
The best creation of Valentino is the beige cap that adorns the head of the models.
Ornamental watermelons, visor hat and pineapple are other large-scale ornaments, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Brown also released a set of different masks on Halloween.
There were many colorful masks that had lips that looked more like a henibal lectern than a hot gown.
There was something like a melted ice cream cone, and something like a scuba diving gear that matched the slogger and Google.
If you're a fan of this great country, you're in luck.
They say that the best way to get to the top of the mountain is to walk around the mountains near you.
From Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski, the big cap comes in La Bomba with a two-legged prism that is visible to everyone.
The label behind the much-popular rare cap also posted another one on social media. A model wearing a swimsuit, holding a straw beech bag, was also released.
At Paris Fashion Week, Jacquemus'La Riviera will be in the SS19 collection, the best known is the Burnt Orange Rafia Pie with Rafia Fringinge with a white leather handle.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect the next summer to have big hats and beach bags. The designer has such an impact that it will be inevitable to avoid big ornaments on a large scale.'
John Edwards: Global Citizens Must Have Language
Scotland’s independent schools consistently deliver the best education, with individual and team sports, art, music and other social activities, and the best school outcomes in 2018.
With 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Federation of Independent Schools, provide excellent service to students and their parents.
Independent schools not only prepare their students for the best of higher education, but also create their careers and pave the way for them to become global citizens.
When a school's design and procedures are developed as an academic discipline, new languages become popular and a favorite choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If a man speaks to him in a language he understands, it reaches his intellect.
It speaks to his heart in his own language.
It is a strong reminder that English alone cannot be relied upon to build relationships and gain trust from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that there are language lessons within independent schools with the highest selection rates.
A total of 68 per cent students who studied foreign languages received an A grade.
According to data from SCIS's 74 member schools, 72 per cent of students in Mandarin received a top grade A, with 72 per cent of students studying German, 69 per cent of students studying French and 63 per cent of students studying Spanish.
This means that Scotland's independent schools are teaching children and young adults key skills in foreign languages that are undoubtedly needed.
In schools with independent curriculums, language is seen as the main subject (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as in STEM subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of job seekers reported language impairment.
Therefore, language skills are very important for future career prospects.
In a globalized world, language skills are essential for better job opportunities that require languages.
It can be a life-long skill that will help you if you choose any career, learn a second language.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically lead to success in a person who knows many languages.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 UK youth in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language fluently, while 15 percent were able to speak only French.
This is why education is so important for today's youth.
Along with multiple languages, in emerging economic situations, this system will prepare the children for meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school differs in the languages they teach.
While many schools are aiming to learn new languages, other schools have expressed a desire to teach Mandarin, such as Japanese, languages that will be key to the UK in 2020.
Whatever your child's preference, there will be plenty of languages to learn in independent schools, and there will be teachers who specialize in that field.
Scotland's independent schools provide an environment that enables them to develop skills and competencies that will help them in the future.
There is no denying the fact that language is important for the development of the country and the global business environment, and therefore, it should be reflected in education as well.
Modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independence schools offer this opportunity and give Scotland's young people the diversity and talent they need to succeed.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Scottish Federation of Independent Schools
Le Braun Creates Lakers to Start Sunday in San Diego
For the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is over as fans wait to see Le Braun James make his first start.
In San Diego, Lakers coach Luke Walden announced that James will play in Sunday's Preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets.
It remains to be seen how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than a minute and less than 48 minutes," Walden said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudel tweeted that James would play for a limited number of minutes.
Upon completion of training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason timeline.
"There's no need for any pre-requisite to step foot in this phase of my life," he said.
Trump's campaign time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight's campaign conferences in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be Trump's first of five conventions scheduled for next week, including places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With Republicans at risk of losing congressional support during a November vote, Trump is aiming to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, with a vote temporarily suspended to confirm who he'll choose to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.
What time is Trump's West Virginia convention tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia convention is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
Trump's West Virginia convention can be seen live on YouTube at the link below.
Trump plans to postpone a Senate confirmation vote by a week this week to bring to light the sexual assault allegations that are under investigation by the FBI.
But the primary purpose of these conventions is to rally support for Republicans running in November's election.
"These five conferences of President Trump next week are "aimed at energizing volunteers and supporters in their efforts to protect and expand the Republican majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Congress's control is very important to him, so the president will travel to as many states as possible in these working environments," a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The rally, scheduled at the Wespanco Arena in Wheeling, "may draw on information from the Pittsburgh media with supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania," according to the West Virginia Metro news department.
This Saturday, Trump will travel to West Virginia for the second time in the past month, the state that won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to rally support for West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morris, who is trailing in the election.
According to Reuters, "It's not good for the president to be in a position to increase his vote count," said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: US men's singles final to be played on Sunday
After three head-to-head matches, the four-team contest on Saturday afternoon is likely to provide the much-needed anticipation for the Ryder Cup.
Swinging Pentium is a single-player, single-player game, and there are no competitors.
What do you think the opportunities are now?
"They were six points ahead, but now it's up to four points, so now we have a little bit of opportunity," said Jordan Spieth.
With 12 games still to go, the Europa League team is four points ahead, so they have a lot of chances.
As Spieth has said, the Americans have little chance on their side, and both Spieth and Justin Thomas have scored three points each in the four matches they have played, so they have a lot of work to do to encourage them.
Spieth, who was the front-runner for the field, has been ruled out of De Tou Green.
There was a lot of celebration during his round, with him and Thomas scoring at a rate of two per side, with butts in all four corners.
There was also a huge celebration on the 15th, which meant that the Americans deserved the victory.
"You're very passionate about your game," he said.
All the players are now gone.
They have 18 points to win.
Only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days of the Ryder Cup's undisputed experience.
Europe's best-kept secret is 4.
The pair who didn’t get “Bogie” on Saturday afternoon were only “Mollywood”, but they missed the Mokies on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon. Then got nine points again on Friday morning.
Their wit and ability enthralled the audience, and they won on Sunday, showing Fleetwood or Molinari, and famous players who could attest to Europe's success during the Lee Golf Nationale decision.
Both of them got points at the same time on different strategies.
Europe's success is to be applauded, but it must be spoken about.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson along with Alex Noronha played very sharp in Sergio Garcia and got four balls in the morning.
The bogey and front nine duck were the ladder to victory for the Spanish and Americans.
No one will help you get points on Sunday.
It was a pleasure to see Forbal and Forsyth up close to see the couple's understanding, the way of counseling, and the immediate strategy shift.
The European team has played well so far, especially on the final day, but this foursome round has undoubtedly benefited the U.S. team because of its quality of play.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, the Europa League is leading 10-6
The Europa League team is off to a healthy start on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 scoreline against the United States of America of a four-game and four-game tournament on Saturday.
The inspirational duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari are leading the table with two wins against Tiger Woods and four points from the Li Golf National Tournament so far.
Thomas Jordon's European team, to retain the trophy they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the four-ball match in the morning to take the series 3-1.
The U.S. men's team faced stiff opposition in a four-man series, winning two matches, but were unable to level the points.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European player to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari became known as "Mollywood" after a busy weekend, only the second pair to win four points in four consecutive matches since the opening match of the Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match, they beat Woods and the U.S. Rookie Bryson Decampo with a further solid 5&4.
Woods, who made slow progress until two matches on Saturday, showed spontaneity from time to time, but now he has lost seven consecutive matches in four-ball and four-man competitions and has lost 19 of his 29 matches so far.
Justine Rose, resting in a four-ball match in the morning, then teamed up with Henrik Stenson at Forbes to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the top-three finishers globally, by 2&1.
Despite the pleasant sunny day in southwestern Paris, Europe did not take it for granted.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points in the contest on Saturday.
They won the four-ball match by 2&1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Boulder and then beat Boulder and Rory McIlroy 4&3 after losing two points in the opening game.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team progressed from a four-point deficit to the singles division, although Furyk's squad would only need to equalize if they were to retain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, the counter-attack given by them on Sunday appears to have turned out to be an unexpected turn of events.
North Korea says 'no way' it will unilaterally disarm
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions was eroding his confidence in the United States and that the country had no choice but to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Mr Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had carried out "significant goodwill actions" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling its nuclear test site, and pledging not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not received any response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States as to their national security, we are left with no choice but to unilaterally put ourselves first in situations like these."
While Ri repeated North Korea's usual complaints of Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to denuclearization (remarkably because of North Korea's step-by-step approach), his statement appeared to be significant because it did not rule out unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, which Trump said guaranteed North Korea's security and promised to work towards "the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. says Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed calls for the easing of tougher international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US is increasing the level of opposition to sanctions in order to achieve its policy of ""first and foremost abdication of nuclear weapons"" and is ""resisting the declaration of the end of the war."""
"It's a dream come true for those of us who don't know how to make money.
But the problem is that continued economic sanctions only exacerbate our distrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for a summit between Kim and Trump at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and said: "The reason for this nuclear arms denuclearization problem is not the United States, but South Korea, so there will be no opposition to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
Ri's voice was quite different from last year when he said that North Korea's rockets targeted the U.S. House of Representatives in Mainland after President Evil called Kim the "rocket man" of the suicide bombing.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for showing courage in taking action at the United Nations this year to disarm, but also said more work, such as sanctions, must be done until North Korea gives up nuclear weapons completely.
On Wednesday, Trump said there were no deadlines and "it could take two years, three years, or five months, and it's not going to be a problem."
China and Russia have said that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang's action.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of sanctions and the abandonment of nuclear weapons must continue until they are seriously, fully and finally verified."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to stem funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Riv alone during the United Nations General Assembly, and then he said he would travel again to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, claiming that action had been taken to denounce "authority demands" within hours of his departure for North Korea.
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month that it would dismantle the missile site and the nuclear complex if the United States took "relevant measures."
He said he had told Kim that the "relevant measures" would be the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new curriculum introduced at Harvard University this year allows undergraduates to get more sleep, partly in response to a growing culture of binge drinking and sleeping 'all night'.
One academic found that students at the world's top-quality university don't seem to have much in the way of clues when it comes to how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Sessler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who believes it was the first such course designed in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of the conversation, a woman came up to me and said, 'Why is this being told to me only in this year when my education is about to end?'
"No one has ever told me about the importance of sleep," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which has been launched for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits help education and athletic performance, and how they improve their general well-being.
Paul Pareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the curriculum after finding that students were actively losing sleep over the course of the week.
The course is one hour long and includes a series of interactive activities.
A section has an image of a dorm room where they click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to tell students about the effects of caffeine and light on how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of maintaining the routine of bedtime.
In another section, it tells participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with symbols that influence each other encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"It doesn't change the behavior of the students."
But we believe they have the right to know - and you have the right to know the health consequences of choosing to smoke a cigarette."
There is still a culture of pride in 'pulling the all-nighter,' he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students with sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep, ensuring a good quality of sleep, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as insomnia keeps the brain in hunger mode, creating them constantly hungry.
Raymond Cho, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped design Professor Chesler's curriculum and took one of his classes in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to a campus-level course.
As the next step, he hopes to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar course of study before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Prof. Sessler suggested that students should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed and when to get up, and be aware of the harmful effects of <0xE2><0x80><0x98>blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LED lights on the rhythm outside the gilder, leading to problems in sleep.
Livingston Rangers 1-0: Menga's goal brought Gerrard's team down
It was another sad day for Rangers as Steven Gerrard's unaffiliated side suffered a 1-0 defeat at Livingston due to Dolly Meng's strike.
The Ibrox side tried to record their first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone on February 1, but the runaway Ladbrokes Premiership had to let the manager keep eight points from their side of the leaders' hearts, as Gary Holt's side suffered a second defeat in Gerrard's 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers were less motivated as they didn't know they could equalize.
With the Rangers currently relegated to sixth place, Livingston moved up to third, with a goal difference for them to reach the Hybernians.
The Rangers may have had a further problem after lineman Carl Spence was treated for a head injury for deliberately throwing an object from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which sent the Ayres into the Betfred Cup semi-finals as fast as possible.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livy 11, which received a point from Horst last week, who would have been delighted to see the way his well-drilled clothing kept their opponents from suffocating each time.
The Rangers may have dominated the scoring, but Livingstone scored the most with the ball he got.
Menga's first-ever lay-off, they should have scored two minutes when Scott Pittman was sent off with a goal scored by Allan MacGregor, but the midfielder struggled to pull off his big chance wide.
The deep Keegan Jacobs free-kick was found by Skipper Craig, but was only able to insert wide into the back post by his opponent, Alain Lithgow.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, it looked like they had a lot more to look forward to than their confidence in the game.
Alfredo Morlas strictly thought he should have been fined for a quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless had clashed, but the Colombians' appeals were dismissed by referee Steven Thompson.
Rangers only managed two first-half shots on target, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was obviously hampered by Lassana Coulibaly's hit on the head and a rough Ove Azaria's strike.
No one can deny that Livy's 34th-minute opener could have scored against the opposition, and they deserved it just for their underhandedness.
Once again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep set-piece of the Jacobs.
Scott Orfield didn't show any reaction when Deklan put the ball in the ring for Scott Robinson, and he was silent about taking Menga out for a simple decision.
Gerrard showed resistance at the break as he replaced Ryan Kent with Cooley, a change that had an almost immediate effect as the winger was putting the ball in the Marilas, but feeling overwhelmed, Kelly left his line and ran to stop it.
However, Livingston continued to impress them by playing the same game that Lithgow and Hulkett played, one after the other, for long distances.
Halt's team was able to carry the ball up to the finals, but McGregor did well in blocking Jacobs before taking the Lithgow ball from the corner.
Rangers, who replaced Glenn Middleton, requested another delay in the penalty as he had problems with Jacobs, but Thompson turned his face back.
Panchangam: Discovery of Keegar Gounder
Now let's start with the page "Sunday morning" of the alphabet: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, exactly... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Keeger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually gave the device the name Geiger Counter.
Geiger Gounder's discovery is one of the most important scientific achievements, as the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" was modelled on the work of cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Where is it in this world?"
Rogers: "The keyger counter was the method used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can hear very well the effects of radiation on the atoms in the mineral."
Evans: “Yes, it looks good now!”
"Hans" Keeger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention has established his name.
A new cancer vaccine has been developed to boost the immune system in "vulnerable" cells.
A new cancer vaccine has been developed to detect "invasive" cells and remove damage and boost the immune system.
The vaccine identifies "invasive" cells as part of the treatment and boosts the immune system
This time, it's the process of extracting immune cells from a patient and transferring them to a lab.
They usually found a type of 'protein' in various cancers and re-injected it.
The vaccine has shown promising results for a variety of cancer patients.
After a woman with ovarian cancer had her "invasive" cells detected and infused with a vaccine to boost her immune system, her cancer was not seen for the next 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, transferring the "found" protein commonly found in various cancers, called HER2, to the lab, and re-injecting those cells.
"Our results show that we have received a promising vaccine," said Professor J. Persofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Persofsky explained that HER2 is "the causative agent for the development of many different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
The same method of detecting "vulnerable" cells and targeting those cancer cells with a vaccine to boost the immune system has yielded good results in the type of blood cancer.
After appearing on Kanye West's SNL, Trump wore a big hat and started talking about him.
I'm not feeling well.
After hosting a non-stop show praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying that he would take over in 2020, Kenya hosted West at the studio for Saturday Night Live.
After he wore America's big cap and sang the third song of the night, Coast Town, he raised his voice against democracy and lent his support to Trump.
"When I spoke to white people several times, they said, 'How do you like Trump? He's a colorist.'
"If I had known, I would have left the United States a long time ago."
Matt Damon began the SNL show with the Hollywood star appearing in a comedy depicting Brett Kavanaugh's oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a request against sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it didn't air, West's speech was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I don't know if he's going to try and get the ball rolling on this one.
He also complained to the audience that West had received harsh criticism behind the stage because of his headphones.
"They put me on the back foot.
He said, "Don't leave this place."
They've attacked me!
"According to the Washington selectors, I am in a deeply peaceful place," she said.
As the West walks along, "Do you want to see a place of deep peace?" "Put on my Superman costume", don't ask me what to do next. Do you want to take the world to the next level?
make love to you."
His comments greatly impressed the audience and embarrassed SNL crew members, with the single man reporting that the entire studio was "smoothly silent" with his words.
West replaced Mac Miller, Ariana Grande's ex-boyfriend and rapper who died a few days earlier.
She was dressed as a Westerner and sang the song I Love It, which was very well received by the audience.
West was supported by the conservative group TPUSA, which tweeted: "Very brave soul: Thank you for standing up against the rebels."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was him, so it was great."
"I don't want to encourage anyone who puts forward ideas that are harmful to society (not buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art").
Its free.
We are ready.'
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name to "Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, having previously been known as TT, Puff Daddy, Puffy and PTT.
Following the rap singer, the musician, formerly known as Prince, changed his name to Snoop Lion for Snoop Dogg.
Man charged with attempted murder over Belfast restaurant stabbing case
A 45-year-old man is under investigation for the offence of stabbing a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Palihakamur, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Criminal Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Service will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has broken down the most common characteristics about men
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Swordsman in HBO's medieval fantasy violence series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, who has established himself as an assertive hero with typical traits, says he feels such roles on screen are often unappreciated by young boys.
Speaking at the Sunday Times Kultur, Kidd said that the most common way to ask why something goes wrong is to look at men in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who co-starred with her in the Game of Thrones series, said she felt "very brave" about facing the issue.
"I feel very, very brave personally at this time - what's wrong with being manly," he said.
“What do we teach men based on the problem we see now as they grow up?”
Kitt believes that television is one of the main reasons for the increase in illusory view of men.
'What is natural and what is taught?' he continued to question
Don't they have to be taught on TV and on the streets that they should only do certain things when they're young?
I think that's a really big question at this point in time - how do we change that?
They are being taught the most blatantly wrong doctrines.'
When the series ends next summer, she said that she would not be doing the Game of Thrones finale or sequel, adding that "the relationship with the battlefields and knights is over."
From November, Kidd will be starring in the film Revival of Sam Seifert True, a film by the filmmaker and his brother and rap singer.
The best thing about playing Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
It was at this event that I met my wife, so in that way the series has given me my future family and my life.
Rose played Yigrite, the romantic heroine of the Emmy-winning fantasy series Kid character John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Lesley's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of new cases detected in China
In China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were diagnosed in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new people are caused by unprotected sex in the past.
In earlier times, the disease spread rapidly due to the transfusion of HIV-infected blood to others in specific areas of China.
But Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province that the rate of infection with this type of HIV had been reduced almost completely.
However, annually, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000 people.
In China’s LGBT community, the prevalence of HIV through sex was high.
Homosexuality was completely abolished in China in 1997, but the LGBT movement is on the rise.
Studies say that because of the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the time, these diseases are caused by unhealthy lifestyles.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has stated that it is taking steps to make HIV drugs available to everyone.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee's release of the GOP Senators' data was a "blatant lie" and said it was just a "conspiracy."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday strongly condemned allegations that one of her staff had published the personal information of three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia page Lamekars.
Activists in Los Angeles called for immediate action on "Ultra Right Wing" teachers and the website.
"Lies and lies are the most disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The home address and phone numbers of two U.S. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah and Aaron Hatch of Utah, according to the report.
The information was posted online on Capitol Hill on Thursday during the Senate committee hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct and was on trial in the Supreme Court.
This information was released shortly after the three Senators raised the question to the attention of the Senate.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Editor and Redstate have claimed that the IP address that can identify the source of the post is from Waters's office and that it was published by Waters' staff from the Hill.
This unfounded allegation is completely false, and Waters continued to claim it was a complete lie.
"My staff, who have been falsely accused and have lost their identity, personal information and security, are not responsible in any way for the publication of this information.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and is a complete lie."
Waters' statement quickly gained criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is abhorrent," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that he is not fit to be a Congressman."
When someone accuses someone of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They should not behave like this.
They should not question the accused.
They need to be calm and quiet."
Fleischer was critical of Waters' response to the Democrats' takeover of Kavanaugh, which critics said he was too angry about during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro has also expressed his thoughts on Twitter to oust Waters in the midterm elections.
"This is the biggest crime of truth," he said.
In a statement, Waters said his office "strongly condemned the authorities and law enforcement agencies involved in this fraud."
He said, "Those who commit such acts, even if they are my servants, will be dealt with according to law for their acts and misdeeds."

It's now customary to expect Brexit highlights in any new British-style film, which seems to apply to the Johnny English action-adventure spoof version as well - starting with Johnny English in 2003 and relaunching on Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Would it be fun to tell the central story of how transparent we are for the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the irreplaceable Johnny English with his big-eyed rubber face has had the opportunity to update these for a second time - his gestures are at the forefront of all other non-English-speaking comic films.
He has acted as a ferocious but bizarre secret agent, as well as a little-reflecting Cloza, which was the theme of the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, with the participation of Mr. Bean and Dalapin.
He played a character based on the now-disappeared Barclay Card television commercials passenger and international mystery man who caused confusion in his rise.
There have been one or two excellent moments in the recent JE outing.
I love the fact that he was wearing a white shirt with a white t-shirt on the front of his shirt.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy is on display, but the comedy feels too powerful and strangely overpowering. In particular, "Serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now the main characters of the comedy.
I feel like comedy is more for kids than adults, and for me they aren't as innovative as the comedies that Bean characterises through the sleazy and misogynistic acts of Atkinson's silent-film Johnny English.
The move has caused major problems in the UK.
The cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's powerful-secret network and exposed the identities of all British agents in the sector, as well as the regrettable manner in which Kevin Elton, an off-duty agent, played little role.
She played the prime minister in the last series, losing her political influence in the series, and Emma Thompson did very well in this Quasi Theresa May role, but the story didn't match her.
His intelligence advisors inform him that he should seek the help of someone who is at rest as all the active spies have been compromised.
Johny is currently employed as a school teacher at Bosch and teaches a number of non-textual subjects, including the best techniques on spying.
The English convened an emergency meeting in Whitehall, most importantly expecting Ben Miller to rejoin.
Bowe is currently married, as well as serving as the Navy's chief of staff, and is married to comedian Vicky Pepperdine.
So it's very difficult for Batman and Robin to re-implement their majestic secret service, so Olga Kurylenko's beauty queen, Ophelia Bulletova, is sought out.
At the same time, the prime minister has a conflict with a billionaire from the tech company that solves all of Britain's computer-related problems, such as bad Jason Volta, who plays Jack Lazi.
English and Bov start an odyssey of their high-class jingles, disguised as crews, they set fire to a flash French restaurant, defend themselves in Volta's luxury boats, and begin to feel the emptiness of the English as they try to use the public virtual reality headset at Volta's home.
For the final scene, all the obstacles are removed, but just as with the excitement and excitement, the whole thing is shown on childrens TV.
A beautiful sight.
But I can't imagine it in another Johnny English, couldn't the British film industry recognize Rowan Atkinson and his talent?"
Workers in the UK are set to work four days a week, but are being paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has called for Britain's workers to work four days a week, but to seriously consider a five-day wage package.
The party wants corporate employers to pass on the revenue generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers with an extra day off.
Employees will definitely want a three-day holiday, but will carry the same amount of pay home.
Sources said the idea was "fit" with the party's economic progress and was aimed at strengthening the country in favour of workers.
The four-day work week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to make good use of the economic changes.
"The policy is expected to be reviewed and announced by the end of this year," a senior Labour source told The Sunday Times.
“It doesn’t happen overnight, but the four-day-a-week work is the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, and fits in with the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour cannot claim to have adopted such a position at first, as the Greens committed to a four-day-a-week program during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the plan has not yet been approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
"The four-day work week has not been considered by the party as the policy of the party," a Labour spokesman said.
Shadow administrator John McDonnell used last week's labor conference to express his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
John McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "directors who do not disclose identity" and "profit takers" at app companies.
The current shareholders in the water companies should not take back their entire shares as Labour will have to face a "loss" due to the government's mistake, the Shadow Executive said.
The plan is to incorporate workers on company boards, hand over 10 percent of the shares of private sector companies to employees, and create an employee-owned ownership fund, where they can receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy said on the TV show "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the Bureau's findings raise the question of whether Republican senators can be restrained from running for re-election.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" show reporter Scott Belle asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could lead to their change of mind.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his fellow South Carolinans.
"I think we can do it," Kennedy said.
"I went to the court and told the judge that I had spoken very carefully.
So I called him and he said, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>What are you doing?
He was clear, concise, and patient.
However, it seems difficult to change Graham's wording.
"I'm very happy with my decision and it's going to be a tough one," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Fred vehemently denied it," Graham said.
He couldn't remember everyone's name.
Now 36 years old.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, with a parade of massively exotic stars and an equally impressive global effort to end poverty.
Now in its seventh year for the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people can be seen flocking to the central park's huge lawn not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 said Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Powers Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert goers must complete a series of tasks or "actions," including volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or engaging in other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has it been with Global Citizen still 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an honest way of asking people to get involved in the action, or in another case called "using social media" - would it be right for people to feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online complaint petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters persuading those who make different targets.
These actions have helped inspire world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that are set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and announcements stemming from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been devolved or raised as funding.
The Committee estimates that protected funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key pledges include a joint programme of UK-based investors and enforcers, The Power of Nutrition, which promises to "help children grow to their full potential," and has pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Tracey Ulman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador, told people during a live concert in London in April 2018.
After more than 5,000 steps were taken by asking the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would provide funding for the Power of Nutrition, a program that reaches 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
The FAQ section of its website answers the question, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded thus: The global citizen responded: 'It will be a long and arduous path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements before us, we will prevail, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA9> will perform at the show in New York this year, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to "invade" Russia's energy exports
As quoted by the Washington Examiner, US Secretary of State Ryan Jinghe has revealed that Washington could take over its navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy flow to markets including the Middle East.
Jinghe accused Russia's involvement in Syria, particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"The reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to arrange and deliver the energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability, through its navy, to open up sea lanes and, if necessary, to block their access to the energy market," he said.
Singhi was speaking at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called "The Voice of Energy Consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were effectively identical.
"Referring to Russia as a "single-armed state" with an economy based on fossil fuels, he said, "Iran and Russia's economic preference is almost certainly to develop and replace fossil fuels."
The reports come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with exporting its liquefied natural gas to Europe as a much cheaper option for European consumers, instead of Russia.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into Moscow's "prisoner."
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline's capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Remlin argues that economic reasons are a strong reason for Washington to completely oppose the project, and that it is an example of dishonest competition.
"I believe we shared the view that energy should not be used as a crisis weapon and that suppliers should be chosen by consumers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, concluding a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany has given a befitting response to the US approach and it has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The US has asked Germany's leading industrial conglomerate, the Confederation of German Industry (BDI), to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, said: "Even if a third country interferes with our energy supply, that's a big problem for me."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she "must be careful" in the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she "must be careful" in the upcoming presidential election.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for president.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes prioritizing women," she said.
"After November 6, I will think very carefully about the campaign for the presidential election."
During a Town Hall meeting, he talked about President Donald Trump, which means "he's taking this country the wrong way."
"It's hard for me when I think about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been very open about his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not expect him to run in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research/Boston Globe, "almost fifty-eight percent" of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be running.
Thirty-two percent supported the measure.
Ex-Governor Davel Patrick was the most favored candidate, with 38 per cent in favour and 48 per cent against.
Among the top-profile Democratic names discussed over the 2020 election were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision in January.
Sarah Palin commented on Track Palin's PTSD during the Donald Trump rally
Drak Paulin, 26, had been in Iraq for a year after being placed on the military's list in September.
He was arrested and jailed for assaulting a woman he knew on Monday night.
"I can compare the hardships my own son is going through, the hardships he has been going through since his return, the PTSD commitments and the wounds of our returning soldiers with other families who feel the pain," he told a crowd at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline describes his arrest as "the main problem that people avoid talking about," and while referring to her son and other war veterans "who were seen a little differently on their return, they came back with a narrow mind and wondered if their fellow soldiers and airmen and everyone else in the military had any respect for their dedication to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman, attempting to stop him from making a report of violence while intoxicated and carrying a weapon, police spokesman Dan Bennett said.
18 provinces and D.C. support the challenge to the new archival policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims of group or family violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia had filed a lawsuit against a court-appointed attorney in Washington to support a policy that would challenge the archive's applicant.
The plaintiff's full name was not released in the Grace v. Sessence case filed by the American Civil Liberties in August against federal policy.
He said his wife and "members of his violent group" had bullied him, but U.S. officials had rejected his request for a stay at the inn on July 20.
He was stationed in Texas.
Grace, supported by provincial prosecutors, explains El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, that as nations grapple with common problems of domestic violence, the number of applicants seeking U.S. custody in these provinces is higher.
The new U.S. immigration policy was revised to counter the 2014 decision by the Immigrants Board that unauthorized immigrants could be admitted to an asylum in order to escape family violence.
In a statement Friday, General Carl Resin, Colombia's attorney general, said the new policy "neglects decades of provincial, federal and international law."
"According to federal law, all archival claims can be adjudicated on specific facts and circumstances, but those violations must have a primary cause," the court's counsel said in a statement.
Prosecutors further argued that the US economy would be hit by the policy denial of immigrants, and that they were more likely to come as entrepreneurs and "employees in need of support."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to allow victims of domestic violence and group violence to stay in shelters since June.
"Capitalism is for those who leave their home country because of religious persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Cessance said in a policy announcement on June 11.
The Internet is not the place to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day, even if they are very serious problems.
As the number of dead in Palu has doubled, rescue efforts to trace the living have been intensified.
The environment is getting worse for the people who live there.
"I feel very pained," said Riza Kusuma, 35, as she consoled her son who was shivering with fever at a rescue camp in Balu.
"Every minute, bodies come in an ambulance.
It's hard to get clean drinking water."
Residents are returning to their damaged homes, picking up submerged objects, and trying to take whatever material is available to them.
Due to the damage caused by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, hundreds of people have been injured, causing hospitals to overflow.
Some of the injured, including Divi Harris, who suffers from a broken spine and shoulder, were resting outside Balu's military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to strong minor earthquakes.
He said he felt a strong earthquake shaking the 5th floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I think I'm trapped inside the collapsed structures," Harris told The Associated Press, adding that she was staying at Balu with her family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was only silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'threat' over 'propaganda ads'
An official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. Daily promoting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, a week after the announcement, accusing Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
After accusing China of meddling in the US elections on November 6, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's money-laundering advertisements in the Des Moines Register, the province's top-selling newspaper, which China has denied.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to meddle in the US elections, and US officials said Reuters was a new way to campaign among the people in Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for a foreign government to issue advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging a trade war in which one country imposes tough tariffs on another country's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said the tariffs, which China announced earlier in the trade war, were designed to target exporters in provinces such as Loa, which support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad - US ambassador to China and a longtime governor of Loa, one of China's leading exporters of agricultural goods, said Beijing had caused harm to American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, in which he said that China "is increasing its trade-related threat by publishing propaganda ads in our own media."
"The Chinese government is taking advantage of the tradition of protected speech and media freedom in the United States by issuing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda," Branstad said.
"On the contrary, you'll see particular contrasting voices in the newsstand on Beijing street and you won't see a true reflection of the different views the Chinese people may have about China's complex economic migration, such as the way the media operates under the thumb of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
"One of China's most important newspapers rejected the offer to publish," he wrote, but did not specify which newspaper it was.
Republicans lose women's votes in by-elections over Kavanaugh's fall issue, analysts warn
Several prominent Republicans are backing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and trying to protect him so that they will suffer a backlash, especially if they lose women's vote in the upcoming by-elections, analysts have warned.
The emotional turbulence over the incident is at its peak, and the official statement from many Republicans shows that they are willing to go along with their plan for the vote.
Such things cannot be changed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University.
Reeher said she suspects Senator Jeff Blake (R-Arizona) is in a last-minute rush to the FBI investigation in order to appease angry voters.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, "Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget this tomorrow, nor the month of November," said Karen Jean Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive Movement on Friday.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Kristen Blasey Ford, the protesters shouted "November is coming!" at the Hallway of the Senate on Friday morning, as the Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee to choose the release of Kavanaugh, who had been charged, according to Mike.
"Democratic interest and motivation is going to be very high," Stu R<0xC3><0xB6>denberg, a political analyst with the non-political group, told the news site.
"People say it's already too much; it's true.
But this pattern may be much higher, especially among female voters and young female voters, aged 18 to 29 who live in suburbs where they don't like the president and don't vote often."
Even before Ford detailed his allegations of sexual harassment in public against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts have suggested that Republicans could face backlash if they proceed with affirmative action.
According to NBC News, "This is a disturbing situation for the GOP," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be punished, it's also about how the Republicans are handling this and how they treat him," Kaiy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, which helps select Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
However, Americans who were persuaded by Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony may change their minds at the time of the election.
In a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41 percent of respondents said they certainly or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, and 30 percent said Ford had probably or certainly lied during his testimony.
In the wake of the crisis, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations against Ford and another accused, Dibora Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee last week that he had been subjected to harassment by Kavanaugh when he was 17.
Ramirez has alleged that Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, went to a party together in the 1980s when he was studying in Yale, where he showed her his genitals.
In order to compete with Google and Facebook, the inventor of World Wide Web is planning to launch a new web
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Tech Legend's latest project is an infrastructural company that builds Solitaire, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and to whom to allow access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast, Berners-Lee joked that "world domination" was the motive behind the insurgents.
"We have to start now," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
The app, which uses Solitaire's technology, allows people to create their own personal online data storage, or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's available in the same browser and all at the same time, like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify.
The unique thing about personal online data storage is that the user decides who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this "Personal Development through Data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of T-Mobile, the idea of Infrapt is to bring the company the resources, process, and relevant skills that make Solitaire accessible to everyone.
The company is currently working on the project with Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's acquired security platform, some contract-based developers, and the code-writing community.
Earlier this week, tech developers around the world were able to build their own Internet-based applications using tools available on the InRobot website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a technology that would completely change business models overnight."
"We didn't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Infrapt's mission is to "provide a professional energy and ecosystem to help preserve the integrity and quality of the new Internet creation in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in web neutral debate.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I have no doubt about the next web era," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric Celebration
During World War I, the victory of the only Church of England cleric to win Victoria Cross from a warrior was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Commander-in-Chief Colonel The Reverend Bernard von won the Medal of Honor on 29 September 1918 for his role in the attack on Bellenkillis and Leihoucourt.
However, four days after winning the award, he was killed by a mysterious sniper, so he was unknown to anyone who saw him receive the prestigious award of the British Army.
The commemorative medal was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Mitchell Wan, said it was a "wonderful code" medal and emerged exactly 100 years after the year of his grandfather's award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel von led his regiment in Colonel de Saint-Quintin "amidst thick snow and a heavy shelling from field guns."
He then changed the route of the line of fire in a desperate hurry, before doing so leading his brigade with a "wonderful valour" of fighting with a rifle in one hand, and attacking three battle groups.
General Colonel Vane was shot in the chest by a German man on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "some of the most positive things I know, some of the most positive things I've ever observed in my life, but some of the most modest."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wan, paid their respects with a flower ring after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "very proud to take part in the parade" and that the brave warriors were going to be exposed with the support of many more people.
MMA fans have been waiting all night to see Belador 206
Imagine an environment where you've been awake all night and watching the main show, and you're not the only one broadcasting the Bakelite Belter 206 main fight.
San Jose's Bill has 13 fights, including six fights on the main card, shown live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., both Keycard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for a brawl with each other, and suddenly the coverage shifted to Peppa Pig, shocking audiences in the UK.
Some of the people who attended the meeting were very disappointed.
A fan had tweeted about the screening of a children's cartoon on Twitter as "infuriating humour."
When asked about the change in the show, Belater's senior vice-president for marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said, "It's government regulation that a show broadcast at 6 a.m. should be suitable for children to watch, otherwise it shouldn't be broadcast, so they switched to children's programming."
"Pop music, yeah.
The company's CEO, Scott Koker, said the company will be working on a schedule for future UK viewers to see.
"When I think about re-broadcasting, I think I can do it right," Coker said.
"But we can't do that until Sunday morning at six o'clock in the morning, our time is Sunday, and then it becomes Monday for them."
But we are still trying.
Trust me, there were a lot of text messages that came in when the show changed, and they weren't for the better.
We tried to fix it and thought it was a technical error.
This is not a technical problem, it is a government problem.
I promise that won't happen next time.
We put five fights instead of six - that's what we usually do - and we tried to give more to the fans, which is why we increased the number of fights.
This is an unexpected event."
Tom Daley says he feels 'humiliated' about sex
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley has said that he grew up feeling low because of his sexuality, and that's what inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he learned after going to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Dissident Island Discs hosted by Laurene Laverne, the player spoke about the rights of male gays to "give hope" to others.
His parents said they were concerned about the possibility of a return to the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to ill health.
Participating in Loverney's first show as a swimmer, Dal<0xC3><0xAD> said that when he was growing up, he considered himself "less than everyone else" because "men like men and women like women" were socially unacceptable.
He added: 'Today, the feelings of undervaluing myself, the feelings of being different will be the real things that give me the energy and the energy to succeed.'
He said he wanted to prove that he had "some talent," so he didn't hurt himself when others found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze-medallist is an active campaigner for LGBT rights, using her attendance at this year's Commonwealth Games to demand that more countries report that homosexuality is not legally wrong.
He said that I am expressing my views in public because I feel lucky that I am able to live openly without fear and want to "give hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with American film director Dustin Black, whom he met in 2013 - and that he had "falled in love with sight."
Last year, Dal<0xC3><0xAD> married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him.
"When you've experienced so many weights and grinds as a child - when you first competed at the Olympic Games at the age of 14, when your father died of cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone like my age who's gone through such highs and lows," she said.
The couple became parents in June, naming their baby boy Robert Ray Black-Taley, after which Dal<0xC3><0xAD> said that his "whole outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said my only aim is to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
It's my Olympic gold medal."
He was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> said he didn't believe his father was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had gotten tickets because he wanted to sit in the front row and watch the London 2012 Olympics.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't going to be the dad to sit in the front row," she said.
"I was holding his hand when he was about to stop for his last breath, and not only until he actually took his last breath, but I was holding his hand even after he died, and eventually realizing that we can't win death, I accepted his death," she said.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> competed in the 2012 Olympics, the year after his father's death, and won a bronze medal.
"I have a dream in my entire career - that is to hit the dive in front of a local fanbase at the Olympic Games and there is no greater joy than that," he said.
That's why Heather Smallin was so proud to be the first to inspire her - she said that this song inspired her to compete at the Olympics and that she's still doing it.

Mickelson did not play in Saturday's Ryder Cup.
When he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, US player Bill Mickelson will set a new record, but he will have to return to his form if he wants to make the feat a happy one.
Mickelson, who has been playing for the past two years, is set to make his 12th consecutive appearance, as captain Jim Furyk was not picked for Saturday's four-balls and fours.
Known as a player for the United States and a five-time primary winner, he was, instead of being the main competitor, the team's promoter for his day and was working to fix his problem and make the tournament better.
The 48-year-old, who has never hit a straight drive shot despite his peak, is not particularly good for the Tait Lee Golf National Course, where long-distance shots are a missed shot.
And if the ground stands alone, it won't be that complicated, with Mickelson in Sunday's ninth match against British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who is set to win all four matches this week, teaming up with rookie Tommy Flitwick.
The U.S. team, which is set to start 12 singles matches, is four points behind, and must have a good start in singles matches, so Mickelson's competition is very important.
Furyk has said he has confidence in him, although he has not spoken further on the matter.
"He understands the responsibility that has been given to him today, accepts it fully, lays his hands on me and I am ready for tomorrow's match," he said.
"He has a lot of confidence in him.
He's a great player and has contributed a lot to the team this season.
I don't think he's going to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it turned out to be exactly what we expected.
He wanted to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson is set to break Nick Faldo's record of playing the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This may have been his final match for the Ryder Cup, which was not entirely in line with his personal record highs.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, but his presence gives the team a bit more strength.
"He's funny, funny, fun to talk to and laugh with others, which would be great if he was in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players are having a lot of fun going with him and there was a lot of fun going to see him this week as well.
He taught me a lot about the game."
European captain Thomas Peon has said that the big lead is likely to disappear soon.
European captain Thomas Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9> has said that from his experience, he knows that the big lead from yesterday's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut during a match at Vulderrama in 1997, when Save Pelestroz was captain, five points ahead of the Americans, although the match was close to victory with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x80><0x93>131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
In the matches on Friday and yesterday, after watching the Class of 2018 win 10-6, 5-3 at the Lee Golf National, he said, "We had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brooklyn, here we lost and we won at Valderrama, continue to remind ourselves that this is the truth."
So history will remember me and everyone on the team, it's not over yet.
We need to make the most of tomorrow.
Do your best and do the right thing.
This will not be possible until the necessary conditions are met.
We have a goal, our goal is to win this cup, our only focus is on that.
From the beginning, I have been saying that we are focusing on the 12 players on our side while we are also aware of the top players on the other side."
I'm glad to see his players playing at a tough golf course," Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9> said, adding: "I'm not going to stop doing what I can.
Tomorrow's match will be different.
Everyone's talents should be brought to light during tomorrow's match, and that's a different thing we have to do.
It's a wonderful feeling to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play alone, you test your full potential as a golfer.
You need to make it clear to the players that you will show your full potential tomorrow.
Let him play and let him play and let him play to his full potential."
In contrast to Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better when they play separately than when they play as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was on both ends of yesterday's unexpected big changes as Europe won because he performed a "miracle on Medina" and thus was on the winning team at Brookline before Furyk ended up as the loser.
When Ben Crenshaw, who led his team to victory on the final day, was asked in 1999 how he performed, he replied: "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches and as you see in the Brooklyn, I want to give you a fantastic start at Medina.
When the momentum is driven in the same direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We're going to have to put our best foot forward, and we're going to have to play some good football tomorrow."
Thomas handles the task of trying to win, and he meets Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Rahm, Tommy Flitwood and Rolly McIlroy in the top-half, and another top-half includes Ian Boulter and other Europeans.
"I've played with people in this order, and I think it's going to lead to success all the way through," Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9> said of her singles selections.
Germany's new warship has been delayed again.
The German navy should have replaced the old Cold War war ships with new munitions by 2014, but due to misalignments and price increases, it will not be possible until next year, according to local media.
A military spokesman said the delivery of the "Rheinland-Falge," the flagship ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigate, had been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the De Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but due to post-delivery issues, the project was delayed.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class warships.
They include a dynamic artillery, an organized array of anti-air and anti-ship missiles, and stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and sound path modeling.
Another important aspect includes long-term maintenance - the possibility that the new warships will be kept out of local ports for up to two years, but will likely not be.
However, a series of delays meant that the advanced warships would expire at a time when they had already entered overseas service, a lesson for Germany to assess overseas capabilities.
The F125 made headlines last year when a German naval officer refused to use the warship and returned it to the Lom and Wass shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the company that built it.
The reasons for the return were little known, although German media reported that the warship had a number of important "hardware and software flaws" that would render it useless if used in military operations.
Software flaws were very important, as Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors. The number of these sailors was only half of the crew on the older Bremen-type warships.
It was also revealed that the ship was too heavy to reduce its performance, and that the ship might not be able to add improvements to the ship in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Falge" is believed to be twice as heavy as the German warships used in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the ship crew, also becomes an issue.
This is said to have risen from the initially reported <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problems with the new warships have become increasingly important, in view of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Block Council, admitted that the number of "seaworthy ships" was limited.
The problem is increasing day by day as the old ships are becoming unusable and no new ships are being provided, the official said.
He regretted that no Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships were fit to join the fleet.
National Trust to monitor bats' secret lives
New research is underway at an estate in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the findings of the research will provide new information about the function of unique flying mammals and will help in carrying out future conservation measures.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland are researching the common and soprano fibrostrels and brown-eared long-eared bats and the Taupenton bats that live in the Indrevie Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at sensitive locations across the forest where they live, to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers use hand-held detectors to conduct surveys on mobile phones.
The expert sound analysis of all the records will find out the frequency of the bat's sounds and what the creature does.
A habitat map and report will be prepared to create an image detailing their activity in the landscape.
Rob Dewar, an adviser to the NTS, hopes the results will reveal what areas are important to bats in the habitat and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine how best to maintain the forest for bats and other related species, such as the habitat management benefits of grassland formation.
The number of bats across Scotland and the UK, however, has declined significantly over the past hundred years.
They are threatened by the building and development work that affects the habitat of birds and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting pose a threat, and insect - repellent paper and some chemicals present in building materials, as well as attacks by cats that are raised as pets, pose a threat.
The waves are not really visible.
However, because they search for food at night, they use their ears more than their eyes when they catch prey.
They use intelligent echo location technology to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important plantations and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, places great emphasis on bats.
It consists of ten trained experts who will conduct surveys, survey in grassland areas and sometimes even undertake rescue operations.
The company has set up the first-of-its-kind protection designated for bats in Scotland at the Treve Estate in Dumbris and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says that the estate is the best place for bats.
"We've got a lot of good players here at Derby," he said.
"We have old buildings, more old trees and a better habitat.
But there are still many things we don't know about bats, and the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what bats need."
He stresses that it is very important to check on bats before undertaking maintenance work inside buildings, as the destruction of a single grassland floor can leave 400 female bats and young bats to die, which can destroy almost the entire species.
Bats are protected and it is a criminal offence to kill, harass, disturb or destroy them.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish officer for the Vauval Defence Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about bats and a lot of our natural life forms, but we don't know exactly how they're declining."
Ronaldo's lawyers are suing the German newspaper for libel.
Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers have sued German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations, calling the rape claims against him "false news" and using his name to say that "other people want to make themselves famous."
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape claims against him "false news," using his name to say he "wants to be popular."
Portugal and the Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayorca, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel said he agreed to pay her $375,000 to keep her out of trouble over the incident.
Hours after the news of the clips surfaced, the 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video, at which time he described the news as "false news."
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
Today's news is fake news," five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo said in front of the camera.
"They want to use my name.
This is usual.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's their job.
"I'm happy and everything is going well," he said.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, calling it "unacceptable to publish suspicious information about personal matters."
It could be one of the most serious breaches in recent years with respect to individual rights violated, with a player claiming damages for "dignified reputational losses associated with a serious violation," lawyer Christian Sarst said.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at Clark County Distirctive Court in Nevada, it was reported that after meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca both went to Ronaldo's room and raped him there.
Ronaldo fell to his knees and apologized, saying that he was "99 percent a good man" and that he had made a "one percent mistake" unknowingly.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has claimed that he had sex with both of them, but this was done with the consent of both parties.
Mayorka has said she went to the police and photographed her injuries at the hospital, adding that she later admitted to the settlement held outside the court because she was "afraid of the backlash" and worried about being "ugly in public."
34-year-old Mayorca says he is looking for a way to avoid settlement because he is constantly being mentally hurt because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo joined Manchester United's Real Madrid at the time of the rape charges, joining the Italian Giants' Juve this summer on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
UK, EU exit process: UK 'always going to be sad' about losing car manufacturers
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the UK "will always be regretful" if it loses its position as a world leader in car production after its exit from the European Union.
Toyota UK has told the BBC it is "painful" that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will have to temporarily halt production at its plant in Parnanaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has said that delays on border issues in the event of Britain's exit from the EU without a deal could result in unemployment.
The factory, which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvi Cooke, executive director of the company.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without knowing how a deal on the cross-border business would work.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Oxford-run small-scale factory one month after Britain leaves the European Union.
One of the most important issues for car manufacturers is that there will be problems with the supply chain if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
Toyota's production system operates on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts for cars that are ordered to be manufactured arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, it could cause disruptions at the border, with industry stepping in and causing delays in the supply of parts.
Toyota has announced that it will only be able to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Terpisher factory.
Mr Clarke and Theresa May's testimonial programme for future relations with the EU means that "such tests at the border will be measured with precision to avoid any further cross-border ramifications."
"We need to make a deal. We need a better deal, which means it's not just a win we're going to enjoy right now, it's a chance to make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"What Toyota and other car manufacturers need is for them to be able to continue their successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long the production would be suspended, but it warned that long-term additional costs could reduce the factory's competitiveness and result in the loss of jobs.
Peter DeSouvallaris, who has been working in Barnanasta for 24 years and is a unit union convener at the industrial plant, says that the fear of his team members is increasing: "In my experience, once these jobs leave us, they will not come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have recommended an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
As the case of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's most sensitive meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosinstein "may be postponed by another week."
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election interference, possible links between Trump aides and Russia, and the possibility of interference in the presidential judiciary.
Although Trump did not fire or dismiss the deputy attorney general, the speech hovered in Washington for months as a result of the obstruction of Mueller's freedom.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosinstein had discussed the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment, as well as the wearing of a wire to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
He went to the White House on Monday to announce his resignation.
Instead, it was announced to hold a meeting on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't" remove Rosenstein, but later, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, delayed the meeting to avoid conflict with the investigation.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh and delayed a full Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about his meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, and it may be this week, but considering all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court, it looks like it could be pushed back a week."
“I want to see what they have to say, and I want to hear what they have to say,” he said.
Some journalists will only question that statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why that was.
Sanders responded by saying that the only reason he rarely held a press conference was not because of the way television journalists behave to "appreciate others," but, "I don't deny that they do it just to be complimented."
He also said that he would like to see more direct communication between Trump and the media.
"The president attends more Q&A sessions than any president before him," he said, without citing sources.
Sanders said he would hold more brief press conferences and told reporters, "If I had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it would be better than talking to me forever."
We've been trying to do that a lot, and you've seen a lot of it over the last few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, it's going to take the place of a press conference."
Trump usually responds to reporters when he leaves the White House or when he is at open meetings or when he is with foreign dignitaries.
It is rare to have a press conference.
In New York this week, perhaps, the president has made an unusual, bizarre appearance before a crowd of reporters and has shown why.
Health Secretary writes letter to EU workers in NHS Scotland on fears of Brexit conference
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working for the NHS in Scotland to express their country's gratitude and wish to remain with them after the Brexit conference.
Jean Freeman, the MSP, wrote a letter less than six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to cover the cost of asylum applications for EU citizens working in the public sector, which it has improved.
In her letter, Freeman said: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal have continued and are moving towards the expected results this autumn.
However, the British government is also preparing for the impending crisis.
I know this will be a difficult time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, irrespective of their nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU have strengthened the work of health care and brought valuable experience and skills to improve it and to benefit the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is absolutely your home, and we definitely want you to stay with us."
Krishan Abercrombie has been admitted to the intensive care unit after suffering a head injury
Former Tennessee State Tigers football team captain Krishan Abercrombie was treated in the emergency department for a head injury in Sundays 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Argon of the Tennessee team.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that his injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He was on the other side of the fence and he was going to get hurt," Reed said.
Before he was taken to the hospital, the coaches and medical staff administered him oxygen and carried him to the hospital for further examination.
An official from the Tennessee State Department told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that there was no need for surgery on Abercrombie at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was no "detail of the type/size of injury" and that the Tennessee State team was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red-shirted second-year student, was playing with the Tennessee State team in his first season after moving from Illinois.
He played a total of five interceptions on Saturday to make his exit from the game, adding up to 18 interceptions this season.
There will be a higher registration fee for foreigners buying property in the UK.
Under the new Tory plans, foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher securities registration fees to help the homeless with the extra money available
The move would make Corbyn's effort to attract young voters nothing.
The increase in registration fees will apply only to non-residents in the UK.
The Treasury expects the scheme to increase by <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Today, Theresa May said that foreigners buying property in the UK will have to pay a higher registration fee - the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters is aimed at high-earnings people.
The increase in registration fees will be imposed on individuals and companies in the UK who do not pay taxes, and the extra money could boost the government's fight against sleep deprivation.
Additional Tax - This is over and above the current registration fee, including additional taxes levied on second home buyers two years ago and home buyers on rentals, which could be more than three per cent.
The move is expected to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-residents in the UK, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to raise prices.
Many of the country's most convenient areas - especially in the capital city - have often become "ghost cities," because most of the buyers are foreigners and spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in bond registration fees to help most young adults buy their first home.
She accused the big corporations of holding land and raising real estate prices by not using it, urging Mrs May to abolish affordable housing quotas to fix Britain's "housing crisis."
Mr Corbyn has pushed for a succession of housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions "without fail."
He also wants to give more authority to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "I said that I would dedicate my leadership to the re-fulfillment of the British dream - to make life better for everyone in the new generation.
It means reforming our fragmented housing market.
"Britain is open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be correct to say that it would be as easy for those who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign-based companies, as for those who live in the UK who work hard.
For most people, the dream of owning a house has become a reality, and sleeping on the streets without a home has become a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to run Scotland'
Sunderland's president, Jack Ross, has said his "top goal" is to become Scotland's manager on a single platform.
The Scott, 42, has gracefully accepted the challenge to bring the North-East club to life, and he is, for now, third in League One, three points from the top.
Last season, after guiding St Mirren back to Scottish leadership, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I love playing for my country.
I got a B cap, that’s all,” Ross said at BBC Scotland’s SportSound.
"But I grew up with my dad watching a lot of Scotland games in Hampden, which is what brought me here anyway.
I can only do that if I have the opportunity to be successful."
Rose's predecessors as manager of Sunderland included Dick Atvocatt, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Boyd, and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss had previously rejected the move from Barnsley and Ipswich, saying he had no qualms about adopting such established names in the big club.
"The measure of success for me at the moment is 'Can I return to the Premier League?'
Due to the infrastructure and facilities at this club, it will undoubtedly be a part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but if I can get back to that club, that's what I'll see as a winner."
Rose, who has been a vice president at Dumbarton for 15 months and has served as Hart's trainee for only three years in his managerial role.
He then helped Alloa move up to the third tier, helping to transform Saint Mirren from a very low position to win the championship title the following season.
Rose also said that she feels more comfortable now than when she was playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton.
Speaking of taking responsibility for Alloa, he recalls, "Maybe it was real cross roads."
"I thought I was better at managing than playing.
This may seem strange, because I have played to a certain degree, lived a good life, and achieved a high standard of living.
But it can be hard to play.
You have a lot of work to do on a weekly basis.
I'm still in the same situation as I was when I started, but it seems to work.
I always wanted to do management, and now I do the same, which is the most comfortable, and I am able to do my job with ease for the rest of my adult life."

The perfect time to drink a pint of wine is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, so the polls are in.
The heatwaves of the summer have made Britains stagnant liquor shops glitter, but they have created a crisis for restaurants.
Sales in bars and restaurants rose 2.7 percent in July - but in restaurants, sales fell 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Compiling the data, CGA business consultant Peter Martin said: "Continuous heat and longer-than-expected UK participation in the World Cup generated a 2.8 percent increase in liquor sales, similar to the previous June, but in restaurants sales were even worse.
Retail sales fell 1.8% in June, and were even worse in July.
The food, drinks, and drinks were all excellent, and the service was outstanding.
Food and beverage outlets were also affected by the heat, but not as much as those who run restaurants.
It seems that people are starting to drink alcohol.
"Everywhere in the managed breweries and breweries, sales increased by 6.6 per cent this month, with food sales down by three per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and hospitality department analyst, said: "These results show the same trend that we've seen since late April.
When it comes to an out-of-home food market, the biggest factors are climate and the impact of large-scale social or sporting events.
While it is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to stagnate, a year-on-year decline of 4.8 percent is particularly painful in the ongoing cost crisis.
The long hot summer should not have come at a bad time for food-drivers and restaurant operators, and it is time to tell if the very mild temperatures we had in August will give them the much-needed relief."
Total sales growth in bars and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in new brand releases.
The Cafer Beach Tracker, an industry sales monitoring system for UK bars, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups with combined sales of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts without their parents' knowledge.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has social media accounts without the knowledge of their parents and Asians.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "fake Insta" pages increased.
These reports have increased the fear of being accused of sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "major" account to show to their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - secretly created social media accounts without the knowledge of adults
A poll of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing website.
This has led to an increased fear of sexual harassment.
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a clean "main" account to show to their parents, while keeping private accounts.
A mother accidentally went to her 13-year-old daughter's secret website and saw a teenage girl begging to "rape" her.
A study conducted by The Headmasters and Headmistress of Independent Schools UK (HMC) found that 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC President Mike Bachanan said: "A lot of teens are being tested for creating websites that parents and teachers can't find."
Eileen Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Aileen Doyle was appointed non-executive director of the Board of Scottish Athletics at the board's annual general meeting.
"Toilet is one of Scotland's most popular athletes, and it's a fantastic opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his varied experience at the international level over the past decade," said Scottish leader Ian Beatty.
"Ailey has a huge respect for athletes in Scotland, England and around the world, and bringing her to the board is definitely something that athletes in Scotland will benefit from," said Petey.
Doyle said: "I'm really looking forward to being a voice for the athletes and I hope I can definitely contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter sprints at the 1996 Atlanta Games with his four Olympic gold medals, is now a regular BBC pundit who is unable to walk after suffering a temporary hemorrhage.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldnt walk.
Only time will tell how long I'll be back."
It was a terrible training, but he has completely recovered, has learned how to walk again, and today he is doing a quick turnaround!
And thanks for the great giveaways!”
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers to cows has sparked a debate online
A breast - feeding company has created a controversy online by posting an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cow's milk.
Introducing the "world's first noiseless wearable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvey released an ad featuring a "dung-in-cheek" video to demonstrate the new pump's independence to breastfeeding mothers.
In it, four mothers, in a haystack, dance to the music with the following lyrics: "Aang, I'm milking, there's no tail", "Don't you see the tail, it's not folding, it's my breasts"
The refrain continues: "Feed, weed, weed, weed, weed, weed, weed, weed, I milk my women."
The announcement, which was posted on Facebook, sparked widespread outrage online.
The video received hundreds of comments, with 77,000 people seeing mixed reactions from those who watched it, calling it a mockery of the dairy industry's "burdens."
"It was a bad decision to use the cow for advertising this product.
"They're going to have to have a baby just like us, they're going to have to get pregnant and give birth, the only difference is that they're going to get pregnant within a few days of their calves being born," one writes.
The Elve's Breast Pump fits neatly into the breast-feeding bra (Elve's/Mother's)
He said: "It's a pain for both the mother and the child.
Why should they not be allowed to have children, and why should they not be allowed to have children?”
Another said: "It's a no-brainer.
Others took to social media to share the news, with one woman saying she was "smiling."
"This is a clever idea.
If I had bought one for my mom, I would have bought one for myself.
The milk made me feel like a cow.
This post is a bit vague, but I'll take what I can get.
It's a clever production."
Another said: "It's a funny ad targeting mothers who breastfeed (often in the workplace or in the toilet) that looks like "cows."
"This is not an endorsement or endorsement of the industry."
At the end of the video, all the women are seen dancing with an unexplored pump inside their bra.
The theme behind the campaign is that many women who breastfeed with a breast pump say they feel the same way as cows.
However, the Elvee pump is completely noiseless and does not have wires or tubes attached to it, and it fits neatly inside the milking bra, allowing women to move around freely, have children, and even go out during lactation.
Ana Palarin, partner at Mother Institute, ECD, said: "This Elve Pump is a very revolutionary product that deserves a bold and angry introduction.
By bringing out the similarity between lactating women and lactating cows, we wanted to bring to light breastfeeding and all of the challenges that it presents, while at the same time making it a form of entertainment and at the same time implementing this new pump's incredible sense of freedom in a way that is comparable.
This is not the first time that Elve Pump has made headlines.
While using the product at London Fashion Week, a mother appeared on the gatewalk for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children gathered peacefully in a tent camp on the Texas border.
While the number of people crossing the border each month remains relatively unchanged, there has been a sharp increase in the number of migrant children taken into custody, which, to some extent, has made it difficult for the Trump administration's hardline rhetoric and policies to keep children with their supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that by offering to adopt a child, their eligibility to remain in the country will be undermined.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that supporters and those in their homes would be required to record their fingerprints and share that data with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced in parliament that several people had been arrested for soliciting support for young people who were left behind.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who support or are a supporter's family are illegal in this country, and the vast majority of them are involved in criminal behavior."
We're still looking for them."
While seeking detailed action on the children, the authorities introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within one month of their arrest, instead of the earlier 60 days for the slum dwellers.
In most cases, a person will appear before an immigration judge via video conference rather than coming directly to the immigration court seeking legal status.
Those who do not comply will be deported immediately.
According to tent workers and reports from the computer system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and stressed, leading to hysterical activities or attempts to escape.
Such concerns are more prevalent in large centres such as Tornillo, where large size makes it more likely to miss the signs of a stuttering child.
Taking children to the tent city without even giving them enough time to mentally prepare and answer to their friends can be a weedy weed.
The United States, France and Turkey have called for the immediate withdrawal of the "occupying forces" from Syria.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moullam called for Syrian refugees to return to the country, even if the country is in the eighth year of the war.
As deputy prime minister, he said foreign forces, under the guise of fighting terrorism, were "illegal on Syrian soil" and "will find a just solution."
"They should be released immediately and unconditionally.
He said the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, in which 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He added that the "holy war" would continue until terrorist groups and any "illegal alien presence" would wipe out all "Syrian terrorists."
The US has 2,000 troops in Syria, which are primarily involved in training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 troops.
In the case of refugees, Mr. Moullam said the situation was such that they were ready to return home, and he accused some "superstitious countries" of "spreading fear without cause" to prevent the refugees from returning.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian agencies to organise the return of the refugees," he said.
"It's a human rights issue that needs to be addressed."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Chirac unless Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
UN officials say Russia and Turkey's recent agreement to set up a demilitarized zone in Idlib, the last city held by the Idlib rebels, has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region of three million people.
However, insisting that there were "clear timelines" for the deal, they hoped the military operations would target holy fighters, including fighters from the al-Queda-linked Nusra Front, and "destroy them."
United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura said he hoped to hold the first meeting of a new group of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria that would pave the way for elections.
Moullam also issued a warning against interference, imposing conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the task of the committee should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution."
Trump will win a second time.
According to that argument, Mr. Trump himself will win the 2020 re-election, unless the impeachment and corruption ends ahead of schedule, as some Freedom Party observers probably think.
Without a doubt, in being "the most inverted final ever before the presidency!"
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the prime-time ratings on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, 1.7 million more than four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" with 3.5 million viewers has taken the lead in cable ratings on a massive news night.
After one of the attacks, a cabinet secretary said of becoming president, "It's a fire that attracts people, because it's not something we understand," said Neil Bayer, who runs the ABC drama Desecrated Survivor.
There is another theory for Ned Scowell, a former comedy writer and editor of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snacking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club
He was in a car accident before the 2016 election.
The driver told Mr. Trump he was going to vote for them.
Why? he asked.
"He said, ""Because he makes me laugh,"" Mrs. Scoville told me."
There is so much value in entertainment.
According to him, more than anything else on TV, the story from Washington, Roe v. Wade, can determine their future, whether the immigrant families can reunite, and the health of the global economy.
This is a very rare event and only the most experienced people can attend it.
However, if you look at what Bob Woodward said in his book "Pear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 Ostrich Leather Bomber Jacket ("This goes for the thickest dress with hubris" - as the Washington Post said), Mr. Trump knows about Stormy Daniels and you'll find a panel of experts discussing tips that will make you drool over their physique.
For some reason, I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario in the same way again.
Speaking about the drama's revolving cast and the daily story twists (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un), he said, "Part of what he does is look like it's happening in real life, because he's giving you something every night."
You can't leave without watching a series, or you'll be left behind.
When I went to see Mr. Flays, the sun was setting 80 degrees outside his house on the north bank of Kauai, but while he was filming CNN, he was inside watching MSNBC.
He couldn't take his eyes off it, not seeing Brett Kavanaugh face the Senate Judiciary Committee, or seeing the future of the Supreme Court swing by.
"I remember when we were taking such frantic scenes and people said, 'This is the end of Western civilization,'" said Mr. Flies to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true."

Money is flowing in from outside the most critical by-election competition.
It's no surprise that the runoff for Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district has resulted in two incumbents running for the same office.
This recently redefined suburban Pittsburgh district, the Democratic representative. Connor Lamb stops them <0xE2><0x80><0x93> he won a seat in another district last spring in a special election.
Lampe is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th District, most of which is in the new 17th District.
The maps were redacted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had drafted unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th district has kicked off a tight campaign finance race between the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), the major political party's sources of funding.
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a narrow vote in a widely-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The district was held by a Republican for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the district by a 20-point margin.
The Democrats have taken a hard line against the Democrats.
U.S. to impose fines on El Salvador for backing China
The envoys noted that with some support from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing.
He had an accommodation in Panama until 2017 when Mr. Trump held a conciliatory meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and the shareholders expelled the Trump establishment’s management team.
In a statement earlier this month, Department of State spokesman Heather Nauert said that because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," U.S. diplomats in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama decided to withdraw their heads of diplomatic missions from the country.
But the fines were intended only against El Salvador, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including in drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, which would have a severe impact on the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As in-house meetings have improved, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic development, following a similar meeting last year that was seen as an attempt to halt immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, ending any plans to fine El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the meeting, a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting, which is scheduled for mid-October for now, a embassy official said.
In addition, the three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic from Washington without any harsh messages or punishments.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three US officials, including the two who agreed to discuss the internal discussions on the condition that the names not be disclosed.
Their accounts were examined and confirmed by an external analyst, who was very close to the administration and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The history of research
The next emerging cat may be a statement by Robert Mueller, a special counsel who brushed aside the issue of Mr. Trump's possible concealment of justice, which, as of now, the most compelling piece of evidence on the government record.
It appears that Mueller has directed his investigation into the Russian attacks on our elections into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was engaged in covert co-operation.
If the Congress party changes, as he prepares to go to the voters, and ultimately to one of his likeliest judges, Mr. Trump himself will have to take responsibility for the organization.
There's a lot of Q-tips in it, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall - or that the fall of his peers in Europe - is inevitable.
We all have to make choices that will affect how long this struggle lasts on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, the German authorities were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler only if the Westerners opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed then, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the tens of thousands of deaths that followed.
It is in such radiant places that the course of history changes, in which the pace of democracy picks up or slows down.
The United States is currently facing a number of similar challenges.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenthal, who is in control of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Ever since the statement was made, Rosenstein has been pouring water on their feet, advising the president to investigate and register secretly, predicting that he will be disqualified from office.
Mr. Rosenden says that the Times' account is inaccurate.
"What would we say if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's new plea was not full or fair - or if despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony, he was confirmed to the Supreme Court?
And, most importantly, will we vote for Congress in the by-elections to keep Mr. Trump under house arrest?
If we don't win this war, democracy will die.
However, I don't think we're going to be disappointed because of what we've learned.
My mother, a Czech Jew, was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi state that had taken him to the house of my foreign ambassador.
He survived and immigrated to the United States, where, 60 years later, he was sent to the table of the swastika symbol to light the Holy Day candle.

"Rangers' Graham Torrens is a ""positive"" forward of the Rapid Vienna clash"
Following a massive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League from Group G.
A knee injury prevented him from playing in the middle of the season from his first appearance this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but Rangers believe he can still use the result as a driving force.
"For us, it's a good thing because Villarreal are good players," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game hoping we could get a win.
We may have been a little off at the end, but overall, the draw was a bit of a fair decision.
They may have played well in the first half, but in the second half we took the game and became the better side.
It's going to be another great Thursday night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but we think we can put some pressure on ourselves and get a positive result.
"Amid all my injuries last year and the changes in the club, it was definitely tough, but it's a good thing for the club right now.
The staff is very friendly, the kids are very well behaved and the training is very good.
We hope that we will be able to continue to grow, and we hope that we will be able to continue to grow.
Women are afraid to go to sleep because they are afraid of the effects of stress.
In fact, some people even talk to their family members about it, even when it's a fact that the participants in the poll had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves.
Nearly half of those surveyed said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to talk about it," says Halley Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is where we should start.
Talk to your life partner and children: If you don't tell them your wishes while you have the time, you can't prepare your family.
Plan together with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to obtain care, since such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Even your advisor can come up with ways for you to pay for such expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care include a traditional long-term care insurance plan, a hybrid cash-value insurance plan to take care of those costs, or, as long as you have money, keep your own assets and self-insured.
Make a decision on your legal documents: End the legal battles.
Instead, appoint a health care provider who will supervise your medical care and see to it that the experts supervise your preferences when you are unable to speak.
Also, make sure you have a budget in place to manage your finances.
Choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and pay for your expenses when you can't.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Can you tell us about the medications and treatments you are taking?
Write them down on a piece of paper so that you are prepared.
“Funds are not the only important thing, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?"
Who takes care of the dog?
You have a plan for that."
A man with an air rifle fired several times in Ilfracombe
When he returned home, he was shot multiple times with an air rifle.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Dewan, Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The shooting, which took place at 2.30pm BST, was described as "non-targeted."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, with the death toll likely to rise, officials said.
Relief officials were unable to get any information from the Tongala area, which is very close to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, north of the city of Palu.
In the city of Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here are the important facts about the Palu and Donggala regions on the island of Sulawesi:
Balu Nagar is the capital of the central Sulawesi region, located at the end of the narrow Gulf on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Tongala is a region that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The region is an administrative region under one province, with a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Bali and Tongala have been hit by multiple tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed more than 100 homes in Tongala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck western Tongala, killing nine people.
Geographically, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake strikes 14 countries off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in the Aceh region
In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, just off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 - A 6.8-magnitude earthquake strikes the southern part of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, triggering a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009 - A 7.6 magnitude earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010 - A 7.5-magnitude earthquake strikes one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres high, destroying more than 12 villages and killing nearly 300 people.
2016: In Aceh, a small earthquake struck the Beedi Jaya region, causing destruction and devastation, as people remember the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died in the building collapse.
2018 - Indonesia's tourist island of Lampak is hit by large-scale earthquakes, mostly in the northern part of the island, killing more than 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and forced thousands of tourists to evacuate.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Trac Paulin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Paulin, has been arrested on trumped-up charges.
According to a statement released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Pauline, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and under the Prevention of Interference and Detention of Domestic Violence Statement.
According to the police report, the woman snatched his phone from him when he was trying to call the police to inform them of the alleged crime.
The KTUU reports that Balin is being held at Mad-su Pretrial Prison and is being held on $500 unsecured bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, upon hearing his appeal, he declared that he had "absolutely committed no crime."
Paul is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which could result in a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Mr. Putin.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Dodd Ball.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report that he had been beaten up.
The case is still pending in a former military court in Alaska.
In January 2016, she was accused of stalking her home, interfering with a domestic violence report, and using her hand while intoxicated.
He accused his friend of punching him in the face.
He was blacklisted by a group of ex-servicemen in 2016 after linking the violent behaviour of Sarah Palin's son to PTSD and removing him from the force in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: Death toll mounts to 100
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
As the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days, electricity and communication networks have been cut off.
The earthquake struck just outside the Indonesian capital, Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta.
Videos of the incident are going viral on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu after the tsunami washed up.
Federal prosecutors have rarely called for the death penalty for anyone suspected of being involved in the NYC terror attack.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Tsai, who is suspected of being involved in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been awarded in the country since 1953.
Saibov, 30, was charged with using a home depot rental truck to carry out an attack in lower Manhattan, on a bike path on the side of the West Side Highway, in October, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Tzaipov "deliberately" killed the eight men and "deliberately" caused severe bodily injuries, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty in New York's Southern District.
According to court documents, both could face the death penalty.
In the weeks following the attack, a federal grand jury imposed a 22-count sentence on Tsai, which included the murder of eight people for dishonest, fraudulent conduct, the systematic use of federal prosecutors in well-planned criminal prosecutions, as well as the offence of violence and vandalism.
Prosecutors said the attack required "extreme planning and deep thinking," describing how Leipov staged this "horrible, brutal, vicious" act.
“Saifullo Habibulevi<0xC4><0x87> <0xC5><0xA0>ipov, injury, harm, and Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Terrene Drake, Ariel Erlig, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Mendoza, and Alejandro Damien describe the loss as a loss to the Bagnako Agio family.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has carried out the death penalty for more than a decade.
The man, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
The last New York federal execution was in 1953, for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two years after they were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Uzbekistans Zaypov did not appear to have regretted it in the days and months following the attack.
He told police he was happy with what he was doing.
According to the indictment documents, Tsai told the authorities that she was eager to carry out such attacks only after she had seen ISIS videos.
Police said he requested to fly the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he had seen the 22-count charge-sheet and did not regret it.
One of the central government lawyers who argued for the slope said the court's decision was "obviously painful."
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty will only prolong the suffering of all those involved, rather than accept a life sentence with no possibility of release," Batten said.
Prosecutors had previously asked state prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory MPs say Nigel Farage should put them in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "collect the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Freedom Party, from the harsh criticism emanating from the European Union, said politicians should be "burdened" with the crisis - because Theresa May, one of their own MPs, was in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boone, who is no longer in charge of the Conservative Party, told a walk-in protest in Birmingham that if he had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have "come out" by this time.
However, Mrs May's supporters have underscored the challenge she faces in dislodging her deeply divided leaders, joining a separate campaign against Brexit in the city.
The leader has been hampered by attacks from Brexit supporters, Rembrandt supporters and the European Union, which he has been unable to carry out as planned.
Despite the political opposition, the allies insisted that he would go forward in trying to strike a deal with Brussels - forcing EU hard-line critics and the Labour Party to choose his plans or 'disgrace'.
Mr Bon said during the 'Exit If You Leave' protest in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw out the farmhouse projects'.
He said Mr Farage should have made them all familiar and given them the responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have come out this time," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will stand by Brexit, but we have to throw away the farmhouse plans.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not waged world wars to keep quiet.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bohn categorically denied that people's opinions had changed since the 2016 referendum: 'It is absolutely untrue to say that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU.'
The marchers included Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who told reporters: Let me simply say: Prime Minister, let the people listen.
"The fact that the farm house schemes are unpopular with the public, not voting in favour of the opposition, and its unpopularity with our party, our servants who are going to the polls, were the ones who chose us in the first place.
Please stop talking and listen to the people.”
In a special message to Smt May, he said that the Prime Minister is doing his job while fulfilling his promises.
Mr Farage said at the rally that if they were going to betray the 2016 resolution, they should make the politicians "feel the crisis."
"It's a matter of trust between us - the people and our political class," he said.
"They want to betray the outcome of the Brexit conference, and we're here today to say we won't let you do that," he said.
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class feel the crisis, which is going to betray the results of the Brexit conference.
"We are mobilizing the people of this country, who gave us victory at the Brexit conference, and we will never stop until we become a free, self-governing, and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the Remainer walked through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After launching the group this weekend, a small group of activists joined hands to watch the Tory against the Brexit banners.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservative Party for a security issue in a party app as he opened the convention.
"They're the ones who said they're going to establish an IT system, a barrier-free border for Canada and a barrier-free trade in Ireland," he said.
"""This is absolutely ridiculous."
"There's no such thing as a good strategy," he said.
Trump is "thinking" about running for president.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she is "thinking seriously about running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall speech in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff DeHaul, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Many expected him to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The event, held in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, was the 36th time Trump has used the city hall system since he took office.
One of them asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren said the time had come for "women to go to Washington and a woman to lead our broken government."
Man who shot LSU's Sims arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said they had arrested a man suspected of shooting LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced at an 11 a.m. ET press conference that they had arrested Tyson Simpson, 20.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
In the early hours of Friday, Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University.
"Vaidya was shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
When he tried to save his friend, Simpson shot him dead.
During interrogation, Simpson admitted to being present at the scene, armed with a weapon, and shooting Veyde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Bayton Roe Parish Police.
The 6-foot-6-inch junior, born and raised in Baton Rouge, The Simpsons, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to winning a world title after ordering Sebastian Vettel
Ever since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes' order will play a big role in the race.
Right from the start, Potts got off to a good start, almost driving Hamilton away in the first two rounds, maintaining his position and attacking Vettel himself.
Vettel first went into the pits and left Hamilton to get stuck in traffic at the end of the pack, which must have been the deciding factor.
Mercedus later corrected himself and came after the cut, but Hamilton drove the wheels off and went ahead, leaving the inner margin unafraid of Ferrari's driver, who dared to take the double-movement to protect the third corner.
Max Verstappen, starting from the back of Gritt, was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for most of the season, finishing the race quickly and aiming for Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He eventually got into the pits in the 44th round, but as Raykonen finished fourth, he was unable to increase his speed for the remaining eight rounds.
It was a hard day, because Vettori had done an amazing job the whole weekend, and he was a civilized man.
Hamilton said the team has done a great job of taking first and second place.
It's a really bad body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, at the urging of Christine Blasey Ford, who leaked a letter from Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh accusing her of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said instead that what was happening in the Senate shows that the people were "fearless, shameless and untrustworthy."
"It's something that can happen and the beautiful things that have been happening in the Senate over the last few days that when you look at the anger, you see the people being angry, awful, shameless, and untruthful," he said.
"When you look at the publications and leaks, then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I did not do it."
Do you remember ?
Dwayne, are you blind?
Remember his reply... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disappear."
All right, wait a minute.
We said, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no.
The letter went to Feinstein in July detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh, which they leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He kept it a secret, and I kept it a secret as he asked."
But his refusal did not bode well for the president, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you what it is, it's really bad physical abuse.
He might not have done it, but it was, in fact, the worst physical abuse I have ever seen."
The Supreme Court, which has accused three women of sexual misconduct, said the president and the Democrats used the allegations for their own personal gain in order to defend the appointee.
"They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
"You've seen that frivolity, the gaffe, and they don't care who they hurt or who they trample on to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
He scored two goals against Dundee for Patrick Twyer's Giants
On Saturday, the Dundee Stars compensated for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in a rematch at Dundee.
The Giants, Patrick Dwyer and Frances Bevillier took a two-goal lead from the bottom.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Gawney equalized before Twyer returned to lead the Giants.
Frances Pachyderm equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundold Nielsen scored two goals.
That, to Adam Keef's team, was the third Elite League defeat of the season, and they were the only ones to beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides in which the Giants had won the previous three games.
Twyer's opening game came in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m., assisted by a Kendal McFall, who was assisted by David Rutherford, who doubled the lead four minutes later.
Early in the excitement, Sullivan brought his own team back into the game at 13:10, just before Matt Marquardt was drafted into the side to help Gownie's equaliser at 15:16.
When Twyer scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first leg, he saw the Giants take the lead on the first break.
The home team put together again, with Bachard scoring a Power Play goal at 27:37 to level the score.
Gough and Charles Corcoran, together, helped Dundee take the lead for the first time in the second half of the game, and saw him through his team's fifth half to the final.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games so far, will move on to their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller D<0xC3><0xAD>az, you have to see that hundreds of people on the plane escape from the earthquake
A traffic controller in Indonesia has rescued a plane carrying hundreds of people from the ground and is being hailed as a hero after his death.
More than 800 people have died and dozens more are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are ravaging the area, with many trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But as his co-workers ran for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agg refused to leave his seat at the Muatiyara Sis al-Jufri Airport, Palu, in a terrifying control tower.
Battique Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, stayed there to make sure it was flying safely.
Then he thought that the tower was going to collapse and jumped out.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Yohannes Chiraid, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to another major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he said.
Meanwhile, the country's disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Shiki and Patang is limited, and officials fear the death toll could reach thousands.
"While many bodies are still buried, we believe the death toll is likely to rise as many are not able to reach them," said Sutopo Parvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Waves as high as six meters devastated the city of Palu, where a total funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are arriving to deliver aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Clean water is rarely available.
They're taking over the markets."
Jane Zelfandu, president of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll see there.
It's already a disaster, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Baluchinagar on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you to work day and night to complete all the work related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready for that?” he asked.
Earthquakes hit Indonesia earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea now says no one is missing after the saltwater lake plane crash
The airline is operating a plane that fell into a saltwater lake in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia after it previously said all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the plane that was sinking, but now says no one is missing.
Air New Guinea said in a news release that it had not been able to get a male passenger's details as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
After the plane plunged into the water as it was trying to land at Souk Island Airport, the area's boats helped rescue other passengers and crew.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six people remained in the hospital and that all of them are in good health.
It is unclear what caused the accident and what happened next.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane went beyond the runway and plunged into the saltwater lake.
Some people believe that the plane was shot down.
The American pilot, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was too low to fly.
"It's a good thing," Jones said.
Jaynes and the rest of the crew jumped out of the plane and into the water.
He said the crew members were frightened and screamed, and he was lightly hit on the head.
According to the US Navy, the crew, who were working in a nearby port, were also using hoverboards to evacuate people before the plane plunged into the water at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades, and not a single one of them is Air New Guinea.
An analysis of the night's hours in which the woman was fated to live
On Saturday, the prosecutor's statement came true during a retrial of a man accused of setting a Mississippi woman on fire in 2014.
US Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
He outlined to the jury how, using cell phone records, he had discovered the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Delis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of the woman's death.
Rowlett claims to have obtained location information from various cellphones that showed Delis had been with Chambers on the evening of his death, and he then reverses what he had said earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
Police went to Sanford to question him when they said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and when reports showed that his cell phone was with Chambers.
Sanford made a decision on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if he was telling the truth, Deliss said he was in Sanford's truck that night, and Sanford said, "He's lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
One of the most important things to remember is that he's been on the disabled list for almost two weeks.
The phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Shortly after Chambers' death, Mr. Rowlett said he had deleted all of the Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He ruined her life," she said.
The parties will present their final arguments on Friday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to trial later that day.
The High Priestess: What is Spiritual Hip Hop?
The three-member hip hop group wants to challenge their music with positive messages to change the negative impact of their genre.
High Breed, from Bristol, says the group has moved away from its source of hip hop music and political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and popularize soulful hip - hop music again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common, through artists such as Agla and Loki, have seen a resurgence in the UK recently.
Another black one?!
A New York nurse has filed a lawsuit against a couple after they received a "racist" text message.
A New York woman has sued a New York mother for allegedly discriminating against her after she received a text message that said she was "another black woman."
The couple denied that they were racist and said the case was tantamount to "stealing money."
The mother of two, Linci Blasco-Fluxman, said she was saddened to see Giselle Maris, a nurse who came to work on the first day in 2016, as black.
Mrs. Plaskow-Flexmann sent her husband a text saying, "Do you want another black man?"
But instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent it to Mrs. Morris.
After realizing his inadvertence, the "comfortable" Plasco-Flixman told Maurice that his grandmother, who had already worked for him, was African-American and not doing well, and that he had left the job and sent a Filipino to work for him, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris gave him one day's wages for his work and sent him home via Uber.
Mr Morris, who has since been laid off, has sued the couple for compensation of $350 a day for six months, saying he has already agreed to stay and work with them, although he has not signed a contract.
"Look here, I'm going to show them they can't do something like this," he said, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple refused to say they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to leave Maris when they feared they would not be able to trust her after she left.
"My wife sent me something I didn't want to tell her.
She is not racist.
"We're not racists," her husband, Joel Flasco, told The Post.
"But even if it were wrong, would you give your child into the hands of someone who was rude?"
Is that your baby?
tell you."
Flasko compared the case to a "bloodthirsty" act, saying that his wife had just been two months pregnant and that he was in "a very difficult situation."
Do you want to support someone like that?
"It's not that bad," said the banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the Court of Public Opinion has condemned the 50-year-old on social media, severely attacking their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers feared that they would not be like the bear speaking to the readers
Bond's daughter Karen Zankel, born shortly after his adoption, said of the letter: "It is difficult to make one think in terms of who is reading the book for the first time.
It's great to know what we know about Paddington's biggest hit."
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman with a little bear doll, before being inspired to write a children's book, would have been pained by the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was therefore "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
Speaking about Paddington, he described him as "the most important member of our family" and said that his father was very proud of his gradual success.
"He was a quiet man, but he wasn't a quiet man," she said.
"But Paddington said that because they were so real to him, it was for him, when your child accomplished something: even if you didn't do it, it was like being proud of you.
I think he's seen his success.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he always gave them credit for it."
My daughter was dying, and I had to give her the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Nice hospital, where doctors fought to save her life in vain.
"Night is always on the phone, it's so bad, I didn't expect to be able to," Ms. Labrous said.
Then I got a phone call from her and she said she was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
I replied.
"I like you, Taehyung," I said.
I'll get back to you soon, Dad.
I'll go with you, Dad.
In order to keep her heart beating, the medicines given by the doctors also started to malfunction a little bit and left her body.
She had been dead for some time, which meant that each member had stopped functioning.
Before I knew it, I was sitting there waiting.
I couldn't cry, crawl, or cry because of the family and others around me.
I had to put everything together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Labrous, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, went through the ordeal, not knowing what was going on around her - and boarded the plane with the other passengers.
"Nobody knows," she said.
"I was in tears and I cried all day.
It's hard to explain, but it's a feeling I can't control when I'm on a plane for the day.
He needed my love and support.
I know what she likes."
Sad women giving information cards on the bridge, to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones due to suicide, while others are struggling to prevent them from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are handing out cards containing reassuring news and helpline numbers at a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression when he was 13 and took his own life when he was 18.
"I don't want to see my parents suffer," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a fantastic cook who would put a smile on the face of the next person.
"Everybody knows he's going to bounce back.
And they say, “He’s never going to be able to do anything about it.”
But before he left, he said, "It's not working."
In 2014, his brother, Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, saw him after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that something is going to happen."
"Mrs. Davis," she said, "is someone you go to to tell people that you're going to be there."
“Do not be silent, and do not speak.”
Mrs. Humphrey, who had been Miss Davis's friend for many years, lost her companion, Mark, who had lived with her for 15 years, shortly before her mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sick or being sick," she said.
"It was just a couple of days before Christmas that we noticed a change in his mood.
He was so depressed on Christmas Day that even when the children opened their presents, he didn't look up and didn't see anything."
He said that his death was a great retribution for them and that he had to bear it: “It caused confusion in the family.
It's broken us in two.
But we have to fight it all."
If you are struggling to cope with the loss, you can call the Samaritans organization, 116 123 (UK and Ireland) for free, or email the address jo<0x40>samarines.org or visit the Samaritans website.
Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy as the FBI begins an investigation
"If we get what he's asking for, and that's exactly what we have - a limited trial in anticipation of completion in a given amount of time - I thought we might be able to bring a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the group was "falling apart" amid a deadlock between irreversible parties.
Why, Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters don't want the FBI to investigate?
It's time to be compassionate and considerate.
The by-elections are still five weeks away, and if the November 6 - as expected - referendums fail, then they will be weakened in their attempt to get whoever they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush had called the Senators and had invited Mr. Kanae, who worked for him in the White House, to meet with Mr. Bush's personal secretary, his wife, Ashley, and had him pick up the phone to call for support.
What would happen if the FBI found out?
There are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate at the moment.
It is not known if Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 percent of the vote in the Senate vote, which will likely end Vice President Mike Pence's tug-of-war and secure him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's regime, the number of people leaving North Korea has "fallen"
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
According to Park Byang-Ceuk, according to data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, 1,127 people left the country last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the most important factors were the tight border control between North Korea and China and the high cost of listening to human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comment.
Most of those who left North Korea were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which is the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the DMZ, the most heavily guarded border between the two Koreas.
China considers North Korean defectors as illegal immigrants and often force them into exile.
Relations between North and South Korea - both still at war - have made remarkable progress in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, focusing on the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed on broad terms to work in the direction of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in the security of our country, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will lay down our arms first," Mr. Awgrall said while speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "crazy" and unfit for the Supreme Court.
The council's minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court "crazy" and said he was not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court because of his animalistic nature.
Pelosi made the comments during an interview with the Texas Tribune on Saturday in Austin, Texas.
On Thursday, in response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Pelosi said, “I can’t say that, but I think if a woman ever did, she’d say they were <0xE2><0x80><0x98>crazy’.”
Gawana and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford have denied allegations that they sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.
At the time of his opening statement, Gawana was found to be very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and gagging while discussing his family and his years in high school.
He openly denounced the Democrats in the committee and denounced the charges against him, calling them "an outrageous and coordinated massacre" organized by the liberals after Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court because his testimony showed that he was biased in favor of the Democrats.
"I think with his statements, and with the way he went after the Clinton family and the Democrats, he's made himself eligible," he said.
When Pelosi was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was found guilty and if Democrats had a majority in the House, she was reluctant to respond.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth to the House or to the FBI, he is unfit not only for the Supreme Court, but even for the court where he is standing right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said she was concerned about the rulings Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she thinks of him as an old-time judge, as a Democrat.
When asked if he would change the Supreme Court's decision, he declined to answer.
"It's not the right time for a crazy, one-sided person to go to court, and we'll say, 'That's not so elegant,'" Pelosi said.
All women have to fight for it.
It's a fair word warp, one that's been raging in anger for months, for years, and he can't say it out without crying.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Ms. Steinem, 45 years after they had me.
“That’s not going to happen, is it?”
He went on to say that a woman who was an officer at some point was very helpful to me, and even when he was angry, he used to cry, but he developed a strategy, that is, when he got angry and started crying, he would tell the person he was talking to and say, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I am furious."
Needless to say, he’s going to be gone.
I think that's a wonderful idea."
To some extent, we allow tears as a way of expressing our anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One thing I remember best from my early work was that in an office dominated by men, I was found to be weeping in unexpressed anger, and then, there was always an angry manager I was afraid of - an old lady who grabbed my neck - and led me up the stairs.
"You'll never see me cry," he said.
"They don't know you're sick.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to make you feel that way."
Patrick Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, was working with Gary Hart, for his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat in what he called a "monkey business" while having sex with another woman outside of marriage and was forced to stand for election, Miss Schrder was so disgusted that she said she had no reason to explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It's not easy," he said with a smile, "but it's been a long time."
"There were already seven other candidates in the fray, and they needed at least one more.
One of them said, “It’s like a snowflake, it’s like a snowflake, it’s like a rainbow.”
Because it was the final phase of the campaign, he was behind the fundraising, and he then swore that if he couldn't raise $2 million, he wouldn't enter the contest.
It was a losing battle.
It was only then that he realized that some of his supporters, who paid $1,000 to the men, would give him only $250.
They were astonished and said, "Do they think that I have [any] rebate?"
When he began his speech by saying that he was not going to launch a proper campaign, he became increasingly emotional - thanks to the people who are going to support him, the organization that has made it so difficult to raise money that it has had to target voters more than representatives - because of his anger over sex.
When asked how she felt about the incident, she said, "I think I might have had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder said.
"You may have noticed that I'm a fan of Clint Eastwood.
I wonder what they're going to put on my wall.
"Is she crying?" and so on.
The U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing
While the initial counter-attacks of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and the war did not seem to end, experts say the split between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major exports, including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The new significant conflict erupted this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, which would have cut half of all goods coming from China into the United States.
Each time Beijing responded in a similar fashion, most recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of US goods.
China is determined to beat the United States, the world's second-largest economy, and there is no time to blink.
To push Washington back means to comply with the demands, but to openly blow up the US would be a very uncomfortable situation for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, if Beijing uses its troops correctly, the US trade war crises will benefit China in the long run by reducing its dependence on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could trigger an economic reversal in either of the two countries is far more frightening to the spectator than has ever been agreed upon," said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher who focuses on Asia in The Center for New American Security, who is a thinker.
Syria's foreign minister says he is ready to return to the country
Syria has said it is ready for voluntary repatriation of refugees and has called for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moullam said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
To bring back normalcy, the government is constantly repairing the areas destroyed by the terrorists.
All conditions exist for the voluntary return of refugees, who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that directly targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moullam said he welcomed the Syrian government's assistance in rebuilding the war-ravaged country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that support terrorism.
UEFA Champions League: France beat Belgium to lift title
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
Since 1993, the U.S. team has suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has never won the Ryder Cup.
The European team regained the title after Danish captain Thomas Jones scored 14.5 points to defeat the U.S. team.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had stumbled across Tornament, sank his tee-shot into the water on the 16th hole of Bar-3, hiding his game with Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, has shined throughout all of his rounds and has become one of 4 players to go 5-0-0 since this tournament's current system began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth, the lowest-ranked athlete in the European team, was defeated by Denmark's Tarfjorn Olesen by 5 & 4.
The world's first-ranked athlete, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Boulter, who may have played in his final Ryder Cup match.
Spain's Sergio Garcia became the most successful European in all of Tornamento with 25.5 points in eight Ryder Cups.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold back.
It has been a difficult year.
I want to thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have the cup back.
It was about the team, and I’m happy that I was able to do that,” said passionate Garcia, following the European win.
He gave the ball to his native countryman John Ram, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in singles game 2&1 on Sunday.
"I was incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said Ram, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now holds the Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
The weird statistic held by one of the greatest athletes of all time, only behind Jack Nicklaus, who has won 14 major titles.
The US team, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Faina, struggled to find the fairways on all weekends, playing high-end golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Farick said after the team's painful performance: "I'm proud of them and they fought to the best of their ability."
This morning, it was time for a bit of a change of pace.
We have lost.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 players played well.
We will get back together, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward."
I love these guys and I'm proud to be one of them.
We have to push them.
They played better than us."
According to the latest data, the incidence of encephalitis has decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that in some areas of the Tampa Bay area, redfish consumption has generally declined.
According to the FWC, extreme flowering conditions were reported in Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a reduction in sedatives.
The blooming of the red sea extends along the coast, from the northern Pinellas and south Lee counties, for nearly 130 miles.
The patches can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough, but in a few places compared to last week.
Redfish were also found in Basco County.
Moderate to high concentrations were reported in Pinellas County or beyond the coast last week, with low to high densities off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high levels in Manati County, low to high levels in Sarasota County, above-scarce and above-scarcity in County County, low to high levels in County County, and low to high levels in County of Charlotte, and low to moderate levels in Lee County.
Respiratory distress has been reported in Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
There has been no reported case of respiratory syncope in northwest Florida over the past week.
